He never imagined his own son would become part of the stampede.\nHe says they\u2019ve not spoken in the three years since he discovered to his horror from their local newspaper that David Broccoli was registered as a candidate in municipal elections for Le Pen\u2019s anti-European Union, anti-immigration National Front.\n\u201cI said to myself, \u2018Impossible! What\u2019s happened to him?\u2019 I called him up. We argued. He told me, \u2018That\u2019s the way it is\u2019 and hung up on me,\u201d Walter Broccoli says. \u201cI\u2019ve had nightmares where I saw him dressed in an SS uniform, all in black, with a cap. I took it very hard. It shocked me: my son, in the National Front? Impossible. Unbearable.\u201d\nYet the National Front is now an inescapable part of the landscape in France\u2019s industrial eastern rustbelt and its once left-leaning towns. Le Pen is projected to win millions of votes Sunday in the first round of France\u2019s two-stage presidential election, likely catapulting her to within one step of an electoral earthquake that would shake France and the EU to its core.\nDisgruntled working-class voters will cast ballots for the anti-establishment Le Pen not solely out of conviction but also in protest. She is their nuclear option, their way to flip the bird at the French political mainstream they feel has betrayed and abandoned them.\nSteel worker Pascal Grimmer doesn\u2019t share Le Pen\u2019s politics; he doesn\u2019t, like her, want a \u201cFrexit\u201d to take France out of the EU or to ditch its shared euro currency. But she will get his vote because he\u2019s \u201cangry with politicians, filled with rage,\u201d and \u201cshe is the candidate who most scares the others,\u201d Grimmer says.\nHe hopes that an electro-shock-high score for Le Pen \u2014 not quite enough to install her in the presidential Elysee Palace but an uncomfortably close shave \u2014 will jolt more mainstream politicians \u201cto use their brains to ask themselves, \u2018What do people want?'\u201d\n\u201cYou reap what you sow. And our politicians have treated the French people like idiots,\u201d he says. \u201cPoliticians don\u2019t fulfill their promises. They lie as easily as they breathe.\u201d\nLast time, Grimmer voted Francois Hollande, the Socialist whose presidency, now in its final weeks, lasted just one term, sunk by his unpopularity.\nGrimmer was impressed when Hollande came stumping during the 2012 campaign for working-class votes at the ArcelorMittal steel plant where he works. Labor leaders were in the thick of their battle to save Hayange\u2019s furnaces, the last in eastern France still serving the steel industry.\nIncongruous in his suit and tie, Hollande clambered onto the roof of a van with union leaders, took a microphone and promised to push for a law to help save plants facing closure. The crowd, which included Grimmer, cheered. In a seemingly trivial detail, but one which workers subsequently wouldn\u2019t let him forget, Hollande even shared a spicy barbecued \u2018merguez\u2019 sausage with them.\n\u201cI said to myself, \u2018Oh, I like this guy.\u2019 Naively, I believed him,\u201d Grimmer recalls. \u201cI was completely hoodwinked.\u201d\nGrimmer and others felt betrayed when the furnaces were extinguished in 2013, as part of a deal the Socialist government struck with steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal seven months after Hollande\u2019s election. Hollande beat conservative Nicolas Sarkozy, another one-term president under whom ArcelorMittal also closed a plant in nearby Gandrange.\nThe deal included jobs elsewhere or retirement for furnace workers. ArcelorMittal also promised to invest 180 million euros ($190 million at today\u2019s rates) in other sectors of the giant steel works, which still produce high-grade metals for automakers and other clients and sprawl across three towns, including Hayange, in the Fensch valley.\nWorkers had hoped for more. The mothballing of the furnaces that used to turn the skies incandescent red, dust soot over the valley\u2019s towns and draw laborers from across Europe and North Africa hit hard. In a final show of defiance, Grimmer, Broccoli and other members of their Workers\u2019 Force union unveiled a plaque of protest in Hayange when the scorching fires which had melted ores into metal went cold.\n\u201cSELLOUT,\u201d the plaque read. \u201cHere lie the promises of change that F. HOLLANDE made to workers and their families.\u201d\nStill bitter, Grimmer says: \u201cPoliticians are forcing me to vote Le Pen. That\u2019s why I\u2019m doing this. Not with a happy heart but because I\u2019m forced to. And increasing numbers of French people are starting to think this way.\u201d\nAnd if Le Pen wins?\n\u201cSo be it. They will have to live with that,\u201d he says.\nBroccoli says he warned Socialist officials that extinguishing the furnaces would be \u201celectoral suicide.\u201d Sure enough, the year after they were put out, Hayange voted in a National Front mayor in 2014 \u2014 one of just a handful of towns in France to do so.\n\u201cIt really hurts me to see workers turning toward fascism, the extreme right,\u201d Broccoli says. \u201cThey are so angry that they are prepared to vote National Front, to destroy everything. They have nothing left to lose.\u201d\nBroccoli\u2019s son, a computer technician, doesn\u2019t work in the steel industry. Still, the father assumes his son felt \u201cabandoned by the government\u201d after losing a job in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, leaving him unable to pay rent. He says the son moved in with his mother, also a National Front supporter. The parents are separated.\n\u201cI feel as though he\u2019s been stolen from me,\u201d Walter Broccoli says. \u201cAll these people \u2014 like his mother, his stepfather \u2014 they weren\u2019t like this 15 or 20 years ago. It happened gradually.\u201d\nDavid Broccoli didn\u2019t respond to calls and a text message from The Associated Press. Herve Hoff, who stood with him as a National Front candidate in 2014, says David Broccoli and his mother \u201cadopted our ideas because they felt that the left had betrayed them. Simple as that.\u201d\nHoff, a restaurateur, is now seeking election to parliament. He proudly showed the AP his letter from the National Front investing him as its candidate in the Fensch valley in June legislative elections. Saying Le Pen appeals to \u201cforgotten people,\u201d he drew parallels with Donald Trump\u2019s election to the White House, won with strong support from disgruntled workers in coal country.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have the same phenomenon. Deepest France, rural France, will lift up Marine Le Pen and you\u2019ll see villages where she\u2019ll get crazy scores,\u201d he says.\nMichel Liebgott, the valley\u2019s current lawmaker, a Socialist, handily beat a National Front opponent last time. This time, he\u2019s not so confident. If he decides against running again, he says the National Front could win the seat.\nLiebgott, who was born in the valley and remembers Hayange as its jewel, a bustling steel town, says the region is dividing between haves and have-nots. Many of the better-off work across the nearby border with Luxembourg, braving gnarled traffic on the highway to Luxembourg City for higher wages in its services economy. An estimated 90,000 such jobs have helped fill voids left by decades of steel plant and mine closures in France.\n\u201cThe poor are here. The others have gone elsewhere,\u201d Liebgott says.\nWith the benefit of hindsight, the lawmaker says Hollande\u2019s campaign stop in the valley in 2012 \u201cwas bloody stupid.\u201d It gave steel workers false hope that the furnaces, which had long been earmarked for closure, could be saved.\nNow firmly ensconced in Hayange, where the eyesore furnaces dominate the skyline, National Front Mayor Fabien Engelmann says he did not propose saving them because that would have been \u201cimpossible.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t lie to my voters. I offered them a coherent program: security, cleanliness, lower taxes, reduced debts, road building, work on schools \u2014 things a mayor can do,\u201d he says smugly.\nThe unemployment rate in Hayange is 14 percent, the mayor says \u2014 above the already high national average of 10 percent.\nJean-Paul Holtz sees the decaying cathedrals of once-belching pipes and chimneys from his windows. The drum player in Hayange\u2019s brass band spent all his working life in steel plants, starting as a 14-year-old apprentice. Now 66 and retired, he wishes the furnaces could be torn down because \u201cit makes me sick to the stomach to see them like that.\u201d\nHoltz plans to vote for far-left presidential candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon, who is making a late surge in polls.\n\u201cPeople came to set up industries, money was made, people were provided with jobs. But it\u2019s over, finished,\u201d Holtz says. \u201cWe have to move on. Will we move on? When? I don\u2019t know. It drags on and on and on, rusting away.\u201d"}
{"id":"b36b7aaf-4bac-4f47-b62f-e341be4759a4","text":"New drug approvals fall to six-year low in 2016\nBy Ben Hirschler\nLONDON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Last year turned out to be a disappointing one for new drug approvals with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearing just 22 new medicines for sale, the lowest number since 2010 and sharply down on 2015's tally of 45.\nAcross the Atlantic, the European Medicines Agency recommended 81 new prescription products against a 2015 total of 93. Unlike the FDA, the EMA includes generic drugs in its list.\nThe slowdown suggests the pharmaceuticals industry may be returning to more normal productivity levels after a spike in approvals in 2014 and 2015, when the haul of new drugs reaching the market hit a 19-year high.\nSeveral factors led to the fall in the approval rate in 2016, John Jenkins, the FDA's director of the office of new drugs, told a conference last month.\nNotably, five new drugs that had been scheduled for approval in 2016 ended up winning an early green light at the end of 2015. There was also a decline in drugs being filed for approval and the FDA rejected or delayed more applications in 2016 than in the previous two years.\nSome of the delayed drugs may yet go on to win approval in 2017, including Roche's multiple sclerosis treatment Ocrevus and Sanofi and Regeneron's sarilumab for rheumatoid arthritis.\nMost industry executives remain upbeat about the hunt for new medicines, given recent advances in fighting cancer and an improved understanding of the genetic basis of other diseases, which has resulted in full development pipelines at many firms.\nBut it remains challenging to get new drugs through the approval process and to secure a decent financial return once they are launched, given resistance from healthcare insurers and governments to the rising cost of medical treatment.\nAccording to consultancy Deloitte, returns on research and development investment at the top 12 pharmaceutical companies fell to just 3.7 percent in 2016 from a high of 10.1 percent in 2010.\nIncreasing political pressure over the high prices of many modern medicines is a growing challenge at a time when biotech and pharma companies are developing more drugs targeted at niche patient populations.\nThe issue is exemplified by the last drug to win FDA approval in 2016. Spinraza, from Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals, is the first medicine to treat patients with spinal muscular atrophy, a rare and often fatal genetic disease. It comes at a huge cost of $125,000 per dose.\nThat price, implying a total cost of $625,000 to $750,000 for patients in the first year and $375,000 in subsequent years, is likely to invite \"a storm of criticism, up to and including Presidential tweets\", according to Leerink analysts.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has vowed to bring down drug prices."}

Ever since E! cancelled The Soup in 2015, we\u2019ve had to blindly guess what was happening in the world of forgotten shows. But thanks to The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale, we can now revel in the highlights of bad TV on a weekly basis. However, McHale\u2019s latest talk show has replaced one pop culture mystery with another. Exactly how tall is Joel McHale, and why do all of his guests look tiny?\nThis has been a question that\u2019s haunted The Joel McHale Show since its first episode, but it became more pressing after Seth Green stopped by this past Sunday. Green, named the resident bully of The Joel McHale Show, spent most of his time on set crouching behind a fence. Even when he finally stood up, it became clear that Green is a significantly shorter man than McHale. But just how short are we talking?\nMcHale is a pretty tall man by any standard. According to the CDC\u2019s Anthropometric Reference Data for Children and Adults in the United States, the average height for a non-Hispanic white man between the ages of 40 and 59 years old is 69.9 inches, which translates to between 5 feet 9 inches and 5 feet 10 inches. In comparison, McHale is 76 inches tall, or 6 foot four.\nConversely, Green is a full foot shorter than McHale. The actor, comedian, and Robot Chicken creator is 64 inches, or 5 foot 4 inches, tall. So that would mean that Green is about 84.21 percent of Joel McHale\u2019s height, which is why delightful images like this can be found on Getty:\nHowever, it\u2019s not just that this one guest star is shorter than the average man. Over the past five weeks, four out of McHale\u2019s seven guests have been under McHale\u2019s impressive 6 foot height, and three have been under 5 feet 5 inches. The Joel McHale Show started its shorter-guest-with-a-super-tall-host trend early with the appearances of Kevin Hart and Jason Priestley in Episode 1. Hart is 5 foot four inches and stands at roughly 84.21 percent of McHale\u2019s height. At 5 foot 8 inches, Priestley is a little taller, but he\u2019s still only 89.47 percent of McHale\u2019s height.\nKristen Bell was by far McHale\u2019s shortest guest to date. Standing at 5 foot 1 inch, Bell is only 80.26 percent of the talk show host\u2019s height, which is partially why their segment was so fun together.\nThe only guest who comes close to McHale\u2019s height has been Billy Eichner. The comedian and Donnadorable conspiracy theorist stands at 6 feet 3 inches, meaning that he\u2019s about 98.68 percent of McHale\u2019s height:\nDoes any of this matter in the least? No, not really. However, it is sort of funny to see. There\u2019s an assumption of equality when it comes to talk shows that\u2019s typically mirrored by how these shows are framed. Audiences trust that the people a host chooses to interview are worth paying attention to, and conversely, they have to also trust the interviewer is professional enough to fairly interview them. That dynamic is traditionally reflected by comfy chairs and couches intended to visually position hosts and their guests on the same level, forcing people to pay more attention to the interview itself. However, The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale has never been intended as a traditional talk show, and McHale is a tall dude.\nThe resulting height disparity of the show makes the Netflix series even funnier. There\u2019s always been a slapdash charm to The Soup, and The Joel McHale Show echoes that half-hearted randomness beautifully. McHale has already insulted his writers, guests, and Netflix on his new show many times, and he\u2019s likely going to keep doing it. Of course this show \u2014 which is basically just a comedian talking in front of green screen \u2014 would shrug off the unequal height between its host and guests. Why waste time figuring out visual nonsense when there are Love & Hip Hop clips to dissect?\nStream The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale on Netflix"}

I cannot wait to get out there and show everyone all the hard work that was put into this.\u201d\nWalsh, a freshman dance performance, choreography and pedagogy major, is hoping for a good turnout from the community at the dance concerts April 26-29 at Seton Hill Performing Arts Center in Greensburg.\n\u201cI believe this show offers something for everyone to enjoy, from extremely technical dances to dramatic ones,\u201d Walsh says. \u201cThe cast is filled with amazing dancers who have worked so hard and deserve to have a full audience to appreciate what we have been working on for this semester.\u201d\nThe program features original pieces by two Seton Hill faculty members \u2013 TaMara Swank, assistant professor of dance, and Stefan Zubal, assistant professor of theater and dance \u2013 with guest choreographers Gerard Holt, adjunct ballet instructor and choreographer at Seton Hill, and Aubrey Worek, an adjunct dance professor at the university and dance and fitness instructor in Greensburg.\nSwank has choreographed two pieces for \u201cDance Spectrum,\u201d which she says are very different in both style and concept. \u201cA Walk in the Park\u201d is set to music by Sidney Bechet and is a fun and light-hearted look at love and friendship. \u201cSecond Self\u201d is a high-energy dance piece \u201cthat examines taking on behaviors of those around us and the struggle to maintain a connection with our own self.\u201d\nSwank says she enjoys creating work that is entertaining.\n\u201cI challenged myself to do that for this concert with two very different pieces,\u201d she says. \u201cThroughout the rehearsal process, I also challenged the dancers to consider how they were connecting the movements and how transitions can influence the quality of movement.\u201d\nZubal has contributed three works to the concert; a ballet, a contemporary dance work and a dance for camera featuring tap.\n\u201cThe ballet, \u2018Trio in D Minor,' is homage to my classical ballet roots,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is styled after George Balanchine and features music by Brahms.\u201d\nHis contemporary dance work, \u201cGet Gone,\u201d is a female empowerment piece.\n\u201cThe work opens with voice-overs from our wonderful theater students utilizing \u2018catcalling' from Boals Theatre of the Oppressed and transitions into a dance portion,\u201d he explains.\nHis strong interest in dance technology inspired his third piece, a light-hearted tap dance for camera titled \u201cHoofin'\u201d filmed in the SHU Arts building. \u201cThe dance was supposed to be filmed outside up on the hill and it was far too cold, plus there was snow on the ground,\u201d he says.\nWorek says her piece, \u201cVeiled Transcendence,\u201d takes the audience on a journey from stereotypical college life down a path of uncertainty as the dancers venture out into the \u201creal world.\u201d The work features acrobatics, partner stunts and an impressive lift sequence.\nHolt's contribution to the program is his \u201cLast of the Trojan Women,\u201d loosely based on the play \u201cThe Trojan Women\u201d by Greek playwright Euripides.\n\u201cLike the play, my ballet follows the events that happen to the women of the Trojan royal family, and most of the Trojan women after the siege and sack of the ancient city of Troy,\u201d he says. \u201cI suppose my goal in creating it would be that, at heart, I'm a frustrated ancient historian\u201d with an interest in Biblical history and a goal to create \u201cnew classics\u201d with his work.\nCandy Williams is a Tribune-Review contributing writer."}

Cases involving African Americans also tend to receive less media coverage than missing Whites, with missing men of color getting even less attention.\nNewsOne has partnered with the Black and Missing Foundation to focus on the crisis of missing African Americans.\nTo be a part of the solution, NewsOne will profile missing persons and provide tips about how to keep your loved ones safe and what to do if someone goes missing.\nThe Richmond County Sheriff\u2019s Office says the missing persons case of Georgia teen Latania Janell Carwell is now a homicide investigation.\n\u201cOur primary focus this week is recovering Miss Carwell\u2019s remains,\u201d Richmond County Sheriff Richard Roundtree said at a press conference Monday, reports the Augusta Chronicle. \u201cWe had a search team in the metro Atlanta area come out this weekend and conducted multiple searches in the area, and we will be out again this week conducting additional searches based on forensic evidence that we gather in, but we have not yet located the particular area where we think the remains are.\u201d\nRoundtree said the change in the status of the case comes after the interview of a \u201csubject connected to this investigation.\u201d He did not divulge further details.\nCarwell, 16, is believed to have left her home on April 17 with her stepfather, just 90 minutes after she turned 16. Latania\u2019s mother,says she spoke with her husband, who explained he brought his stepdaughter with him to assist with a GPS system to help find a friend who had car trouble. Police said Tripp\u2019s claim was untrue.\nA kidnapping warrant was issued for Leon Tripp and he was captured and arrested by U.S. Marshals. He is being held on kidnapping charges. Tanya Tripp was also arrested on charges of hindering the apprehension of a criminal after she was found living with her husband in Atlanta.\nLatania has not been seen in public since she left home with her stepfather in April.\nLatania\u2019s uncle Charles Carwell said the family is confounded by news the search is now a homicide.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been eight weeks and at this point we are looking for some closure. That\u2019s not the news we wanted to hear but we want closure. We want to know more now. We need more. That\u2019s partial closure,\u201d Carwell told NewsOne in an interview.\nCarwell now has custody of Tanya Tripp\u2019s other child.\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to explain this to her little sister one day,\u201d Carwell said. \u201cShe was a young, innocent kid. She didn\u2019t deserve this. No one deserves this under any circumstances.\u201d\nNow, Carwell said he wants Tripp and his sister to come clean so Latania can be properly put to rest.\n\u201cOne of those two have to know something. That\u2019s my opinion. Hopefully someone will say something. You\u2019ll get what\u2019s coming to you if you are involved,\u201d Carwell said. \u201cRight now we want closure to close it off in your heart and mind.\u201d\nJeffery C.

{"id":"eb7b55e1-80f5-496a-af2b-624ec337830e","text":"In one of the more performative displays of corporate feminism in recent history, Boston-based State Street Global Advisors made news when it helped place a bronze statue of a defiant young woman directly across from Wall Street\u2019s Charging Bull in Manhattan\u2019s Financial District, in order to celebrate \u201cthe power of women in leadership, and the potential of the next generation of women leaders.\u201d A timely advertising campaign coinciding with International Women\u2019s Day, Kristen Visbal\u2019s Fearless Girl statue quickly drew praise and criticism, leading New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio to weigh in on Twitter: \u201cMen who don\u2019t like women taking up space are exactly why we need the Fearless Girl,\u201d he wrote. The multi-trillion-dollar asset firm had installed the piece of art partially as a promotion for SHE, an exchange-traded fund that only invests in companies with a commitment to gender diversity.\nSince its installment, Fearless Girl has largely become a photo op for tourists who find themselves wandering around on Stone Street. This week, it would seem, it\u2019s also become emblematic of corporate hypocrisy: State Street has agreed to pay $5 million to settle allegations that female and black executives at the firm were paid less than their white, male counterparts. Bloomberg reports that more than 300 employees will receive a payout from the firm after a U.S. Department of Labor audit revealed that since at least December 2010, female State Street senior vice presidents, managing directors, and vice presidents made less in base salary, total compensation, and bonuses than men in the same roles. The audit also revealed that black employees made less than their white counterparts. State Street, which manages $2.6 trillion in assets, was informed of the results of the audit on March 31, the same month the Fearless Girl statue was erected, and rejected the findings. Now, it\u2019s choosing to settle instead of taking the case to court.\nThe firm denies the allegations, and said in a statement that it \u201cis committed to equal-pay practices and evaluates on an ongoing basis our internal processes to be sure our compensation, hiring, and promotions programs are nondiscriminatory.\u201d State Street, which calls on other companies to increase gender diversity on their boards, has a leadership team that\u2019s 82 percent male and nearly entirely white, and this past May voted to promote more men to its executive ranks. And as Bloomberg notes, the firm tends to vote against gender-pay shareholder proposals."}

She said because we have different last name. My guess is because he has a different skin color,\" Gottlieb, who is white, tweeted at Southwest.\n\"She 1st asked for proof with birth certificate. She then said it's a 'federal law' (not true) but asked me to prove I'm mother with Facebook post.What??Mother next to me said she's never been asked for proof despite diff last name..not shockingly, not mixed [race] fam,\" she continued. \"It was demeaning and insensitive, not to mention inefficient. Would have missed flight if it was not delayed. I would advise better training for employees to avoid this happening to others.\"\nIn response to a Twitter user who asked if Gottlieb and her family were OK, she wrote, \"We are fine. It was wild, but, I fear, much more common for people that don't look like me \ud83d\ude22.\"\n\"I felt that in this situation it was my responsibility to say, 'Hey, this isn't OK,'\" Gottlieb said in a follow-up statement to USA Today . \"We had a passport that verified our son's age and identity, and both parents were present. But still being pushed further to 'prove' that he was my son felt disrespectful and motivated by more than just concern for his well-being.\" She added, \"While it was upsetting and emotional, I realize that this was just one day of my life where I was uncomfortable and our family was made to feel 'less than' whereas others face similar situations on a daily basis. I hope the coverage this has received can serve as a learning opportunity and that all families \u2014 regardless of how 'traditional' they may or may not look \u2014 are treated with dignity and respect.\"\nPinterest Marcio Jose Sanchez\/AP\/REX\/Shutterstock\nIn a statement to Teen Vogue , Southwest apologized for the incident. \"We immediately reached out to Ms. Gottlieb to learn more about her concerns and express our apologies; we appreciate her insight in what was a productive conversation. Southwest Airlines' policies include verifying the age of lap children by reviewing birth certificates or government issued identification. Certain international locations require us to verify additional paperwork for those travelling with a minor, including verification of names. Our reports indicate our Employee questioned a discrepancy between last names on the provided documentation, even though domestic travel would not require carriers to match last names of child and guardian. We utilized this situation as a coaching moment to ensure our policies are properly followed,\" the statement read. \"We apologized for the interaction that left this family feeling uncomfortable \u2014 which would never be our intention.\"\nChrissy Teigen , whose two children with husband John Legend are also mixed-race, chimed in on Twitter, noting that while the practice is definitely frustrating and overwhelmingly targets mixed-race families, it's typically for a good reason. \"Airlines have asked this of me, too, with my daughter. once I learned it's a precaution for the very real threat of child trafficking, I stopped being exasperated with it. Now I'm kind of worried when they don't ask,\" Chrissy wrote."}

{"id":"46929b2c-cdc6-4b75-9279-da9b3dc1d289","text":"By Dave Shedloski\nThe Memorial Tournament presented by Nationwide always has been one of the premiere events on the PGA TOUR since its inception in 1976. And its status only seems to grow with legendary host Jack Nicklaus watching over the proceedings.\n\u201cIt\u2019s truly amazing to think that a tournament hosted by golf\u2019s greatest champion in the game and played on one of the greatest golf courses in the game keeps getting better, but the Memorial Tournament continually rises in stature,\u201d said Jim Nantz, longtime CBS Sports golf anchor. \u201cFor someone who treasures the sport and the history of the game as much as I do, it\u2019s truly one of the great weekends of my year.\u201d\nNewly minted world No. 1 Justin Thomas heads a field that includes eight of the top in the world rankings, while five-time Memorial Tournament winner Tiger Woods returns for the first time since 2015. Along with Thomas, all of the other two-time winners on the PGA TOUR this season are entered: Justin Rose (No. 3 in the world and the 2010 Memorial winner), Columbus resident Jason Day, Bubba Watson and Patton Kizzire.\nFormer PGA champion Jason Dufner returns to defend his title.\n\u201cWe virtually have the who\u2019s who of players and virtually everybody\u2019s here, and I think we have probably done pretty well,\u201d the Golden Bear said of the strong 120-player field competing for a purse of $8.9 million.\nNantz, who has worked every Memorial Tournament since 1986, his rookie year on the network, takes a look at the storylines this week in Dublin, Ohio.\n>>WATCH: The Memorial Tournament Live Stream\nThe PGA TOUR calls the Memorial Tournament an enhanced event because of the larger purse and three-year exemption for the winner. I\u2019d argue it\u2019s enhanced because the golf course is superb and Jack Nicklaus is the host. Agree?\nThe tournament is special for a multitude of reasons. This golf tournament has taken on the personality of truly being one of the biggest events in the sport. All you have to do is look at the field list to be dazzled and get the juices flowing. You\u2019ve got a golf course that is ranked among the best in the world, and it\u2019s hosted by the greatest champion in the history of the sport, there\u2019s a lot for the passionate golf fan to get fired up about.\nThis week is a very strong field, with eight of the top 10 in the world and in the FedExCup standings. The Memorial always draws a strong field, but this one seems particularly top heavy.\nIt\u2019s a reflection of what\u2019s going on in the game of golf right now. For those of us who live the sport year-round, we\u2019re seeing wonderful things, [particularly] where the game is going and how it\u2019s trending. And the Memorial is one of those events that brings it all together. You can really sense that the players have a tremendously high regard for Jack Nicklaus and the tournament that he puts on.\nMuirfield Village Golf Club can be an extremely tough test. We saw five-time winner Tiger Woods shoot 85 in the third round in 2015. But it also can yield some good scores. We\u2019ve seen both extremes.\nThere are certainly a lot of places where your game can be exposed in a hurry if you\u2019re off by a fraction. It doesn\u2019t take much, as evidenced by last year\u2019s winner, Jason Dufner, shooting 77 on Saturday and rebounding and still winning. He was just a fraction off in the third round, and it cost him a pair of hockey sticks. I love risk-reward in golf; it brings the sport to a whole new level of drama. You take the best tournaments and the most memorable events we watch, and the term risk-reward is usually a part of it. Just look at major championship golf \u2014 and this really is major championship level. Look at what makes the Masters so great. It\u2019s the risk-reward nature of Augusta National Golf Club. You need highs mixed with the lows. You need the guy who pulls off the impossible shot and the guy who pays the penalty for coming up short. A young Jack Nicklaus knew what he was doing when he built Muirfield Village Golf Club all those years ago. It\u2019s the perfect arena for golf at its best, golf at its most interesting.\n>>MORE: Golf Expert Interviews\nSpeaking of Woods, this is his first appearance here since that tough 2015 outing. What can we expect as he continues to put his game back together?\nHe\u2019s got a tremendous track record at the Memorial Tournament. He\u2019s come a long way in his attempt to rebound from back surgery. He\u2019s been quite a story. But who knows what to expect? He\u2019ll be closely watched, of that I am certain.\nJustin Thomas makes his first start as the No. 1 player in the world. Does that make a difference to a player when he carries that banner? How will he respond?\nWhen Adam Scott became No. 1 for the first time, he won at Colonial (in 2014), so who\u2019s to say we won\u2019t see that kind of response from Justin Thomas? This is a style of golf course that Justin Thomas grew up on. He was raised in these parts. His family has Ohio ties. This should be right in his wheelhouse. The fact that he is No. 1 doesn\u2019t come as any great shock. It comes at a time in golf when there could be a revolving door at the top of the game.\nGive us your favorites and dark horses?\nThere have been guys over the years who have won this golf tournament whom you [would] least expect to win. There have been guys who won for the first time there, like a Kenny Perry and a Tom Lehman. Then you have Jack, Tom Watson, Fred Couples [who] always played well there, and Tiger with his remarkable record. Muirfield Village is a great showcase for many Hall of Famers, so you think about Justin Thomas, Justin Rose, Rory McIlroy, or Jason Day, who has shown tremendous determination to get back to the top of the rankings. And there are many players who appear ready to add their name to the list of winners.\nJournalist and author David Shedloski of Columbus, Ohio, has been covering golf since 1986, first as a daily newspaper reporter and later as a freelance writer for various magazines and Internet outlets. A winner of 23 national writing awards, including 20 for golf coverage, Shedloski is currently a contributing writer for Golf World and GolfDigest.com and serves as editorial director for The Memorial, the official magazine of the Memorial Tournament in Dublin, Ohio.

People were polite, but they were also inept and eventually we decided they were so polite to make up for their incompetence. We showed up at our hotel and they couldn't find our reservation. I produced our confirmation number and they still couldn't find it. Have you ever? They kept searching their computer but came up with nothing, even using the confirmation number.\nTurns out they were overbooked and had no rooms at all, so they found us a bed and breakfast to stay in. Now this was a big hotel with 300 rooms, and they placed us in a B&B. WTF? If we had wanted a B&B, we would have booked one. It was clean, but it had a hot tub in the bedroom. I guess some people would like that, but I hate a bath\/tub in the same room as the bed, there's always a chlorine\/chemical smell.\nWhen we asked for a different room, of course this was all that was available, but they were very polite and apologetic about it. We stayed the night and found a new hotel the next day, but the whole trip was like that, with people barely doing their job and cheerfully apologizing for it. There's something to be said for efficiency with a little rudeness. Reply\nParent\nThread\nLink\nI can confirm about the outside GTA thing. I grew up outside of K-W and lived in Toronto for 4 years for school and honestly everyone here thinks people from Toronto are rude assholes. I think people in Toronto are generally nice, they just have different mannerisms towards social situations. It's normal here for people to talk to strangers or strike up a conversation with people at random, but that's sort of a no-no in Toronto. I prefer the Toronto way tbh lol, don't talk to me random person kthnx.\nPeople here also don't like how people from Toronto (or the GTA in general) seemingly know very little about life outside of the GTA. I remember I was buying gift wrap for a Christmas gift at Hallmark in the Eaton Centre once and the clerk asked where I lived.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nTwitter is accused of not giving the devil his due.\nNot Lucifer himself, but a social activist group called the Satanic Temple, which claims that the social media giant violated its own rules when it suspended the group\u2019s Twitter account and that of its co-founder Lucien Greaves. It has filed a formal complaint against Twitter with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination.\n\u201cGiven the importance of social media platforms, and the outsized power that so few social media giants like Twitter hold over users\u2019 community and business presences, these platforms should reasonably be expected to responsibly and evenly uphold their terms of service in a nonbiased fashion free of discrimination and inexplicable arbitrary pettiness,\u201d Greaves said in a statement. \u201cTo ignore Twitter\u2019s blatant discrimination against the Satanic Temple is to yield ourselves to regressive new world of acceptable online violations against civil liberties.\u201d\nThe Satanic Temple describes itself as a \"nontheistic religious organization dedicated to satanic practice and the promotion of satanic rights\u201d and is based in Salem, Massachusetts, the site of the famous witch trials.\nIt claims that Twitter lowered the boom after Greaves urged his followers to report a Massachusetts resident using the handle @LaurieGatta1, who allegedly urged people to \u201cburn down\u201d the group's Salem headquarters.\nThe Satanic Temple said Greaves' tweet \u201ctook wing\u201d when actor Corey Feldman retweeted it.\nFor that, the group claims, Twitter suspended its accounts.\nLucien Greaves next to a nine-foot statue of the goat-headed idol Baphomet at the headquarters of the Satanic Temple in Salem, Massachusetts.

So far Twitter has not responded.\nMeanwhile, the @LaurieGatta1 account has been suspended, a search of Twitter determined.\nThe Massachusetts commission confirmed that the Satanic Temple filed a complaint against Twitter on March 12.\n\u201cOnce we complete our investigation we will be able to release the complaint and our findings,\u201d the agency's spokesman, H Harrison, told NBC News.\nThe Satanic Temple is less about devil worship and more of an advocate for strict separation of church and state. It opposes tax exemptions for religious organizations.\nIn years past, the group has gone to bat for women seeking abortion in Missouri, led the charge against Florida Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s push for voluntary prayers in public schools, and inserted itself into the battle over the Ten Commandments monument at the Oklahoma Capitol by insisting that the temple be allowed to place a statue of the goat-headed deity Baphomet near the Christian statue."}

There is anger among drivers that government is not intervening in raising their issues with Ola and Uber,\" Rathore said.\nHe said the association has called for the one-day strike in favour of the demands and if companies and government do not pay heed, they will go on an indefinite strike.\nAccording to the association, app-based cab companies made \"tall promises\" to drivers-- like they would earn as much as Rs 1.5 lakh every month.\n\"But the situation is different. They are making us run taxis at Rs 6 per km while they charge 25 per cent from us,\" Rathore also said.\nContrary to the association's claim that most autorickshaw and tourists associations have decided to lend their support to the strike, Delhi Autorickshaw Sangh and Delhi Pradesh Taxi Union (yellow-black taxis) said they will not participate in it.\n\"We will not support the strike in Delhi,\" Rajendra Soni, general secretary of both the associations, said.\nDuring the February strike, the Delhi-NCR commuters faced hardship as the companies had resorted to surge pricing during morning and evening peak hours."}

But it was also a lot harder than we ever imagined.\nHere's how it works:\nGuerrero runs Brady's \"TB12 Sports Therapy Center at Patriot Place\" and the pair are behind Brady's new book, \"The TB12 Method: How to Achieve a Lifetime of Sustained Peak Performance,\" a book that is being described \"the athletes' bible.\"\nREAD MORE: Tom Brady's first book is being described as 'The athletes' Bible' and is expected to outline Brady's formula for success\nWhile Gronk incorporated elements of Brady's strict diet, he was not quite to Brady's level. So no avocado ice cream yet.\nSource: Boston Herald\nOne twist to the regimen was that Brady does not drink alcohol, so they had to come up with a plan that would allow Gronk to keep drinking.\nThe alcohol diet is simple: For every alcoholic beverage, you have to drink at least three glasses of water \"to make up for cheating, to offset the ramifications.\"\nSource: Boston Herald\nWe decided to give the alcohol diet a shot over the course of a recent weekend. To make it more challenging, we did it over a football weekend when there is typically more social drinking happening.\nFirst we had to establish some rules. While a glass of water is typically defined as 8 ounces, it wasn't clear if Guerrero wanted each glass to be the same size as, say, a typical can of beer (12 ounces), or even a pint of beer (16 ounces). When multiplying by three over the course of a couple of days, that makes a big difference.\nWe have a SodaStream in our house that uses 33-ounce bottles. This seemed like a nice compromise between 24 ounces (3 glasses at 8 ounces each) and 36 ounces (3 glasses at 12 ounces each), while erring on the side of more. I simply drank one of these filled with water for every alcoholic beverage.\nThe only other rule was just \"no fudging\" on the alcohol. No oversized glasses of wine and no beer over 12 ounces. However, we figured things like IPAs, with higher alcohol content, and glasses of whisky, which are generally sipped over a longer period, were fair game.\nThe idea was to try to simulate a typical Gronk party weekend. I'm obviously not as big as Gronk (6-6, 265), but I am a healthy 6-2, 210 pounds and a former athlete. I already tend to drink a lot of water. I also have my Irish and Texas roots seemingly working in my favor, and often get chided by my friends for my high level of alcohol tolerance. This should be easy ... It wasn't.\nOn the first night, I decided to start off with Lagunitas IPA. I figured if I was going to have fewer drinks than a typical party weekend night while hanging out with some friends, I should up the alcohol content a tad. Lagunitas' IPA has an alcohol content of 6.2%, compared to 4% to 5% for most beers.\nAfter the first bottle of beer I made my first mistake and chugged the first bottle of water. Subconsciously, I think the water simply felt like an obstacle that needed to be overcome. The sooner it was out of the way, the sooner I could get back to the important stuff.\nOne beer in, and I already had to go to the bathroom. It was a good thing I tried this at home the first night. It would have been embarrassing running back and forth to the bathroom all night.\nI quickly realized that this wasn't just about staying hydrated and diluting the bad stuff. It also made me want less alcohol and even less food.\nI started drinking at 5 on Friday night. At 6:30 we ate pizza, and I could barely get down the second slice. By 7, I was already feeling bloated. I was just two beers into the diet.\nBy the third beer \u2014 and glasses 7, 8, and 9 of water \u2014 I already dreaded the idea of any more alcohol. But WWGD? He would keep pushing.\nAfter just three hours, I had already been to the bathroom three times. I had also decided (a little too late) that IPAs are a little too heavy for this. Then again, it was probably better than my second choice, Guinness Extra Stout. So I switched to a wheat ale, Yellow Armadillo from Thirsty Planet brewery.\nBy 9, four hours after starting my \"Gronk Binge,\" I had four beers and the equivalent of a dozen 11-ounce glasses of water. That was 16 drinks in four hours, and I felt awful. I was tempted to Google \"how much water is too much water?\" This might be healthier, and I might drink less alcohol and I might even eat less food, but I definitely felt worse than a typical night with a handful of drinks.\nBy 9:30 it was time to cut off the beer. I felt like I approached this the same way Gronk would, overconfident and with reckless abandon \u2014 \"I'm not going to be defeated by WATER!\" \u2014 so I switched to something I can sip and with a caffeine hit since I am now feeling sluggish: Bulleit whiskey and coke. Also, dessert was out of the question.\nBy 10:45, I had made it through 1.5 whiskey-cokes, and I was done. On a typical night out drinking with friends I would have had at least another hour, and maybe two, in me. Final tally from Day 1: 4 beers, 1.5 whiskey-cokes, the equivalent 15 11-ounce glasses of water, and I lost count of the number of trips to the bathroom.\nDay 2: I tried the diet again, on Saturday night. Even though there was a full slate of afternoon football games, I was still scarred from the night before and was not tempted to do any afternoon drinking.\nThe first mistake I made in Day 2 was starting with another IPA. I thought I could pace myself better. I did not. And sure enough, I once again chugged the first bottle of water.\nI was completely thrown off. While I thought I would learn from the mistakes of Day 1, instead my body just had no desire to drink anything. I quickly switched to whiskey-cokes. It didn't help.\nI found myself drinking the alcoholic drinks much slower as I tried to stall the next bottle of water, and the water itself became increasingly difficult to drink in large quantities. I just never fully comprehended ahead of time just how much water I would have to drink.\nFinal tally from Day 2: 1 beer, 2 whiskey-cokes, and the equivalent 9 11-ounce glasses of water. Definitely fewer than I would have had on a typical football Saturday.\nWhile I feel like Tom Brady and his fitness guru have \"defeated\" me, the goal now is to stick with this. Not only do I drink less on a typical drinking night, but I eat less, I consume more water, and I am simply more conscious of what is going into my body. All in all, that's a good thing.\nNow check out how Tom Brady lives his life off the field."}

Since then, as many as 2,558 applications have been received by the Garhwal range.\nData accessed from the police reveals that a total of 909 people have been arrested in the last three and a half years in such cases.\nIn the last three months of 2014, the SIT received 39 cases and in 2015, the number of applications were 474. This increased to 1,238 in 2016, and the next year there were 747 applications. In 2018, the SIT has already received 60 applications so far.\nIn regards to the number of arrests, 2016 had the most number of arrests with the figure being 625. This was followed by 213 arrests in 2015, and 71 in 2017. This year, police have arrested nearly 15 people in seven cases that were registered last year.\n\u201cThe need for the SIT was felt because the cops at the police station level were not equipped with adequate resources. Most of the land fraud cases are from Dehradun. The reason could be the city\u2019s growth in the recent years,\u201d said Pushpak Jyoti, DIG, Garhwal range.\nHe however added that there have been occasions when people file false complaints due to ill will. \u201cBefore investigating a case in detail, the SIT conducts a screening to ascertain veracity of the complaint. We don\u2019t entertain cases that are pending in civil courts,\u201d the DIG said.\nThe rise in the number of land fraud cases, especially in Dehradun, can be closely attributed to the growth of the city as a real estate hub in the last 18 years.\n\u201cDehradun suddenly became very important from the real estate point of view after it was declared the state capital. The land value rose exponentially, which in turn brought land sharks to the city,\u201d says Aloke B Lal, former director general of police, Uttarakhand. He adds that prior to 2000, people owned large swathes of land in Dehradun and they were not even bothered to erect boundaries and look after it.\n\u201cOver the last decade or so, ownership titles of many of these lands have been forged and fake wills prepared. There are also many lands which are owned by people but they have not come to Dehradun for years. So, over the years, land sharks occupied such plots. Furthermore, since the old land records are lying with the revenue authorities in Sahranpur, it became easier for people to float forged documents,\u201d he says.\nBut Dehradun is not alone in this.\nThe trend can also be seen in Rishikesh, Haridwar and Mussoorie says SS Pangtey, a former bureaucrat.\n\u201cMost of the big land frauds in Dehradun and Mussoorie pertain to lands that were once held by the inhabitants during the British era. To look after the properties, many of them formed trusts. But since over the time the members of the trust died and the trust too became defunct, there was no one to look after these plots. People with vested interests started claiming their ownership by forging documents and they could do so easily because there was no one alive to oppose them.\u201d\nHowever, not all applications filed before the SIT pertain to land frauds. Many involve disputes over demarcation, encroachments and violence. \u201cSuch cases are referred to the district administration and the SSPs concerned,\u201d the DIG said.\nOf all 2,558 applications that the SIT received, 230 were found to false and in 429, the parties arived at mutual consensus.\nFactfile\nYear Applications Arrested False cases Settled mutually\n2014 39 0 5 6\n2015 474 213 39 55\n2016 1,238 625 107 190\n2017 747 71 78 174\n2018 60 0 1 4\nTotal 2,558 909 230 439"}

SK Pendatun, and Sultan sa Barongis in the province of Maguindanao, as well as in the municipality of Pikit in the province of North Cotabato on 10 June 2018.\nThis incident was part of an ongoing operation by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) against the BIFF faction led by Esmail Abubakar (aka Commander Bungos), whose group had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State (ISIS).\nThe operation was coordinated with the MILF ceasefire panel. However, due to time constraints, no pre-emptive evacuation was organized.\nA BIFF bomb factory in the southern parts of Liguasan Marsh was reportedly destroyed as a result of this operation. In addition, 15 members of the BIFF faction were killed and 8 were wounded, according to reports. This information was, however, denied by the leadership of the BIFF.\nResidents of these areas who were, at that time, taking their preobservance of the Islamic month of Ramadhan were forced to evacuate to safer locations.\nCURRENT SITUATION\nBased on the most recent report provided by the Provincial Social Welfare and Development Office of Maguindanao as of 19 June 2018, 5,136 families (23,465 individuals) have been displaced.\nMost of the displaced are staying with host families, while the rest have settled in designated evacuation sites, such as schools, gyms, and in other community structures. IDPs who are home-based, particularly those in the remote areas, are at risk of being excluded from registration processes.\nThe government of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) through the ARMM Humanitarian Emergency Action Response Team (ARMM-HEART), DSWD ARMM, and DSWD Region XII are presently working in close coordination with the Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Councils of the affected municipalities within their respective jurisdiction, which have conducted assessments to different displacement sites, to address the displacement.\nThe displaced population perceive that their displacement may take longer than expected. They have expressed that they will not return until Government troops have pulled out from the area, because they fear that they may be caught in the crossfire.\nAn undetermined number of civilians residing in the area known as the Salbu, Pagatin, Mamasapano and Shariff Aguak (SPMS) Box and in neighboring towns have also pre-emptively evacuated to nearby villages because of fear of a possible escalation of conflict in their areas, triggered by the increasing presence of the military.\nThere is an advice from the authorities that the IDPs can safely return to their respective residences. However, IDPs have chosen to stay away from their places of origin because of the continued military operations. There are evacuation centers that are vacated, but only because the IDPs have just transferred to other temporary displacement locations."}

Neon glows from a pair of dive bars. Figures are silhouetted waiting outside a restaurant and a lone woman makes dragon beard candy in a tiny storefront window. All are nighttime scenes along Grant Ave. in San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown.\nThe avenue, which runs north and south, is one of the oldest streets in the city. In the late 1800s, it became home to Chinese immigrants who were fleeing unrest at home, seeking opportunity here or following the Gold Rush. Many of the neighbourhood\u2019s buildings today can be traced to reconstruction efforts after the 1906 earthquake.\nGrant Ave. is a bustling street during the day, often filled with tourists in search of souvenirs or locals shopping for food. But at night the street is quiet, allowing for leisurely strolling and new discoveries. Many stores close early with only a few bars, restaurants and bakeries open late. It\u2019s an interesting place to stroll this time of year and reflect on the area\u2019s culture and history as Lunar New Year approaches, Feb. 16, launching the year of the dog.\nAt the intersection of Grant Ave. and Washington St. are a pair of dive bars located 10 steps away from each other. One is the Li Po Cocktail Lounge, named for a poet in China\u2019s Tang Dynasty, dating to the 1930s. Inside its red lacquered doors sits a golden Buddha statue behind a wraparound bar. The Li Po is known for its $9 (U.S.) Chinese Mai Tai made with three rums, pineapple juice and a \u201cChinese Liqueur\u201d served in a plastic hurricane glass and packing a wallop to the unsuspecting. Nearby is the Buddha Lounge, a dinky, quirky dive known for betting on your drink in a game of Liar\u2019s Dice between you and the bartender.\nWhere Grant Ave. meets Broadway St. near the North Beach district is China Live, which opened last year and serves as an anchor point for the revitalization effort within the greater Chinatown neighbourhood. The four-storey building is a culinary and cultural landmark. It includes multiple restaurants, bars, a retail market and an event space.

It managed to crawl off a low of 98.858 hit earlier this week, its weakest level since Nov. 11, in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump's failed healthcare bill.\nData on Tuesday showed the U.S. consumer confidence index at its highest level since December 2000, pushing up U.S. Treasury yields and providing support for the greenback.\nCity Index research director Kathleen Brooks, in London, said the dollar's strength was down to a mixture of Fed expectations, the stronger U.S. data, and hopes that Trump would now focus on tax reform.\n\"The continuing strength of the U.S. economic data is obviously a key driver,\" said Brooks. \"We're also seeing the positive correlation between the stock market and the dollar reinstated. So as the stock market recovers, that's obviously good news for the dollar as well.\"\n\"By and large the market is giving Trump a second chance, and we think there's a Trump premium in the market,\" she added.\nTrump's healthcare reform defeat at the end of last week raised doubts about his ability to carry out his fiscal stimulus and tax cuts, and pushed the dollar to 110.11 yen on Monday, its lowest since Nov. 18.\nIt has since recovered almost 1 percent but was still lower 0.2 percent at 110.96 yen on Wednesday.\n\"(The dollar's strength) is probably more a function of the very strong U.S. consumer confidence numbers we saw yesterday and the somewhat more hawkish noises we've seen emanating from the Fed,\" said Alvin Tan, currency strategist at Societe Generale in London.\nU.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said in a television interview on Tuesday that two more increases to U.S. overnight interest rates this year seemed \"about right\".\nThe Fed raised rates in March, and a majority of the central bank's policymakers foresee at least two more increases this year.\nBut Fed Governor Jerome Powell said on Tuesday that the collapse of the healthcare bill had made the U.S. central bank's job harder as it tried to anticipate which set of policies would pass.\nSterling steadied at $1.2452 as investors focused on Britain's formal request to leave the European Union.\nThe euro was down 0.2 percent on the day at $1.0792.\nFor Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets see reuters:\/\/realtime\/verb=Open\/url=http:\/\/emea1.apps.cp.extranet.thomsonreuters.biz\/cms\/?pageId=livemarkets (additional reporting by Tokyo markets team; Editing by Jermey Gaunt)"}

Some junior programmes are starting to show positive results and with cuts in funding, we may have to downsize.\n\"We have restricted several of our contracts to end on March 31, 2017 as we do not want to commit to any spending until we are sure of our budget.\"\nThe SHF has hosted various international events in the last few years, including last year's Women's Asian Champions Trophy that featured top sides India, Japan and Korea.\nBut Singapore will see no top-level hockey action in the next two years, at least.\nLee is also fearful of the repercussions if there is a significant cut.\nBut, she said: \"This will affect everybody. We can't work in a way that our elite programme doesn't face cuts but others suffer.\n\"We will see impact from the elite to the grassroots, and from athletes to (administrative) staff. Our programmes will be affected too, but we will try as much as possible to mitigate the impact.\n\"We will just have to dig into our reserves in order to continue programmes that are necessary to promote the game, and sustain interest.\"\nTo cope with the reduced funding, the STTA is planning fund-raising events, Lee added."}

The latter due to his preferred style and methods, the former due to his perceived lack of quality despite success at Barcelona (how hard could that be, they say).\nA potential candidate who not only ticks the \u201cattacking football\u201d checkbox but is also someone who grafted his way up the ranks towards greatness, proving himself at every station from non-league to Champions League (well, okay, not that part yet) is Maurizio Sarri, who has made Napoli into the neutral's favorite once again after doing away with the Rafaluzione back in 2015. His up-tempo, quick-passing, possession-based and attack-oriented style is the style that most people love.\nOne of those people, if recent reports are to be believed is Roman Abramovich, and the Chelsea owner is apparently keeping a close eye on the 59-year-old's contract situation down in Naples \u2014 Sarri may be a new kid on the European block, but he's no spring chicken.\nAnd that contract situation is certainly worth keeping an eye on if any club would want to entice Sarri away from Napoli, as starting yesterday, an \u20ac8m buyout clause is active through May 31st. While Napoli owner Aurelio Di Laurentiis has made it clear that he wants to renegotiate the contract and remove the clause \u201cimmediately\u201d (and, presumably give a payrise, too), for now, the buyout is there and ready to be activated.\nIf that sounds to you like a story planted by an agent in today's Gazzetta dello Sport , you're probably not wrong. But whatever the origin of the rumor, the basic fact of the buyout seems to be anything but fake. So if Chelsea are indeed serious about replacing Conte, as the narrative wants us to believe, a potentially ideal replacement is just \u20ac8m away."}

Rice said the only time his daughter has a completely seizure free day is when he takes her to Colorado, where marijuana is legal, and gives her cannabis twice a day.\n\"Epilepsy is a deadly disease,\" he said. \"Every seizure takes away a little bit of her brain.\"\nLawmakers and advocates have pushed for the drug to be declassified and grouped with such drugs as cocaine and opiates, which have medical uses but are still illegal for recreational use.\nThe change could make it easier to study and prescribe marijuana, but the Obama administration decided against it last year.\nResearchers now have to file applications with multiple federal agencies before they can request cannabis products from a university in Mississippi that remains the country's sole source of pot for federally approved research.\nEthan Russo, medical director at the clinical research organization Phytecs, is working on a Johns Hopkins University research project on how components of cannabis impact mood and memory. He said the research team submitted the proposal about a year ago and is still working to get funding approval from the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\nSo far, there are a handful of projects being considered at the University of Utah, including how cannabidiol impacts people who have autism and anxiety and its effect on post-traumatic stress disorder.

Three battleground districts in Orange County \u2014 a one-time conservative bastion that backed Hillary Clinton in 2016 \u2014 all pose the same risk in next Tuesday\u2019s primaries, which could cost Democrats some of their most promising opportunities to flip seats in their bid to retake the House of Representatives this fall. \u2026\n\u201cSeeing the risk, the DCCC has intervened \u2014 to varying degrees \u2014 in all three races, though it has never been more difficult for political parties to steer the outcome of primaries.

Really, a lot. But every once in a while he will come out guns blazing in defense of the truth, demanding corrections and consequences for spreading falsehoods told by others, and using incorrect news reports to undercut the media as a whole. He executed the well-practiced maneuver once again on Tuesday, seizing on images of detained migrant children in bare-bones holding areas that had been spread on Twitter to attack his immigration policies but turned out to have been taken in 2014 while President Barack Obama was still in office. \u2026 This kind of rhetoric is emerging as a central element of his 2018 and 2020 campaign strategies. Republican strategists, including officials behind Trump's reelection effort, are operating under the premise that Democrats will be plenty energized for the midterms and 2020 elections \u2014 and they largely see their job as helping the GOP match, or exceed, that energy.\u201d Full story.\nTREND WATCH \u2014 \u201cStacey Abrams Didn\u2019t Play It Safe.

If confronted, which wasn\u2019t often, there were three responses \u2013 defensiveness, denial and making my thin skin the issue; silence and a change in our relationship; and acknowledgment and understanding.\nI have not always known what to do.\nMost of the time, I chose to pretend I didn\u2019t hear, that I didn\u2019t care and that it didn\u2019t undermine my confidence.\nAs I age, the type of harassment I experience has changed too. It\u2019s still gender-based, but it\u2019s less sexual.\nI\u2019ve learned it doesn\u2019t pay to pretend; so, for the most part, I let people know that I hear them, that I understand the inference, and that I see their words for what they\u2019re meant to be \u2014 humiliating, belittling and ignorant.\nAs I listened to the debate the erupted afterward, I thought of the young reporter, Charlotte Observer beat reporter Jourdan Rodrigue.\nI\u2019ve been in her shoes.\nThat uncomfortable silence that followed Newton\u2019s remark, I\u2019ve felt its weight. I\u2019ve been publicly humiliated for no other reason than because I was a woman trying to do my job. I\u2019ve had to defend myself in a fight I never wanted.\nI grappled with who is worth confronting, how to address issues in the least confrontational way possible, and I\u2019ve debated whether it was even worth the trouble that would certainly be mine if I dared mention the problem.\nAfter she tweeted about the incident, Rodrigue became the target of people who would rather dismiss a sexist remark than ask why attitudes like this are toxic to any environment.\nThey highlighted inappropriate and racist tweets she shared several years ago. The preceded her working at the Charlotte Observer, and they had nothing to do with Newton or the issue of sexual harassment, but they allowed people to dismiss an uncomfortable issue.\nThose tweets allowed people to skip conversations that might benefit all of us.\nMake no mistake about it, those who brought up the tweets did so in an effort to bully her into submission. And let that be a message to any other woman who might dare address an inequity.\nThey not-so-subtly dismissed his offense by creating outrage over hers.\nWhy don\u2019t an estimated 75 percent of sexual assault victims come forward? Why don\u2019t domestic violence victims seek help? Why don\u2019t women pursue discipline against co-workers or bosses for sexual harassment? This is why. Because if you do, be prepared to defend what you do, who you do it with, what you wear and every choice you\u2019ve ever made whether it has anything to do with what happened to you or not. And heaven help you if you\u2019re not the kind of victim that society sees as worthy of our outrage.\nSexual harassment is more than inappropriate jokes or women who can\u2019t take compliments. It\u2019s demeaning, demoralizing and a destructive force to both a work environment and individual human beings. You do not have to be the target, to suffer.\nAny environment is made better with variety. Whether you\u2019re talking about nature, a recipe or a business, diverse and unique individual elements create a much more viable, delicious and interesting unit. Add women to your workplace and you may not be able to tell those dirty jokes, but I\u2019ll let you in on a secret. Those were already creating toxicity that carried into other parts of your life. A diverse workforce is as beneficial to us as human beings as it is to a company\u2019s success.\nAs I listened to Cam Newton\u2019s apology for those sexist comments, I thought of his young daughters.\nI thought of how it feels to idolize someone who doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s sending you mixed messages.\nIf Clint Eastwood had a twin, it would be my dad. From the terrifying stare to the conservative politics to the aversion to conformity, my dad is some combination of every character Eastwood has ever played.\nA Vietnam veteran and retired Alaska State Trooper, my dad has always been a human contradiction.\nOn one hand, he convinced me I could do anything I wanted to do. In fact, his dreams for me were much bigger than my own. To say he encouraged me to chase my dreams would be trivializing the relentless support he\u2019s been in my life.\nBut he was also the first person I battled with over gender stereotypes. He didn\u2019t think women belonged in combat and said when he first became a police officer, he said he\u2019d refuse to work with a female officer, joking that, she might \u201cfall down and shoot me in the back\u201d under the pressure and chaos of the job.\nAt the same time, he taught me to defend myself, helped me recognize dangerous situations and discussed ways I could avoid, escape or survive those worst-case scenarios that frame a woman\u2019s reality. He reveled in my unorthodox choices and celebrated my independence.\nBut it wasn\u2019t my well-thought-out arguments that ever persuaded him to change his opinion of female police officers or soldiers. It was the tough, capable women he worked alongside.\nIt wasn\u2019t long before he was talking about how they were the most reliable backups and the most capable investigators. They did what his affection for me could not.\nHis perception shifted even more deeply when my confrontation-avoiding younger sister followed him into the profession. He painfully experienced, through her, just how insidious those gender stereotypes are to tough, capable women.\nNewton\u2019s apology was, in my opinion, more sincere than most. Yeah, he didn\u2019t offer the video apology until after he lost sponsors, but sometimes it takes something painful to wake us up to a blind spot.\nWe all have biases.\nI\u2019ve been called out on mine. Instead of jumping in my bunker, I\u2019ve sought to learn and evolve. I\u2019ve even had to ask for forgiveness. Good and intelligent people have biases and even prejudices. I assert that most men don\u2019t understand how demeaning, debilitating and demoralizing sexual harassment or gender bias is, especially in professions almost exclusively male.\nMy advice is to take Newton, and men like him, at their word. He said he didn\u2019t intend to belittle or offend, and I\u2019m willing to accept that. My advice to him is that if you love those little girls and want a world of endless possibilities for them like I think you do, then find some tough, capable women with whom you can address this issue in a real and on-going way.\nAnd if you\u2019re a man who thinks having daughters or loving a woman or respecting your mom makes you less sexist, I promise you that it does not. You can have, and even share toxic gender stereotypes while holding the hand of that little girl who thinks you might actually be the real Superman.\nSo if you aren\u2019t moved to gain insight and understanding into this issue for yourself or the women who work with you, then maybe do it for her.\nBecause someday, she\u2019s going to run into a man who grew up saturated in the ideas you propagated.\nAnd she\u2019ll have to live and love and be excellent in a world your behavior helped create."}

The psychologically important number sent ripples across financial markets because rising interest rates are a sea change for consumers and companies that have lived with ultra-low borrowing costs for the past decade.\nAlong with interest rates, other costs are rising for companies, with the potential to bite into profits and dampen earnings growth.\nThis earnings season, with double digit growth, was expected to pump up stock prices and take investors' minds off of trade wars and geopolitical concerns. But strong earnings may have opened the door to a new concern \u2014 commodities and labor costs are going up along with interest rates.\n\"The reaction to earnings has been lackluster even though we are reporting great numbers,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR. But Hogan said companies are talking about a new issue, and some of it may be a result of tariffs and threats of tariffs. \"We are clearly hearing caution about input costs, whether they be wages, commodity based, interest rates, whatever. All of that comes with no economic benefit,\" he said.\nCaterpillar was a case in point. Shares of the industrial equipment maker soared in early trading Tuesday on good earnings, but swooned later in the day and fell 6 percent lower after CFO Bradley Halverson told investors that the first quarter was likely the \"high watermark\" for the year. Operating margins will be strong but not as strong in the next few quarters.\nIn a slide presentation, the company said it sees pricing improvement, but that is partially offset by higher material costs.\nThe big technology stocks known as FANG were also crushed on Tuesday, with Alphabet leading the sell off. The parent of Google was slammed after analysts warned it could be less profitable because of increased spending.\nOverall, stocks fell sharply, with the Dow down 424 pints at 24,024. The S&P 500 fell 1.3 percent to 2,634, and the Nasdaq was off 1.7 percent, at 7,007.\nLori Calvasina, RBC's chief U.S. equities strategist, said margins were so much a concern that earlier this month she cut her S&P 500 target for year end to 2,890 from 3,000. She now expects margins will be flat this year, not as expansive as she previously thought. She cut earnings per share expectations for the S&P 500 to $151 from $155.\n\"The market can still go up, just not as much as we thought at the beginning of the year,\" she said. \"We think people need to temper their enthusiasm a little bit.\"\nShe added that she got concerned about the effect of higher wages, which she heard companies discussing on fourth quarter earnings conference calls.\n\"I still like the market on a six- to 12-month view. We still like the market from here,\" she said, adding it could continue to hop around.\nThe other issue hanging over the market is the fear that inflation will push the Fed to hike interest rates more than the two remaining hikes it now forecasts for this year. A rising 10\u2013year yield affects rates across a broad spectrum of consumer and business loans, even though 3 percent is still low by long-term standards.\n\"I don't know why the 3 percent on the 10-year freaks people out so much but it is certainly something the market got in its head,\" Calvasina said. \"3 percent should not be the point of pain but it's something I hear from investors.\" The 10-year briefly touched 3 percent Tuesday morning before drifting slightly lower.\nThe 10-year is the benchmark U.S. sovereign, the most influential in the world, and in the U.S. it is the yield that is most closely tied to home mortgages. Overall, Treasury yields also influence rates on the $26 trillion in U.S. corporate, municipal, mortgage and agency debt outstanding, according to SIFMA data.\n\"I think it woke up the equity geeks and now they're worried about an accelerating Fed, and that's scaring the market,\" said Andrew Brenner of National Alliance. As the 10-year touched 3 percent and backed off Tuesday, the difference in rates on investment grade bonds and high yield corporate debt was barely changed.\nThere are a number of ways higher rates can interfere with stock market gains. Besides making borrowing more expensive, rising interest rates could slow down the record amounts of corporate debt being used to fund stock buybacks. Higher borrowing costs can also make some projects less financially feasible, and that can ultimately slow down the economy as interest rates keep rising.\nHigher rates could also make bonds a more enticing investment than stocks, especially for pension funds and foreign institutions.\n\"I think everyone can accept the idea that most rates are linked to Treasurys in one way or the other. What this means from a macro standpoint is the cost of money is getting much more expensive for a society that's very levered and a country that's very levered. Our cost of doing business is going to get more onerous,\" said George Goncalves, head of rate strategy at Nomura.\nRalph Axel, director of U.S. interest rate strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said corporate debt issuance is down about 4.8 percent this year as yields have moved higher. Also down are the amount of mortgage debt being issued, with $411 billion issued through March, $50 billion less than the same time last year.\n\"There's a very big debate whether we have more room to run in the expansion, and higher rates and inflation and higher growth, or is this going to be the time to buy? Is there going to be a wall of money that comes in when we get to 3 percent to take the other side,\" he said. Bond yields move opposite price, and yields rise when investors are selling.\nAxel said he expects the 10-year to reach 3.25 percent by the end of the year, and that's a level where some strategists see stocks running into trouble.\n\"There's no doubt it's going to bring in some buyers [into bonds]. It's an interesting number to say 3 versus 2.99 but its still very low. The issue here is rates are extremely low by longer term historical standards,\" said Axel."}

By the time security forces reclaimed the restaurant around dawn Monday, at least 18 people had been killed and eight others wounded, according to local authorities.\nThe West African nation's communications minister, Remis Dandjinou, told reporters Monday that by daybreak, two of the attackers had been killed and several foreign nationals were among the dead. In separate statements, officials in Paris and Ankara confirmed the victims include a French citizen and Turkish citizen, while another Turk was injured in the violence.\nWhile Burkinabe officials blamed Islamist militants for the attack on the Turkish cafe, no one group immediately claimed responsibility.\n\"I salute the bravery of our security and defense forces whose engagement allowed us to neutralize the terrorists,\" Burkinabe President Roch Marc Christian Kabore said in a statement, as translated by CNN.\n\"The struggle against terrorism is a lengthy fight,\" he added. \"That is why I am calling for vigilance, solidarity and unity of the whole nation to face up to the cowardice of our enemies.\"\nIn a news conference Monday, Dandjinou detailed the night's bloody events, which opened when he says about three to four militants rolled up to the cafe on motorcycles around 9 p.m. local time. They opened fire on an outside seating area outside then moved indoors, where The New York Times notes a family had been celebrating a 9-year-old boy's birthday.\nThe newspaper reports the boy was hospitalized with injuries from the attack.\nFor Burkinabes, the attack on Aziz Istanbul cafe, which is popular with foreigners, prompts bitter memories of another bloody episode just over 18 months ago. In January last year, militants conducted an hours-long raid on a luxury hotel and a cafe just blocks away from Aziz Istanbul, ultimately killing some 30 people before being dislodged by security forces.\nAl-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, a militant group based in the region, claimed responsibility for that attack \u2014 as well as another deadly assault just months before in neighboring Mali.\nIslamist groups have been active for years in the Sahel region, which includes Mali and Burkina Faso. As groups linked to al-Qaida have carried out attacks in the area, the Times points out that the United Nations peacekeeping mission to Mali \"has become one of the most dangerous in the world.\"\nThe French government \u2014 which controlled Burkina Faso, then called Upper Volta, as a colony until 1960 \u2014 says President Emmanuel Macron met with Kabore on Monday to discuss the circumstances of the latest attack.\nThe pair of leaders also reaffirmed their commitment to the formation of an international security force in the Sahel region to \"continue the fight against terrorist groups.\""}

The Penguins will open the Calder Cup playoffs tonight in Charlotte, N.C. TIMES-SHAMROCK FILE Wilkes-Barre\/Scranton Penguins players celebrate a goal by Daniel Sprong (11) against Hershey earlier this month. Sprong, one of the AHL\u2019s top goal scorers, and the Penguins will open the Calder Cup playoffs against the Charlotte Checkers tonight in Charlotte, N.C.\nDefense wins championships, or does it?\nIn hockey, playoff games have an almost gladiatorial reputation. With the increased physicality, glory goes to players who gut their way through broken bones, ligament tears and a host of other painful ailments more so than score goals.\nGoaltenders, meanwhile, can become legends for one shutout or dominant performance that completely shifts a series.\nBut can teams make a run at the Calder Cup without a potent offensive attack? The evidence emphatically says otherwise.\nFourteen teams that qualified for the playoffs this season ranked in the top half of the league in total goals. The only major exception was the San Jose Barracuda, who played eight fewer games than most teams and finished last in scoring.\nNo first-round matchup better illustrates the importance of goal-scoring than the Wilkes-Barre\/Scranton Penguins\u2019 clash with the Charlotte Checkers. Both teams are considered major contenders based, in large part, on their fifth- and first-ranked offenses, respectively.\n\u201c(The Checkers) seem to be more of a skill team,\u201d Penguins forward Jean Sebastien Dea said. \u201cSo, I think it\u2019s going to be important to bring some physicality in this series. It\u2019s going to be very important to bring speed and be good on the forecheck, create some turnovers, and score on some of their mistakes.\u201d\nOn paper, the teams are evenly matched in a couple ways. Both have one of the league\u2019s premier goal scorers \u2014 Charlotte\u2019s Valentin Zykov and the Penguins\u2019 Daniel Sprong.\nBoth make a living off depth scoring \u2014 the Checkers have seven skaters with 15 or more goals, and Wilkes-Barre\/Scranton counters with six.\nAnd both are elite in one key style of play \u2014 Charlotte on the man-advantage, and the Penguins even strength.\nIt could make for an entertaining opening series, but it also bodes well for making a deep postseason run. Nine of the last 10 league finalists had an offense that ranked eighth or better during the regular season. Six were in the top five.\nSo, it\u2019s fairly obvious the key to advancing for teams is not so much being able to completely shut down opponents, but limiting them just enough with hustle plays and grit to match each offensive blow.\n\u201cI think we had a good offensive team last year,\u201d forward Teddy Blueger said. \u201cWe obviously added some good players and lost some good players. (Our offense) is one of our strengths this year, especially 5-on-5.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to come down to Xs and Os as much as battling and character and competing.\u201d\nMeaning that\u2019s where other factors, like a red-hot goaltender or even a questionable penalty call, can come in to play.\nSo does defense win championships? To say it has lost all relevance anymore is simply not true, and that could be what puts the Penguins\u2019 greater goal of winning a championship in serious jeopardy.\nThe past four Calder Cup Finals were won by teams that ranked seventh or better in goals allowed. Wilkes-Barre\/Scranton ranked 19th in that category this season.\nThe good news is the team is massive on the blue line and has two goaltenders with plenty of NHL experience. In a seven-game series, those factors alone could pay huge dividends.\nBut with the opening matchup only going five games at most, the urgency is there for Wilkes-Barre\/Scranton to play as responsibly as possible and make sure the Checkers offense doesn\u2019t start clicking.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to get into a track meet with them,\u201d head coach Clark\nDonatelli said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how we play. Our game is our O-zone structure. That\u2019s their style. They like to giddy up and go.\nHopefully, we\u2019re not getting into games like that.\u201d\nContact the writer:\ntpiccotti@citizensvoice.com;\n570-821-2089;\n@CVPiccotti on Twitter"}

The island's economy was already in deep crisis before the hurricane hit, and advocates argue that since the debt was caused by bad and often rapacious policy choices on the mainland, erasing it is the right thing to do. But skeptics say simply wiping out the debt would have complicated financial consequences. Should Puerto Rico's debt be forgiven?\nPERSPECTIVES\nPresident Donald Trump roiled the markets on Oct. 3 by saying Puerto Rico's debt should be wiped out:\n\"We have to look at their whole debt structure,\" he said Tuesday evening on Fox News's Hannity. \"You know, they owe a lot of money to your friends on Wall Street, and we're going to have to wipe that out. You can say goodbye to that. I don't know if it's Goldman Sachs, but whoever it is, you can wave goodbye to that.\"\nMORE: Trump is right -- we need to forgive Puerto Rico's debt\nBut Director of the Office of Management and Budget Mick Mulvaney quickly contradicted Trump's statement:\n\"I think what you heard the president say is that Puerto Rico is going to have to figure out a way to solve its debt problem,\" he told Bloomberg News. \"We are not going to bail them out. We are not going to pay off those debts. We are not going to bail out those bond holders.\"\nCritics argue that since U.S. policies like the Jones Act are what landed the territory in a financial crisis in the first place, the least we can do is wipe the slate clean and give them a fresh start -- especially after they've suffered $95 billion in hurricane-related damage.\nThanks to the law, the price of goods from the United States mainland is at least double that in neighboring islands, including the United States Virgin Islands, which are not covered by the Jones Act. Moreover, the cost of living in Puerto Rico is 13 percent higher than in 325 urban areas elsewhere in the United States, even though per capita income in Puerto Rico is about $18,000, close to half that of Mississippi, the poorest of all 50 states.\nThis is a shakedown, a mob protection racket, with Puerto Rico a captive market.\nNobody was talking about debt in Puerto Rico in 1898 when the US snatched it up hoping to make a killing in the sugar markets. -- jelani cobb (@jelani9) October 3, 2017\nBut others say Puerto Rico got itself into this crisis, and they need to get themselves out of it.\nYea PR is done. They borrowed too much like socialists normally do. Don't expect us to pay it back. -- Eleonore Bucher (@EleonoreBucher) October 4, 2017\nAnd while most people would be happy to see Wall Street hedge funds lose in a Puerto Rican debt forgiveness agreement, three quarters of the island's debt is owned by individuals and mutual funds that are held by mom-and-pop investors. Just wiping away that debt could create its own financial problems.\n\"For the most part, Main Street America owns this debt,\" Long said. \"It's not as though these are vultures circling around the island.\"\nThe Tylt is focused on debates and conversations around news, current events and pop culture.

Throughout the centuries, indigenous communities have endured much turmoil, from the Spanish conquest to a 36-year civil war that resulted in more than 200,000 deaths where more than 80 percent of those were Mayan, according to a U.N.\u2013based report.\nBut what's remarkable is that despite violence and death, these communities' ancient practices have prevailed.\nA visually stunning new book details one of the Maya's most enduring traditions, their healers.\n\u201cI was privileged to be allowed to photograph the healings, to listen to their stories and dreams, and to enter the forest with them to photograph Maya ceremonies performed at sacred sites,\" said award-winning photographer Fran Antmann, author of the recently published \"Maya Healers: A Thousand Dreams.\"\nPedro Mendoza tries to walk again with the help of his mother and brother. After a work-related accident, Pedro's broken leg was healed over several weeks by healer and bonesetter Berta Navichoc. Fran Antmann\nAntmann, who is known internationally for her several books and photography collections, said she chose the word \"dreams\" in the title not just because it\u2019s poetic, but because it's a big part of understanding their centuries-old practices.\n\u201cThe healers (curanderos) are said to derive their power and knowledge from dreams,\u201d she said. \u201cThe healers are believed to have connections with the supernatural.\u201d\nAntmann focused her research in a village called San Pedro La Laguna on the shores of Lake Atitl\u00e1n.\nIn rural parts of Guatemala, medical care is usually expensive and geographically inaccessible. Spanish is also sometimes a foreign language to the indigenous population, and many feel disdain from doctors. This explains, Antmann said, why it is more comforting for members of some indigenous communities to go to their local healer.\nHealers are determined at birth, and it is believed that individuals are born with this \u201cdon,\u201d or gift. It\u2019s considered a sacred profession, and one decides to accept it or not. They don\u2019t go to medical school, nor do they get paid.\nHealers who use objects to realign the bones, and then their hands to finish the treatment are called \u201chueseros\u201d or \u201cbonesetters.\u201d They feel like they don\u2019t even guide their hands to heal, explains Antmann, their hands guide them.\nHealer, bonesetter and midwife Josefina Vasquez, photographed by Fran Antmann during a healing. Fran Antmann\n\u201cThe bonesetters often describe how they found through dreams the sacred bones they use for healing,\u201d said Antmann. \u201cFor the Maya, the place and role of dreams is ingrained in their culture.\u201d\nAntmann was impressed by the faith of the patient and the healer.\n\u201cThe healing takes place where the patient lives, or sometimes in their sacred Maya spaces,\u201d said Antmann. \u201cThe whole family is involved \u2013 it\u2019s a communal affair. Family members are praying in the adjacent room, and their participation is integral in the healing process.\u201d\nFran Antmann's book \"Maya Healers\" Nirala Publications\nThe Maya's rich traditions has survived much upheaval and violence since the arrival of the Spanish in the fifteenth century.\nFor Antmann, who was born in the Bronx, New York to German and Austrian Holocaust survivors, it's been a privilege to be able to witness the Mayan way of life.\n\u201cI feel an umbilical cord to Guatemala,\u201dAntmann said, adding that her adoptive daughter is from San Pedro.\nAs a Fulbright scholar, she spent 1979 through 1981 in the Peruvian Andes recovering the work of the late acclaimed but forgotten photographer Sebastian Rodriguez. A current professor at Baruch College in NYC, she spent the past 12 summers in Guatemala. Though she has recently focused on Guatemala, she has devoted much of her award-winning photography to documenting the people and places of Mexico and Peru.\nA view of Lake Atitlan, which as Antmann explains in her book, is threatened by pollution and overpopulation. Fran Antmann\n\u201cWhat is most significant to me is the way I was accepted into this community, and how I gradually gained access to and built a bridge of trust to the families and natural healers,\u201d said Antmann.\nAnother important part of this long trajectory was the experience of going back to San Pedro with the book in hand, sharing it with the healers, and seeing how much it meant to them,\" she said. \"I can't think of anything more gratifying for a photographer working in another culture.\u201d\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM."}

Four players on defense are out, while three key players on offense are questionable. This leaves the 49ers with a challenge for both game planning and execution for a matchup that favors them on paper.\nThe Colts are 1-3 with their only victory coming at home against the 0-4 Cleveland Browns in Week 2. Indy lost on the road to the Los Angeles Rams in Week 1 by 37 points and then lost on the road to the Seattle Seahawks in Week 4 by 28 points. Meanwhile, the 49ers have losses against the Rams and the Seahawks themselves\u2014but only by a combined five points.\nDefense hurting but still playing well\nDespite the fact that safety Adrian Colbert (hamstring), linebacker Reuben Foster (ankle), safety Eric Reid (knee) and linebacker Dekoda Watson (groin) didn\u2019t practice this week and are not expected to play on Sunday, the 49ers have some confidence on the defensive side of the ball. The S.F. defense is ranked 19th in total defense right now, which is much better than the dead-last finish last season. The fact the 49ers have done this without their best lineup is impressive, as Foster and Reid are starters. Watson is a pass-rush specialist who registered seven sacks last season for the Denver Broncos, so his presence is missed, too.\nDynamic players on offense may be limited on Sunday\nOn the other side of the ball, three players that are integral to Head Coach Kyle Shanahan\u2019s offense are dinged up and questionable. The worst of it is at running back, where both starter Carlos Hyde (hip) and primary backup Matt Breida (ankle) were limited this week in workouts. That can affect Shanahan\u2019s playcalling, but it also means the 49ers are dangerously thin at the position if both players suffer any aggravation to their current injury problems\u2014either before the game or during it.\nIn the vertical passing game, wide receiver Marquise Goodwin is in the league\u2019s concussion protocol, so he needs to be cleared to play on Sunday in Indianapolis. He, too, was limited in practice on both Wednesday and Thursday, and it\u2019s unknown right now whether or not Goodwin will be active for Week 5.\nColts are battered and bruised, too\nWith a whopping 14 players listed on their injury report, Indy is not in good shape itself. Of course, the biggest news is that quarterback Andrew Luck, who starred at Stanford during his college days, is out until next month for the Colts as he recovers from labrum surgery. But beyond Luck\u2019s status, five other players did not practice on Thursday for Indy, including RB Frank Gore, the 49ers all-time leading rusher. Gore is expected to play on Sunday, however.\nQuestionable:\n(RB) Matt Breida (Ankle) \u2014 Limited Participation in Practice\n(WR) Marquise Goodwin (Concussion) \u2014 Limited Participation in Practice\n(RB) Carlos Hyde (Hip) \u2014 Limited Participation in Practice\nOut:"}

As part of the agreement, Grand Junction's 13 employees will relocate a few blocks to Target's downtown San Francisco office and set about helping the retailer bring delivery to more areas.\nThe same-day service will expand to other New York City stores by October and to additional U.S. cities early next year, Valdez said. Target and Wal-Mart are playing catch-up with Amazon's Prime service, which already lets members in about 30 metropolitan areas receive orders in as little as an hour. Four out of five shoppers want same-day shipping, according to a survey by fulfillment software maker Temando, but only half of retailers offer it.\n\"There's clearly an arms race going on from the mass merchants, recognizing that getting everyday essentials in the hands of customers is critical,\" Michael Lasser, an analyst at UBS Group AG, said in a note. \"The purchase of Grand Junction should help Target compete on these terms in a more economical fashion.\"\nValdez and Grand Junction Chief Executive Officer Rob Howard -- who first met when Valdez worked at Amazon and Howard ran another logistics company -- spent about three months putting together the deal.\nMerging with Target will force Grand Junction to close out its work for other retailers like Office Depot Inc. and CVS Health Corp. Howard said he's not worried about the lost business, as \"the pie in local delivery is getting larger.\"\nFounded in 2014, Grand Junction coordinates about 6 million local deliveries a month, about double the volume it handled two years ago. Howard wouldn't disclose its revenue, but he said the business is profitable.\nThe acquisition is Target's second investment in e-commerce this year, after plowing $75 million into online mattress seller Casper Sleep Inc. The retailer had considered a bid for the entire business, a person familiar with the situation said in May.\nMatthew Boyle, Bloomberg News\n--With assistance from Spencer Soper"}

Another 422 people were injured as a result of Paddock\u2019s gunfire.\nNow Douglas Haig, 55, from Arizona has been formally charged with making the illegal ammunition.\nHe was previously a person of interest. Haig has since held a news conference to say he was innocent and had only briefly met Paddock who bought 720 rounds of ammunition from him once.\nCamera Icon Douglas Haig takes questions from reporters at a news conference. Picture: AP\nHaig told reporters he has received death threats in the days since his name was accidentally released in police warrants made public by a Nevada judge.\nHaig also said he sold ammunition as a hobby for nearly 20 years while working full time as an aerospace engineer.\n\u201cI had no contribution to what Paddock did,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI had no way to see into his mind. The product that I sold him had absolutely nothing to do with what he did. I\u2019m a vendor. I\u2019m a merchant whose name was released.\u201d\nHaig said he met Paddock briefly at a gun show in Phoenix, about a month before the shooting.\nPaddock then allegedly came to Haig\u2019s home in Mesa, on the outskirts of Phoenix, in September last year to buy some ammunition.\nCamera Icon Eric Paddock at left, and his brother, Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock.

That will amount to 5% of your unpaid taxes for every month \u2014 or part of a month \u2014 that you don\u2019t file for up to five months. So that penalty will cap out at 25% of your unpaid taxes.\nOn top of that you\u2019ll be subject to a failure-to-pay penalty, which amounts to 0.5% of your unpaid taxes every month, for up to 50 months, for a maximum of 25% of your outstanding balance.\nDid we mention interest? On top of these penalties, you\u2019ll also be charged interest on your unpaid taxes starting on April 19.\nHere\u2019s what you should do if you owe money but still haven\u2019t filed:\nAt least file something.\nAs the IRS helpfully notes, \u201cthe failure-to-file penalty is 10 times more than the failure-to-pay penalty. So if you can\u2019t pay in full, you should file your tax return and pay as much as you can.\u201d Or at least file for an extension and include some payment with it.\nLearn what your payment options are.\nThe IRS has a number of payment plans available if you can\u2019t pay all that you owe.\nIf you owe more than $10,000, you might consider hiring a tax attorney, enrolled agent or CPA with experience setting up payment plans to represent you.\n\u201cThe more that is owed to the IRS, the more complicated it becomes to negotiate with the government,\u201d according to Garrett and Deborah Gregory, two former IRS attorneys who wrote the \u201cGuide to IRS Collections for Liabilities under $10,000.\u201d\nFiling may help you avoid a late-payment penalty\nIf you\u2019ve already paid at least 90% of the taxes you owe for 2016, you may be spared the late-payment penalty so long as you at least file for an extension. You will, however, still owe interest on your unpaid balance until it\u2019s paid off.\nIf you\u2019re reading this and thinking I don\u2019t have to file today because I probably don\u2019t owe any more money, file anyway. What if you\u2019re wrong and it turns out you do owe money? If you don\u2019t file your return or apply for an extension, you\u2019ll get hit with the penalties above plus interest.\nSecond, if you\u2019re owed a refund, why wait?

KCNA via\nOn October 3, 1942 \u2013 75 years ago this year \u2013 a prototype German V-2 rocket launched from the German military firing range at Peenemunde in the Baltic reached an altitude of 84.5 kilometers (52.5 miles.)It was, by some definitions, the first human-built object in space.\nIt was the height of World War Two, and with the entry of the United States into the conflict the tide was already turning against Adolf Hitler and the Nazis. They knew, however, that if they could perfect both the world\u2019s first ballistic missiles and win the race to an atomic bomb, they would become virtually unassailable.\nHad Germany gotten the bomb first, the Allies most likely would have had to sue for peace rather than risk the Hiroshima and Nagasaki-like destruction of many Western cities.\nLuckily for the rest of the world, it was a capability Hitler never achieved. But it\u2019s a lesson that North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-Un appears to have taken to heart.\nWith two tests of his latest Hwasong-12 ballistic missile on July 4 and 28, he looks to be on the precipice of achieving what only a handful of America\u2019s enemies have dreamed of \u2013 the ability to hit the U.S. mainland with nuclear force.\nIt\u2019s a strategic sea change that has been a long time coming \u2013 and which many in the U.S. defense establishment have long expected. It\u2019s doubtful either North Korean or U.S. officials genuinely know how accurate North Korea\u2019s current rockets would be at intercontinental range. It\u2019s one thing to be able to fire a rocket a third of the way around the planet. It\u2019s another to know with certainty that it will hit a city, or that the warhead within it will actually explode.\nAs Pyongyang\u2019s test program moves forward \u2013 there seems little prospect of it pulling back \u2013 the answers to those questions will emerge. Already, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency is reported to be operating under the assumption North Korea has now perfected a small-enough warhead to fit on a rocket.\nKim\u2019s progress on rockets is even clearer. Analysis by the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies of video footage of the latest two launches suggests Pyongyang now has a working rocket motor based on Soviet rocket engines not used by Russia since the 1990s.\nIt\u2019s uncertain how Pyongyang acquired such technology so much quicker than expected. IISS suggests the most likely origins are ill-guarded military stockpiles or illicit networks in Russia and Ukraine. The important point, however, is that this is not especially sophisticated technology. If the North Koreans don\u2019t have it working yet, they \u2013 and the former Soviet scientists suspected to be helping them \u2013 will fix it before long.\nRussia, of course, has had the ability to inflict massive damage on the U.S. mainland since the at least the 1950s. Both Washington and Russia swarmed all over Germany\u2019s research sites after the war, taking that technology \u2013 and the experts behind it \u2013 and refining it still further. China too has been able to strike the U.S. since the 1960s.\nEach of those redefined Washington\u2019s diplomatic and military options. Broadly, however, both Moscow and Beijing have been seen largely as responsible fellow superpowers. For all the fears and paranoia of the Cold War era, there was often a general feeling that the fear of \u201cmutually assured destruction\u201d could keep things under control.\nThat is seen as less certain with Kim. It\u2019s not that the young North Korean leader is expected to lash out randomly with some kind of unilateral, unexpected strike \u2013 he knows that would result in his own regime\u2019s destruction. The entire point of his nuclear program has always been to safeguard his rule, not bring it to a cataclysmic early conclusion.\nThe problem, though, will come if and when the wheels start to come off the rule of the current North Korean leadership. There\u2019s no particular reason to believe it is on the verge of imminent collapse, but pressures on it will continue to rise.\nKim\u2019s hope seems to be that the more potent his nuclear capabilities, the more the rest of the world feels it has no choice but to allow him to stay in position. The opposite, however, may happen. This month\u2019s unanimous United Nations Security Council resolution sparked by the successful missile tests will notably increase economic strains on North Korea. China is frustrated, and is tightening the screws on Pyongyang with a ban on importing certain North Korean products such as coal and iron.\nWithin the U.S., meanwhile, there are growing calls for Washington to step up its attempts to aggressively destabilize North Korea, supporting some indigenous South Korean-based efforts to undermine Kim\u2019s rule.\nThe problem is that any revolution \u2013 whether outside inspired or not \u2013 or alternative end to the Kim regime is made more dangerous by the rising nuclear threat. Earlier this year, I chaired a panel that included former senior U.S. officials examining what might happen if the North Korean regime collapsed. Their conclusion was stark: if Kim felt he was about to be ousted or killed, he would almost certainly launch. Likely targets would be Japan and, if he could reach it, the U.S. mainland.\nU.S.-operated antiballistic missile batteries based in Japan and South Korea are supposed to provide a last-ditch defense against this kind of risk. However, such technology remains in its early stages. Shooting down a fast-falling ballistic missile remains difficult if not impossible. Shooting down several is harder still.\nAll this helps explain this last round of speculation over a potentially imminent strike, intensified by President Donald Trump\u2019s talk of \u201cfire and fury\u201d and military options being \"locked and loaded.\" For many in the U.S. national security establishment, there is a real feeling that this may be the last moment such an option is tenable. Others believe it is already too late.\nThe dangers of a conventional war on the Korean peninsula, particularly North Korean conventional artillery strikes on the South Korean capital of Seoul, were enough to deter Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama from taking military action against Pyongyang. North Korea\u2019s latest missile tests arguably put even further pressure on Trump to make the same calculus.\nWhich way this idiosyncratic, unpredictable president will jump, even he may not yet know. His advice from his national security team may well be deeply conflicting. Should he strike, some will unquestionably accuse him of simply trying to distract from domestic political woes.\nIf disaster does come, the U.S. may well regret acting \u2013 or not having acted sooner. In reality, though, it may always have been inevitable America would face a situation like this. Indeed, perhaps the surprise should be that it has taken this long."}

During their run of multiple championships, and even beyond, the Avalanche have frequently had a combination of skills that made them one of the most exciting teams to watch. From top to bottom, the Avs lines have always provided fans with great hockey. Here are the top lines in Avalanche history, in no particular order.\nGabriel Landeskog \u2013 Nathan MacKinnon \u2013 Matt Duchene\nDubbed \u201cThe 9 Line,\u201d this combination was thrown together during the 2015-16 season to try and get some scoring going, and they did not disappoint. During the time this line was together, it was the hottest line in the NHL and was the only line that did any scoring during that stretch. Though Patrick Roy was adamant that he wouldn\u2019t split the line up, it didn\u2019t stay together for the long haul.\nWhile this line was together, Matt Duchene set a franchise record for goals in the month of November where he scored 11 times. It was a line that had a ton of skill and speed that could take over games. While the line was very productive, it also highlighted exactly how much the Avs lacked depth at the time. This line definitely didn\u2019t have the staying power of some of the best lines in team history, but it was one of the most dynamic.\nShjon Podein \u2013 Stephane Yelle \u2013 Eric Messier\nThis is one of the most underrated lines in the history of the Avalanche. Stephane Yelle was a part of two championships in Colorado and was a defensive stalwart for both teams. Eric Messier was an excellent utility player that frequently swapped between defense and checking forward roles, depending on what the team needed at the time. Shjon Podein was a long-time Flyer that the Avs acquired in a trade for Keith Jones.\nWhile this line wasn\u2019t one of the more exciting lines to watch, they are still one of the best. Their job was to shut down the opposing team and play the hard minutes. Defense may have been their primary function, but this line was also capable of possessing the puck in the offensive zone, even chipping in a bit of offense. In fact, this line was responsible for one of the biggest goals of the 2001 Stanley Cup Playoffs.\nVille Nieminen \u2013 Chris Drury \u2013 Dan Hinote\nAnother line from the 2001 Stanley Cup Championship team, this one featured prominently in the playoffs. This line was the absolute epitome of \u201chard to play against.\u201d All three players were fast skaters, tenacious on the forecheck, could play physically and quickly transition turnovers into scoring chances.\nThis line was an excellent change-of-pace line for the Avalanche, who usually sent this trio out as their third line. First teams would have to deal with Joe Sakic and Peter Forsberg (until his spleen was taken out), only to see this group come at you. Nieminen and Hinote were the bangers, and Drury would usually reap the benefits with his speed and skill. Go back and watch these guys, they were exciting.\nAlex Tanguay \u2013 Joe Sakic \u2013 Milan Hejduk\nThe \u201cJAM Line\u201d is still one of the best lines ever to come together on the ice in Denver. Joe Sakic is one of the best all-around players in NHL history, Alex Tanguay could stick-handle in a phone booth and Milan Hejduk had one of the best scoring touches of any player in the league. Put them all together at the same time and you have sheer dominance. During their time together, Joe Sakic tallied one of his two 50-goal seasons and was named league MVP. Simply put, you couldn\u2019t stop this line\u2026you could only hope to contain them.\nValeri Kamensky \u2013 Peter Forsberg \u2013 Claude Lemieux\nBack to the early days of the Avs, this group absolutely dominated. Claude Lemieux was acquired just before the season began after winning the Conn Smythe with the New Jersey Devils the year before. He was one of the acquisitions that took the Avalanche from being a good team to a championships team. Peter Forsberg\u2019s greatness was just beginning to show and Valeri Kamensky is one of the most underrated scorers to ever play in Colorado.\nTo give you a picture of exactly how good this line was, during the 1995-96 season, all three of these players scored 30 goals. They combined for 107 goals, 165 assists, and 272 points. From a sheer production standpoint, this may have been the most dominant line in Avalanche history.\nScott Young \u2013 Joe Sakic \u2013 Adam Deadmarsh\nNot quite as dominant from a point production view, but still one of the best to play in Denver. This trio was another excellent combination of skills that made a complete line that gave opponents fits. Scott Young had speed and a wicked shot, Adam Deadmarsh brought grit and a net-front presence impossible to ignore and Joe Sakic was Joe Sakic.\nSuper Joe notched his first 50-goal season while playing with these two on his wings and went on to win the Conn Smythe Trophy after scoring 18 playoff goals. This line produced very well, but most of it was on Sakic\u2019s back.\nAlex Tanguay \u2013 Peter Forsberg \u2013 Milan Hejduk\nThis line rivals only the previous Forsberg line in skill and dominance. Tanguay and Hejduk have the unique distinction of being the wingers for both Avalanche players to win the Hart Memorial Trophy, first aiding Sakic\u2019s MVP. In the 2002-03 season, this line combined for 105 goals, 166 assists and 271 points. Considering that this was right in the middle of the \u201cdead puck\u201d era, this accomplishment is astonishing.\nThis line earned a lot of hardware at the end of the season. Forsberg came home with the Hart and Art Ross Trophies as league MVP and scoring champion. Hejduk also won the Rocket Richard Trophy with the only 50-goal season of his career. It is hard to argue against this being the greatest line in the history of the Colorado Avalanche.\n* originally published on August 3, 2017"}

It was used earlier at the \"Burning Man\" festival held outside Reno, Nevada. That event is known for its sexual libertinism, nudity and hippie-like activities.\nIf the final permit is issued, the nude statue called \"R-Evolution\" would go up around Friday, November 11. It would face the White House, between the Washington Monument and the World War II Monument.\n25 million children, families and tourists visit the Mall annually. They will be exposed to this unexpected display of female nudity.\n\"Parents don't want their kids to see this stuff. Nor do tourists expect to see nudity on the Mall. That's why so many decent people are standing up in peaceful protest,\" said C. Preston Noell III, spokesman for TFP.\n\"16,000 people have signed the petition in just a few hours, urging Park Service authorities to reject this indecent display on federal property.

(Photo: Sarah Rahal \/ The Detroit News)Buy Photo\nDetroit \u2014 Mayor Mike Duggan declared Wednesday that nobody from his office has been questioned or subpoenaed in regards to a federal grand jury evaluation of the city\u2019s demolition program.\nThe mayor added he\u2019s hoping for a speedy conclusion to the matter, and if people did wrong, they should be held accountable.\nDuggan, during a public appearance in northwest Detroit on Wednesday, briefly addressed the investigation a day after The Detroit News learned the grand jury was empaneled to focus on the blight fighting program and whether federal money was misappropriated while Detroit spent almost $200 million to demolish homes after the city\u2019s bankruptcy.\nThe effort has been under scrutiny and the focus of several investigations and reviews in the wake of concern over rising costs and bidding in fall 2015.\n\u201cI hope they\u2019ll move quickly because what we want is if somebody did something wrong they should be charged. If nobody broke the law, they should be cleared as soon as possible,\u201d Duggan told reporters.\n\u201cI hope they resolve it quickly, and we\u2019ll continue to cooperate in any way we can to speed the process.\u201d\nAs many as 30 contractors and city agencies are believed to have been subpoenaed to testify or provide documents regarding the program, according to sources familiar with the investigation and subpoenas reviewed by The News.\nThe target of the investigation is unclear.\nThe mayor stressed Wednesday his administration has been \u201ccompletely open from the beginning.\u201d\nThe grand jury is weighing potential violations of federal wire fraud and antitrust laws that prevent bid-rigging and unfair competition for federal funds, according to a source familiar with the investigation.\nDetroit has spent almost $200 million in mostly federal funds earmarked to help cities demolish thousands of homes hardest hit by the Great Recession. The city has taken down more than 11,670 under the program.\nThe grand jury investigation has been underway for approximately one month and investigators have sent contractors subpoenas demanding they provide copies of communications with various city agencies and Duggan\u2019s office, according to a subpoena obtained by The News.\nThe program also has been under investigation by the FBI and Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or SIGTARP.\nSIGTARP has said it does not publicly confirm or deny the existence of investigations.

The reason for a grand jury, he said, is to determine whether a crime has been committed.\n\u201cWhat you are seeing are issues that may or may not have occurred in 2014,\u201d said Duggan on Wednesday, adding U.S. Treasury recently released another $130 million for the program and it\u2019s \u201cmoving full speed ahead.\u201d\nAt issue during the demolition program\u2019s history is a controversial 2014 set-price pilot program for bulk demolitions that emerged after city officials met with a group of contractors.\nThree of the four local contractors participating in negotiations \u2014 Adamo Group, Homrich and MCM \u2014 were the sole bidders after the project was publicly offered.

Called the Ballastwater Equipment Manufacturers' Association (BEMA), it held its first Annual meeting on April 19, 2018 and has elected its inaugural Board of Directors.\nThe need for the association arose from the growing demand for well-founded information on the practicability of ballast water treatment technologies, as well as on the technical and environmental aspects of implementing ballast water management regulations worldwide.\nThe idea of forming an association of ballast water equipment manufacturers dates back many years.\n\"What makes this time different,\" says Mark Riggio of Hyde Marine who was elected President of the Association and was a member of the initial formation committee, \"is the realization that we needed to have a unified voice in the conversation.\" BEMA will be that voice.\nBEMA is a registered trade association based in the United States, with headquarters at 103 Oronoco St, Ste 200, Alexandria, VA 22314.\nThe association seeks to provide coordinated, technical, non-commercial guidance to both the maritime industry and regulatory agencies that are trying to understand the intricacies of ballast water treatment. It will serve as a key resource for shipowners, designers, testing equipment suppliers, and regulators to discuss openly how ballast water treatment systems work and what should be the expectations of each technology operating across a world fleet.\n\"It has been encouraging to see how enthusiastically the equipment manufacturers have embraced the organization,\" said Marcie Merksamer, Secretary General of BEMA and member of the formation committee. \"We have had a quick and energetic response from suppliers representing all of the major technology types in the industry and from every region of the world. BEMA is truly a global enterprise.\" During the initial formation meeting in London, held during the fifth session of IMO's Sub-Committee on Pollution Prevention and Response (PPR) in February this year, the organizers discussed applying for non-governmental organization (NGO) observer status at IMO in 2018.

It shouldn\u2019t.\nEarlier this month, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the lobbying arm of the health insurance industry, sent a letter to the Republican leadership demanding billions of dollars in new subsidies for Obamacare insurance policies.\nThe letter did not mention that health insurance companies are already enjoying record high profits without additional taxpayer subsidies.\nUnfortunately, the congressional leadership appears committed to giving the insurance companies what they want. The omnibus spending bill set to be released Monday will likely contain a provision that would send Obamacare insurers $10 billion in \u201creinsurance\u201d payments a year for three years \u2014 2019, 2020, and 2021.\nInstead of repealing the Obamacare regulations that have caused premiums to more than double since 2013, Republicans are set to buy off insurance companies to hide the true cost of rising premiums.\nDAILY The Western Journal Daily Email Breaking news updates and daily headlines from a news source you can trust. Facebook\nWhile advocates for these insurance subsidies argue that these payments will reduce premiums, it\u2019s essential to understand that they do not reduce premiums in real terms.\nThere\u2019s no real decrease in costs. They hide part of the premium by shifting it to taxpayers. That\u2019s a bailout.\nDon\u2019t think for a second that this would be a one-time $30 billion price tag. Why would a future Congress allow a $10 billion annual bailout to end on a cliff in 2022? Insurers\u2019 lobbyists will be back in 2022 leveraging their control over premiums for the spigot to continue.\nWhat congressional leadership would be agreeing to by including reinsurance bailout funds in this omnibus is a $10 billion annual corporate bailout in perpetuity.\nDo you think Republicans should stand firm against these bailouts?

Wade, but would also be voting to directly appropriate taxpayer dollars for insurance that includes abortion.\u201d\nThus far, none of the bailout proposals have included the Hyde Amendment.\nCongressional leadership needs to listen to the voters who sent them to Washington to end Obamacare. In a recent poll, 61 percent of Americans opposed Congress paying health insurance companies to temporarily lower premiums.\nRELATED: Johnny Kampis: Trump Should Slow Down Infrastructure Plan\nWhat Americans need is real relief from the Obamacare regulations that are already raising the cost of health care.

We will combat the counterfeiting and piracy that destroys American jobs,\" Trump said.\"We will safeguard the copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property that is so vital to our security and to our prosperity.\"Washington will turn a blind eye no longer,\" Trump insisted.The president said the US would no longer tolerate Beijing's \"theft\" of US industrial secrets, long a concern of major foreign corporations seeking a share of the huge Chinese market.\"We will engage in a thorough investigation and, if needed, take action to preserve the future of US industry,\" Lighthizer said.China's commerce ministry issued a statement voicing \"serious concern\" and warning that any US trade protectionism \"will definitely harm bilateral trade relations\".\"If the US side take actions that impair the mutual trade relations, disregarding the facts and disrespecting multilateral trade rules, China will not sit idle,\" the statement said.The ministry said the country \"is definitely going to adopt all appropriate measures to vigorously defend the lawful rights and interest of China.\"The United States is China's second-largest trading partner after the European Union, but Washington and Beijing have seen their relations grow increasingly fraught since a promising summit between Trump and China's Xi Jinping in April.The new intellectual property inquiry joins numerous investigations launched by Washington into Chinese trade practices, notably those concerning steel and aluminum and their national security consequences, which the Trump administration began earlier this year.However, the start of a US inquiry will not immediately result in open confrontation.Lighthizer will first need to reach a preliminary finding of unfair practices by China before opening a formal investigation, which could take as much as a year, administration officials said.The Chinese commerce ministry said the country has \"always been paying high attention to intellectual property right protection, continuously perfecting the legislation\", and that the progress it has made on that front is \"obvious to all\".Since launching his successful run for the White House and then taking office, Trump has frequently accused China of undermining the USThe bilateral US trade deficit with China approached $350 billion in 2016, and Trump has repeatedly blamed Chinese imports for gutting employment in US sectors such as steel.Last week, Washington announced preliminary against Chinese imports of aluminium foil. But so far, the US has not imposed heavier trade measures on Chinese goods.On Thursday, Trump reiterated the suggestion that he could soften his position on trade if Beijing were to do more to help rein in nuclear-armed North Korea.\"If China helps us, I feel a lot differently toward trade,\" he said.China said it would halt iron, iron ore and seafood imports from North Korea starting Tuesday, in accordance with new UN that Beijing voted to approve.US administration officials, however, have denied any link between the latest trade action and Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions.Beijing echoed this view Monday, with the foreign ministry saying the two matters were \"totally different.\"Despite Monday's expected action, Trump has so far refrained from making good on threats of retaliatory trade measures against China.This includes in particular concerns over Beijing's requirement that foreign companies establish local joint ventures.

The matchup went the full three games and the Wildcats pulled the upset on Merrimack\u2019s rink behind a 44 save effort by Danny Tirone in the final game. Warriors Head Coach Mark Dennehy remembered the meeting well.\n\u201cTirone gives me nightmares. He\u2019s a great competitor.\u201d\nWith memories in mind, the Warriors made the trip 48 miles north to take on the Wildcats. The roles were reversed; Merrimack was the underdog in UNH\u2019s building and the Wildcats wanted to improve their Conference standing with a victory. The Sunday matinee was one for the memories.\nUNH gave their fans reason to celebrate early as Jason Salvaggio sent the puck to Michael McNicholas in the slot. The senior from Manhattan Beach, CA, deked around Warrior goaltender Craig Pantano for a 1-0 UNH lead 34 seconds into the game.\nThe cheering did not last long as the Warriors capitalized on UNH\u2019s defensive breakdowns. Derek Petti got behind the UNH defense and snaked around Tirone for Merrimack\u2019s first shot on goal and first score 6:57 into the game.\nTwo minutes later, Sami Tavernier repeated Petti\u2019s move and gave Merrimack the lead. Alfred Larsson wrapped up the scoring after UNH turned the puck over behind their own net with 3:24 left in the period. UNH outshot the Warriors 14-9 in the period, but Merrimack held a 3-1 lead at the intermission.\nThe Warriors came out firing to start the second period. They outshot UNH 11-6 in the period and netted their fourth goal on a rush and a putback by Tyler Irvine. With that, Danny Tirone exited the game. The senior Alternate Captain of the Wildcats allowed four goals on 11 shots in one of his weakest performances this season. Coach Dick Umile took some blame for Danny\u2019s performance.\n\u201cHe\u2019s started every single game, including this stretch of five games in nine days. I did consider giving him a break after the RPI game, but I decided to go with him. Maybe he needed a night to breathe.\u201d\nMike Robinson replaced him and made his Whittemore Center debut.\n\u201cIt was a dream come true for me. I grew up in Bedford, New Hampshire, I went to these games growing up. So to finally play here was awesome.\u201d\nThe freshman performed well, saving all 12 shots Merrimack took against him in the game. UNH did not give him any goals in the period, so the Warriors held a 4-1 lead into the second intermission.\nThe UNH offense awoke in the third period, aided by some poor Merrimack penalties. Marcus Vela got a tip-in goal from Pantano\u2019s doorstep 2:17 into the period. Seconds later, Michael Babcock was called for an interference penalty. New Hampshire worked the ensuing power play to perfection, cycling the puck through the zone and beating Pantano on a laser by Patrick Grasso.\nThe chances kept coming for UNH, but they could not get the equalizer. Merrimack killed time with well placed clears and staples into the corner boards, and UNH took two penalties that slowed momentum. Still, the chances came.\nWith less than 10 seconds on the clock, Patrick Grasso got the puck on his stick and fired a backhand shot meant for the top shelf glove side. The puck sailed high and crashed off the glass, hitting the ice as time expired. Merrimack escaped with a 4-3 victory.\nHead Coach Mark Dennehy was happy with the win, but not thrilled.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve played much better in other games this year. We\u2019ll celebrate the win. It\u2019s only our fourth of the season. But we were determined to get them back into the game. We played with fire and escaped.\u201d\nMerrimack climbs to 4-9-3 overall and 2-6-1 in Hockey East. They jump out of last place in the conference, now one point ahead of Vermont. Freshman Evan Bell collected his first two collegiate points with assists on the Tavernier and Irvine goals.\nThe Warriors will close out the first half of the season with a Saturday matinee against Northeastern next week. Puck drops at 4pm at Lawler Rink.\nNew Hampshire wraps up their first half of the season and busiest stretch of the season in bitter disappointment. The Wildcats fall to 9-7-1 overall and 4-5-1 in Hockey East. They had a chance to break a tie with Maine, but left points on the table. Senior Michael McNicholas was crestfallen after the game.\n\u201cWe had a chance to win, but we shot ourselves in the foot those first two periods. We got too happy scoring so early and didn\u2019t play them well.\u201d\nWildcat Coach Dick Umile was upset after the game.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t happy with the effort of some guys last night and I thought today was about the same. That\u2019s not a good formula for winning hockey, playing from behind all the time.\u201d\nThe Wildcats will sit for Exams and take a needed two-week break before hitting the ice again. They next play in the Ledyard Bank Classic at Thompson Arena in Hanover NH. They\u2019ll face Dartmouth and Yale to end 2017. Puck drops at 7 pm on December 29th and at 4 pm on December 30th."}

Scott Walker and legislative Republicans to draw a new, balanced map of state legislative districts by Nov. 1, so that the new map will be in place for the 2018 elections.\n\u201cThe Wisconsin Legislature has continuously demonstrated a disregard for the rights of the voters and an inability to craft a fair, legal redistricting plan,\u201d said Gary Hebert of The Campaign Legal Center, which represented the Democratic plaintiffs in the case, in a statement released Friday. \u201cIn drawing a new plan, the Legislature must put voters first, not partisan politics.\u201d\nLast November, two of the three judges ruled that the current Republican-drawn map, which has been in place since 2011, was unconstitutional because it sliced and diced the state map into districts that would preserve the Republicans\u2019 lock on power, even when they win fewer votes than their Democratic counterparts.\nThat happened in 2012 and 2014, when Democrats won more votes than Republicans but were deep in the minority in the Legislature, raising questions about the legitimacy of one branch of state government.\nNow that map will be scrapped.\n\u201cThis is a huge win for democracy, and a huge win for the plaintiffs,\u201d emailed Sachin Chheda, director of the Fair Elections Project, which helped to organize the suit. \u201cOnce we won the verdict, the only real question was whether or not the court would demand that the redrawing process start immediately, and on a hard deadline. They have.\u201d\nTwo of the three judges, one appointed by a Republican and the other by a Democratic president, found that the Republicans\u2019 map was so pro-Republican that it was unconstitutional\u2014the first time a legislative map was struck down for partisan gerrymandering. They also accepted the defendants\u2019 use of the \u201cefficiency gap\u201d to measure partisan gerrymandering, the first time a court has affirmed a standard for excessive partisanship.\n\u201cThis decision is likely to be a landmark case, with the federal court accepting a bench-line formula for determining unconstitutional partisan gerrymanders,\u201d said state Rep. Fred Kessler (D-Milwaukee) in a statement Friday. Kessler is a nationally recognized expert on redistricting and helped to organize the opposition to the Republican map.\nWill the Next Map Be Fair?\nIn their November decision, the judges ordered the plaintiffs\u201412 Democratic voters who argued their civil rights were violated because their votes were wasted in the Republicans\u2019 map\u2014and the defendants, the state, to come up with possible remedies for the dispute.\nOn Friday, the judges decided that Republicans should redraw the maps by November 2017, so that they can be in place for the 2018 elections, and that they must meet the standard the judges accepted in their original decision. That means the Legislature must draw and pass the new maps and Walker must sign it by Nov. 1. Chheda said the plaintiffs will be allowed to weigh in on the map the state submits to the judges.\nIn short, the Republicans need to draw a map that\u2019s constitutional and fairly represents the interests of both Democrats and Republicans. That means they have to squeeze out some of their own members to craft more balanced districts. Those likely on the chopping block are Republicans in suburban areas, where there\u2019s a healthy mix of Republican and Democratic voters.\nThat said, the spokesman for state Attorney General Brad Schimel, a Republican, said the state expects to appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.\nRepublicans had wanted the federal judges to put their November decision on hold until the Republicans could send their case to the Supreme Court, but Friday\u2019s decision denied that request and will allow the Republicans to draw the map and also appeal the decision at the same time. If the Supreme Court accepts the November decision, the new map will be in place in 2018. If the high court overturns the November decision, the old, unconstitutional map will remain in place.\nWhatever the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately decides, Friday\u2019s decision allows the current Legislature, elected under an unconstitutional map, to remain in place, instead of calling for new elections quickly. That means the representation of Democrats is low. This Legislature will be making major decisions about the state budget, education, transportation funding and health care through January 2019, when the next Legislature is sworn in. But Democrats will lack fair representation for the next two years.\nLeading Democrats are calling for the public to be involved in the drawing of the next map. The current, unconstitutional map was drawn in secret by Michael, Best and Friedrich attorneys and top Republicans in an office on the Capitol Square. They attorneys were paid $431,000 by the taxpayers for their clandestine project. Republican legislators were allowed to see their districts in the new gerrymandered map, but had to sign a secrecy oath to do so. Democrats didn\u2019t get to see the Republicans\u2019 unconstitutional map while it was being drawn.\nIn a statement Friday, Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca said \u201ca new map should be subject to public hearings in different parts of the state to ensure that voters are choosing their representatives, not the other way around.\u201d\nThere are also calls for taking the redistricting process out of the hands of politicians. State Sen. Dave Hansen (D-Green Bay) has proposed a nonpartisan redistricting process so that elected officials are no longer in charge of drawing legislative districts and selecting their constituents."}

It\u2019s something that we have to be better with.\u201d\nTrailing 1-0 to Milwaukee in their best-of-seven opening-round playoff series, the Raptors will look to hit the ground running when they host the Bucks in what DeRozan called a must-win Game 2 on Tuesday.\n(DeRozan never owned a Regal. \u201cHell no,\u201d he laughed, when queried. \u201cBut I knew people who did.\u201d)\nCOMMENTARY: The Raptors are destined for a short playoff run this year\nSlow starts was a theme of Monday\u2019s post-practice session with the media. Whether it\u2019s rebounding from a loss or rallying from a slow start, the Raptors have traditionally been good when playing from behind.\n\u201cThat\u2019s our biggest mystery,\u201d said Toronto coach Dwane Casey, who turned 60 on Monday. \u201cI\u2019ve always said it\u2019s a hard way to live.\n\u201cI like it because it means we do have fight, but let\u2019s start that fight in the first quarter. We\u2019ve had it in stretches but we\u2019ve lived by being down and coming back. (But) it\u2019s taxing. It\u2019s hard on your body. It\u2019s not a great way to live, to be always fighting back, scratching, coming back.\u201d\nCasey said the team has studied its first-quarter conundrum. The Raptors have looked at the stats, the rotations, the match-ups, the various groups of players on the court.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done everything and there is no consistent statistic or number or group,\u201d Casey said. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of been our DNA. Slow starts and hard finishes.\u201d\nREAD MORE: Playoff berths for Maple Leafs, Raptors mean boost to Toronto economy\nCasey compared it to his days as an assistant in Dallas, where Josh Howard was one of the Mavericks\u2019 best first-quarter players and Dirk Nowitzki was a notoriously slow starter.\n\u201cSome guys it takes a little longer to get their bones going and bodies moving,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s fortunate and unfortunate.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fortunate that we do have the grit and the grime to fight back, but sometimes it jumps up and bites you in the behind.\u201d\nDeRozan, who led Toronto with 27 points \u2013 12 more points than he\u2019d ever scored in an opening game of the first round \u2013 said the Raptors need to play with a sense of urgency they didn\u2019t show in Saturday\u2019s stunning 97-83 loss.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that we can\u2019t feel our way into,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait for a team to hit us, whatever it may be.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to have an automatic start and get out as soon as that ball goes up.\u201d\nSerge Ibaka, who was acquired by the Raptors in a deal with Orlando at February\u2019s trade deadline, has seen the tendency for slow starts in the two months he\u2019s been in Toronto. He also has no answer.\nREAD MORE: Toronto Raptors to play Milwaukee Bucks in first round of NBA playoffs\n\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know why because what I saw from guys, every time before the game, everybody is ready, everybody is motivated,\u201d said Ibaka. \u201cLike even today, people are here earlier, working hard to get ready for tomorrow and then when it comes to the game, those kind of things happen.\n\u201cEven for myself, sometimes I ask myself why.\u201d\nIbaka, who had 19 points and 11 rebounds in Game 1, sat out Monday\u2019s practice with a sprained ankle suffered Saturday night. But he said he should be good to go Tuesday.\nDeRozan was also asked about his back-court mate Kyle Lowry, who had just four points on Saturday. Lowry responded the next morning by saying he\u2019ll have to be more aggressive and \u201cforce more shots\u201d come Game 2.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just him figuring it out,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cOne thing, Kyle\u2019s mind works at 1,000 miles per hour.\n\u201cOnce he settles down, he\u2019s going to figure it out. . . when to make the right pass, when to take the shot, when to be aggressive. Whether it\u2019s in spurts, being aggressive scoring, or whether it\u2019s in spurts getting everybody involved, he going to mellow down, calm down, and get that part of it together.\u201d\nThe series shifts to Milwaukee for Game 3 on Thursday and Game 4 on Saturday."}

Ford is building a rolling road aerodynamic tunnel with a series of conveyor belts that will move under vehicles of every size and description\u2014making it more realistic by essentially bringing the road to the vehicle. \u201cAs the technology on our vehicles has been advancing, we need the capability of moving-ground simulation to validate design,\u201d Shuk said.\nEach vehicle will be put on a dyno with a moving belt under each of the four wheels and a fifth large moving belt under the center of the vehicle to get proper airflow underneath it. The tunnel will be able to test vehicles at simulated speeds of up to 155 mph with all the belts in motion. Or engineers can turn off all but the big strip of conveyor and unleash 200-mph winds\u2014something Ford didn\u2019t really need before it created the GT and returned to racing. Having won the 2016 Le Mans 24 Hours, the team wants to add to the trophy case.\n\u201cThis new wind tunnel facility will not only allow us to test our performance and racing vehicle lineup but will also enable us to share innovations across all our global Ford products,\u201d said Dave Pericak, Ford Performance global director.\nAfter a couple years of operation, phase two will add an advanced climate chamber that can dip to temperatures as low as -40 degrees Fahrenheit or as high as 140 degrees, said Shuk. Ford is still working on the specs for that portion of the complex.\nFord is not first to invest in the latest in aerodynamic testing but neither is it the last. More accurate data, efficiency, and repeatability that can be applied to product development makes it a prudent investment, Shuk said. It will help with design, fuel efficiency and the ability to meet future legislative regulations.\nExisting wind tunnels and climate chambers remain in place for the foreseeable future and there are no plans to retrofit them.\nThe new testing complex is not part of the larger plan to update Ford\u2019s many facilities in Dearborn."}

(AP) \u2014 It took years for New Mexico lawmakers to finally reach consensus on overhauling the storefront lending marketplace by capping interest rates. But state regulators have yet to finalize the rules needed under the new law to bolster consumer protections and enforcement.\nA panel of lawmakers heard from consumer advocates this week who are pushing for the regulations to be finished and for loopholes to be closed.\nAn interim legislative committee passed a resolution Monday asking regulators to report on how they're enforcing the law. That report is due later this year.\nThe Regulation and Licensing Department's Financial Institutions Division has received four complaints against licensed small-loan lenders since January, when the law took effect. The agency didn't release details about those cases but said each complaint is thoroughly investigated.\nLindsay Cutler, an attorney with the New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty, said without more information on enforcement, consumer advocates don't have a clear picture of how the small loan industry is doing business under the new law.\n\"All New Mexicans deserve access to fair and transparent loans under reasonable terms, but generations of low-income families and Native American communities have been aggressively targeted by unscrupulous store front lenders,\" she said in a statement.\nFinancial Institutions Division spokeswoman Bernice Geiger said the agency is in the final stages of reviewing comments collected during public hearings held earlier this year in Santa Fe and Gallup as it works to finalize the regulations.\nThere are now about 600 licensed small-loan outlets in New Mexico, according to the agency.\nThe local store-front lending industry has defended high interest rates as a way to ensure borrowing options for low-income residents in New Mexico, where high poverty and unemployment rates are chronic.\nLegislation approved in 2017 by the Democrat-led Legislature and Republican Gov. Susana Martinez included a variety of consumer protections to discourage predatory lending practices. Limits on fees and interest for loans are combined with requirements giving borrowers at least 120 days to repay in at least four installments \u2014 effectively eliminating payday loans tied to the next paycheck.\nThe anti-poverty group Prosperity Works is concerned about renewals of loans made before the changes were adopted.\nMichael Barrio, the group's director of advocacy, said some contracts that have been reviewed include provisions that a failure to pay in full could trigger numerous automatic renewals without expressed consent and that lowering the interest rate to the new cap requires borrowers to refinance or seek more principal from lenders.\n\"We know what it actually comes down to is these kinds of loans really serve to just keep people in a cycle of debt rather than liberating them from it,\" Barrio said.\nThere are efforts underway to bring to New Mexico more small-loan alternatives. A number of local governments already are offering loans with moderate interest rates for public employees with little or no credit history. The loans are repaid through payroll deductions.\nThe issue is that program is only available to governments and companies with 200 workers or more. Barrio said that cuts out a significant number of people who can participate given the number of small businesses in New Mexico."}

It wasn\u2019t really until I read through the questions that I was reminded that my persona has a voice in the community.\nObviously, over the years I have had people say to me that they read this column, which is probably a good thing, because I\u2019ve been doing it for almost five years now and I would suspect they would have kicked me to the curb by now if no one was reading it. But often I forget that people actually take what I say at face value.\nThey say a magician should never reveal his secrets. With that said, I probably shouldn\u2019t tell you this but sometimes I wonder why people do listen to my ramblings.\nMost of my days are filled with a roller coaster that climbs to self confidence, only to plummet to the bottom, where I am met with self-doubt and wondering when people are going to realize I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. What started as a weekly account of what\u2019s happening in the city\u2019s food community has over time become my own personal journey, documenting the trials and tribulations of my life, as a chef, as a small business owner, and as a human being.\nMaybe, just maybe, that\u2019s why people read it.\nI think that\u2019s what has really changed about the way we take in media these days. There are many more of us sharing our personal stories, our thoughts on life and the things we are perceived to be experts at.\nIt also opens the floor to those who sit on the sidelines with a tidbit of knowledge, touting themselves as experts and trying to refute your every point.\nIt\u2019s not all bad, though. As a person who historically would have classified himself as an introvert, I have found that social media has allowed me to have a voice outside of the confines of our kitchen, which is where my thoughts likely would have ended even 10 years ago.\nIt has also brought me out of my shell and allowed me to meet new people.\nIt was shortly after I found myself on Twitter that I responded to a tweet from a local lady named Ashley Sexsmith, aka @chattygirlmedia. She had recently been in Calgary, where she had enjoyed her first ball of arancini. When she came back, she shared her enthusiasm for it and asked if anyone in town had them on their menu.\nSmelling an opportunity to gain some business, I told her that we would make some for her. A few days later she came in with a table of four. She loved our risotto balls and we hit it off. Before I knew it she was coming in fairly regularly, each time bringing in a different group of people. Soon, my network grew, meeting friends of friends, booking more dinners, selling gift cards, even hosting company Christmas parties.\nAll of this business stemmed from replying to one tweet.\nIt was at that point that I realized the value of using social media to build my brand, my network, and what would become my following. While it\u2019s not the only reason we have managed to build a fairly successful restaurant, I use it as a reminder for me that people are watching and what I say is being heard, even if sometimes I shouldn\u2019t be saying what I do.\nIn honour of this, here\u2019s a recipe for a basic arancini that you can twist and turn to your liking. The only limit is your imagination.\nARANCINI\nPrep Time: 20 minutes\nCooking Time: 5 minutes\nSpecial Tools: deep fryer\nMakes: about 30 balls\nThe first thing you need to know about arancini is that they are fried balls of cooked risotto.\nThe term arancini is the Italian word for little orange, which often references their size. They are believed to date all the way back to 10th century Sicily, when the island was under Arab rule.\nMany regions in Sicily use the arancini as a traditional food for the feast of Santa Lucia on December 13, when pasta and bread are not. It commemorates the arrival of a grain supply ship on Santa Lucia\u2019s day in 1646, relieving a severe famine.\nToday, I think they are popular because they are versatile and a great way to use up cooked risotto rice when you\u2019ve made too much. You can use this opportunity to flavour the risotto any way you like, either in the initial cooking process or after the fact, if you like. There are so many great combinations.\nI really enjoy prosciutto and spring pea, finished with some gruyere, or mushroom, leek and thyme, but the world is your oyster.\nWhip up a dipping sauce, like honey mustard aioli or chive and truffle sour cream, and you\u2019ll be in heaven!\n1kg. cooked risotto (flavoured to your liking, think of classic pairings)\n3 cups bread crumbs (this isn\u2019t the time for your fancy panko crumbs)\n1 cup flour, seasoned\n1 cup milk\n15 ea. eggs\nTT S&P\nPecorino for finishing\nPreheat the deep fryer to 335F\nForm the cooked risotto into 30 balls, about the size of a golf ball\nIf you\u2019re up for some fun you can squeeze a chunk of cheese into the centre of the ball, like brie, or taleggio, to give it a super gooey middle when it cooks\nAssemble a breading station, first by placing the seasoned flour in a large flat dish, then combine the eggs and milk, whisk together and place in a large shallow dish next to the flour. Lastly, place the bread crumbs next to the egg wash.\nLay a clean baking pan down to the right of the bread crumbs\nNow, working from left to right, gently place the risotto balls in the flour, rolling them to coat, then shaking all excess flour off\nFrom there, gently place the risotto ball in the egg wash, gently rolling it around to coat all sides, lifting it out, to shake off the excess, and immediately place in the bread crumbs\nRoll the risotto ball in the bread crumbs to coat evenly\nNow, you have the option to do a second breading, going back into the egg wash, and then the bread crumbs one more time.

Ocalan is serving a life sentence in a Turkish prison for crimes related to the PKK militant movement.According to Turkish media, the skyward-facing portrait is located on the slope of Mount Darmik in the north-western Syrian Kurdish enclave, which is being targeted by a Turkish air-and-ground operation. The footage of the airstrike shows the giant portrait from the air before a powerful explosion hits it. As the clouds of smoke and dust dissipate, a gaping hole can be seen where the Kurdish leader's month was. According to the Daily Sabah, the bombing was done by a domestically-developed armed drone of the Turkish air force. Turkey has several armed drones in various stages of development, including the armed version of the Vestel Karayel, which reportedly was first used for a combat mission in 2016.But TRT Haber TV station says the laser-guided bomb was dropped on the portrait by an F-16 jet, with a reconnaissance drone later confirming the hit.Ocalan is a prominent Kurdish leader and founder of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), an organization that waged a decades-long guerilla war against the Turkish government. He was captured by Turkish forces in 1999 following an intelligence operation in Kenya, while being transported from the Greek embassy to an airport. He was later tried and sentenced to death for treason but never executed, since Turkey has had a de facto moratorium on the death penalty since the mid-1980s.Despite his continued incarceration, Ocalan continues to be a powerful symbolic figure for many Kurds. For instance, his portrait was prominently displayed amid much celebration in Raqqa, after the city was taken by US-supported, predominantly Kurdish militias last year. Ankara interprets such gestures as proof that Kurdish armed groups in Syria and Iraq are nothing more than an extension of the PKK, which is labelled a terrorist organization in Turkey.The ongoing cross-border operation in Afrin was launched by Turkey following the US announcement of a plan to create a Kurdish border security force, which Turkish officials pre-emptively branded a terrorist army."}

The views in this article are those of the author.\n(CNN) Since becoming President, Donald Trump has, at times, looked like a wrecking ball to the international order.\nBut when it comes to North Korea, he may be forced to operate within the narrow constraints of his predecessors.\nPresident Obama famously decided that the best way of dealing with the autocracy was with a policy of \"strategic patience.\" In practice, this meant strengthening sanctions and waiting for North Korea to decide itself that halting its nuclear program would be prudent.\nSome members of the President's Republican Party have previously argued for a more forceful response to North Korean aggression.\nTrump's Twitter activity, prior to his inauguration, suggested that he was in agreement with this line of thinking.\nNorth Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2017\nBut while taking such steps would be vigorous and decisive, it could possibly lead to a wider war.\nSeoul, the South Korean capital, is within striking range of North Korean artillery, and Kim Jong Un has not been shy about his readiness to lash out.\nSuch escalations might include the shelling of South Korean-held islands off of his coastline, the insertion of landmines into the Demilitarized Zone, attacks on the South Korean navy, or even commando attacks on the Blue House (the home of South Korea's president) in Seoul.\nEscalation can happen very quickly on the peninsula -- as was the case in the summer of 1950 , when a series of border clashes on the 38th parallel turned into an all-out invasion of South Korea.\nThis context is important to remember when trying to understand the limits facing Trump in constraining North Korea, a country that has managed to grab headlines recently with another missile launch.\nWhen he was in Seoul earlier this month, US Defense Secretary James Mattis sought to deter North Korea by threatening the country with \"a response that will be effective and overwhelming\" in the event of an attack on the US or its allies.\nBut this most recent North Korean test was neither nuclear nor an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking the United States.\nThis incremental advance in North Korea's weapons program, therefore, wasn't \"the big one\" in terms of steps the country could take to provoke the US.\nNor has the country resumed its nuclear tests since Trump arrived in office -- having carried out four such tests during the Obama years, undeterred by UN resolutions forbidding such actions.\nTrump has made a great deal of noise since arriving in office but, paradoxically, his failure to focus on a North Korea policy has created a small space for progress on what the Obama administration considered to be the greatest threat to US security.\nThe Obama administration had pushed very hard for the inclusion of human rights and even International Criminal Court prosecution as a pressure point against North Korea, much to the anger of the regime.\nThe lack of criticism of North Korea's many documented human rights violations from the State Department and new Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is surely music to Pyongyang's ears.\nNorth Korean state media is at present keeping its powder dry: it has not yet attacked Donald Trump by name or criticized him for anything.\nJUST WATCHED North Korea improves missile program Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH North Korea improves missile program 02:16\nEven Mattis' visiting Seoul and the meetings between National Security Adviser Michael Flynn with his South Korean counterpart were not lambasted.\nFor all its reputation of being a crazed and irrational state, North Korea appears to be taking a rational approach to Trump and waiting to see what happens in Washington.\nSo could Trump, so keen on deal-making, use this small leverage to talk some sense into Kim Jong Un? Unlikely. If North Korean state media is to be believed, Kim's subjects are hungering for a showdown with the US -- and are fiercely proud of their emerging nuclear deterrent and missile capabilities.\nIt is doubtful that Trump will be able to change this. Short of sending Tillerson or traveling to North Korea himself, it seems unlikely that he will make a significant breakthrough.\nThe only realistic approach for the White House, it seems, would be to closely monitor the rhetorical chest-thumping -- along with the huge military exercises on both sides of the DMZ -- and hope that a small conflagration does not escalate into something more dire. In other words, with North Korea taking a seemingly more cautious approach with the new administration, \"strategic patience\" may bring Trump more success than it did Obama."}

More than half of the central bank's 12 regions reported a pickup in industrial activity and a third of the districts described manufacturing conditions as \"strong.\"\nThe survey was taken after the Trump administration announced plans to institute tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum, actions designed to boost domestic producers.\nIt will inform discussions when the central bank meets on June 12-13. Economists believe the central bank will boost rates for a second time this year as the Fed gradually pushes its benchmark rate higher.\nThe administration in March imposed punitive tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on the grounds of national security. It granted temporary exemptions to the European Union, Canada and Mexico \u2014 but that reprieve is scheduled to end Friday.\nThe Fed survey, known as the beige book, found that among the manufacturing sectors reporting new strength were fabricated metals, heavy industrial machinery and electronics equipment. Fabricated metals in particular would be a prime beneficiary of higher tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.\nThe survey said while the outlook for near-term growth is upbeat, businesses did express concern about uncertainty being increased by the administration's actions in trade policy. Many economists have also expressed concern that the higher tariffs on imported goods could boost inflation in this country and act as a drag on growth.\nThe beige book noted prices in general are rising at a moderate pace although there were reports of rising materials costs, notably for steel, aluminum, oil, lumber and cement.\nKsenia Bushmeneva, an economist at TD Economics, said trade tariffs are already having an impact on raw materials costs, with lumber prices up 35 percent since the start of the year and the price of steel, used in autos and many other products, up 40 percent.\n\"At the end of the day, American consumers will pick up the bill as companies are increasingly passing higher costs on to consumers,\" Bushmeneva said."}

The reason is quite simple. I am managing dividend growth portfolios for clients that are retired and require at least a yield of 3% or better in order to live on. Moreover, in addition to the minimum yield threshold, I am also looking for quality, consistency, and attractive valuation. Unfortunately, it has become exceedingly difficult to find high quality dividend growth stocks that meet all of those criteria.\nConsequently, I am not currently invested in Lowe's (LOW) because it does not meet my 3% or better dividend threshold, but I am becoming quite interested as a total return option. In addition to investing for income, I also invest for total return for myself and for select clients who are also primarily interested in total return. Lowe's has attracted my attention as a result of its stock price correcting approximately 10% since the spring of this year. Furthermore, the company offers above-average earnings growth potential. Therefore, I see the company currently fairly priced in relation to both its recent historical growth, coupled with its expected future growth.\nAs a result, I have begun initiating a comprehensive research and due diligence effort on this Dividend Aristocrat as a long-term total return opportunity. The purpose of this article is to share my initial analysis with others who might also be interested. To be clear, I have not yet made a final decision to purchase Lowe's. However, based on what I've seen thus far, I'm leaning in that direction. Nevertheless, I will let the reader decide for themselves whether this is an appropriate option or opportunity.\nFAST Graphs Fundamental Preview on Lowe's\nSince a picture's worth 1000 words, and a video worth many more, I offer the following FAST Graphs fundamental analysis on Lowe's. In the video, I will take a look at Lowe's valuation relative to several important fundamental metrics. These would include operating earnings, operating cash flow, free cash flow, and EBITDA.\nSummary and Conclusions\nIf you're a long-term investor looking for a company offering above-average growth, fair valuation, and a dividend kicker, then Lowe's Companies Inc. might be worth considering. Personally, I like both Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's based on their long-term operating success, scale and future growth potential. The only reason I would choose Lowe's over Home Depot is a slightly more attractive current valuation. Nevertheless, I have begun a more comprehensive research and due diligence endeavor on Lowe's based on the fundamental metrics I highlighted in the video.\nDisclosure: No position at the time of writing.\nIf you enjoyed this article, scroll up and click on the \"Follow\" button next to our name to see updates on our future articles in your feed.\nDisclaimer: The opinions in this document are for informational and educational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell the stocks mentioned or to solicit transactions or clients.

People who eat fried potatoes two or more times a week double their risk of an early death compared to those who avoid them, a recent study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found.\nEating potatoes that have not been fried was not linked to a similar early mortality risk, the researchers noted.\n\u201cFried potatoes consumption is increasing worldwide,\u201d warned Dr. Nicola Veronese, lead author of the study and a scientist at the National Research Council in Padova, Italy.\nIn 2014, Americans consumed 112.1 pounds of potatoes per person, according to the National Potato Council. Of that total, 33.5 pounds were fresh potatoes, the remaining 78.5 pounds were processed. According to the US Department of Agriculture, the majority of processed potatoes Americans eat are French fries.\nTrans fats in fried potatoes\nVeronese and his colleagues have been tracking 4,440 people aged 45 to 79 over a period of eight years to study osteoarthritis. This research team decided to momentarily set aside the main issue of osteoarthritis and look at participants\u2019 consumption of potatoes.\nEven though most of us may have assumed that fried potatoes could be unhealthy for us, there is \u201cvery limited\u201d scientific data on this issue, Veronese explained in an email.\nSo the researchers divided study participants into subgroups based on how frequently they ate potatoes each week. Over the eight years, a total of 236 of the participants died. Analyzing the data for each group, Veronese and his team found that those who ate fried potatoes two to three times each week doubled their chance of dying early compared to those who ate no fried potatoes.\nFrench fries, potato chips, hash browns \u2014 and any other preparation requiring a fryer \u2014 are all included under the umbrella of \u201cfried potatoes,\u201d Veronese explained.\nAge or sex of participants did not influence the result, but the data showed men were more likely than women and younger participants were more likely than older participants to enjoy the fried food.\nThe study is observational, meaning the researchers simply tracked the behavior of a group of people and found an association between one behavior \u2014 eating fried potatoes \u2014 and another factor \u2014 early death. Because it is an observational study, Veronese and his co-authors note it cannot be said that eating fried potatoes directly causes an early mortality \u2014 it would require more research to draw such a firm conclusion.\n\u201cEven if it is an observational study, we believe that the cooking oil, rich in trans-fat, is an important factor in explaining mortality in those eating more potatoes,\u201d said Veronese. Trans fat has been shown to raise the \u201cbad,\u201d or LDL, cholesterol in the blood, which can lead to cardiovascular disease.\nYet, he also added that \u201cother important factors,\u201d including obesity, a sedentary lifestyle and use of high quantities of salt might also play a role in the early death of those eating two or more portions of fried potatoes each week.\nNational Potato Council CEO John Keeling said the \u201cstudy isn\u2019t relevant to the general population\u201d since the data was collected for an osteoarthritis study and includes only patients with arthritis. \u201cPotatoes are inherently a very healthy vegetable,\u201d said Keeling in an email. He said a medium-sized potato is 110 calories, has no fat, no sodium, no cholesterol, and provides nearly a third of the daily vitamin C requirement with more potassium than a banana.\n\u201cHow the potato is prepared will impact the calorie, fat and sodium content,\u201d said Keeling, however the basic nutrients remain \u201cno matter how it is prepared.\u201d\nBased on the data in the study, Keeling said, \u201cit is very much a stretch to brand fried potatoes, or any other form of potato, as unhealthy.\u201d\nSusanna Larsson, an associate professor at the Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden, noted that the new study provides \u201cno evidence\u201d that potato consumption in and of itself may increase the risk of an early death. Larsson was not involved in the new study. Instead, it may be the \u201cother factors\u201d suggested by Veronese himself.\n\u201cFried potato consumption may be an indicator of a less healthy (Western) dietary pattern which is associated with increased mortality,\u201d said Larsson, who also conducted a study of potato consumption. Her study did not find an increased risk of cardiovascular disease linked to eating potatoes.\nUnderstanding acrylamide\nThe potential danger when eating fried starchy foods, such as French fries, is acrylamide, said Stephanie Schiff, a registered dietitian at Northwell Health\u2019s Huntington Hospital in Huntington, New York. Schiff was not involved in the study.\nAcrylamide is \u201ca chemical produced when starchy foods such as potatoes are fried, roasted or baked at a high temperature,\u201d explained Schiff in an email. The browning process is actually a reaction that produces this chemical one shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals and considered toxic to humans, said Schiff. Acrylamide is also a potential cause of cancer, she said.\n\u201cYou can reduce your intake of acrylamide by boiling or steaming starchy foods, rather than frying them,\u201d said Schiff. \u201cIf you do fry foods, do it quickly.\u201d\nShe also suggested you \u201cgo lighter\u201d since \u201cthe darker the food, the more acrylamide it may contain.\u201d\nFinally, Schiff said that potatoes should not be stored in the refrigerator because this could lead to producing more acrylamide when the potatoes are later cooked.\n\u201cIncrease your intake of fruits and vegetables for a healthier alternative,\u201d said Schiff.\nVeronese said he hopes his new study will suggest to everyone that consuming fried potatoes \u201ccould be an important risk factor for mortality. Thus, their consumption should be strongly limited."}

Nigerians should be concerned if government is borrowing to pay salaries, travels, training or for wasteful venture.\n\u201cBut, we are borrowing for long term infrastructure development, investments that allow businesses to thrive,\u201d she insisted.\nThe alternative to not borrowing to get out of recession, she argued, would have been to \u201cwait for oil price to recover,\u201d a situation that would have prolonged the recession.\nThe Minister assured that the country was not at risk of going into recession again if the price of oil crashes, pointing out that before the last recession, the country did not have as much cushion as today.\nBesides, she said ongoing government reforms now allow the Ministry of Finance to attend the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries meetings along with Ministry of Petroleum Resources officials, to get latest information and better outlook of issues.\nOn why government was still paying subsidy on imported petroleum products after it vowed not to do so, Mrs. Adeosun explained \u201cthe subsidy the marketers were demanding was arrears inherited from the previous administration.\u201d\n\u201cWe are not paying subsidy in the old sense of the way subsidy was paid to oil marketers. The subsidy they are clamouring for is what they were owed before the present administration came in.\n\u201cWe are negotiating with them to ensure our focus remains on our capital projects. That is really our priority."}

(AP) \u2014 North Carolina's understaffed prisons remain a dangerous place for employees six months after the bloodiest escape attempt in state history left four workers dead, according to agency data and separate case reports.\nAbout three dozen workers at the state's correctional facilities have been assaulted so badly that they have lost work time, prison officials said in response to a public records request from The Associated Press. Leading the official list of assaults is the Pasquotank Correctional Institution in Elizabeth City, where eight workers have been badly harmed since the fatal breakout attempt there on Oct. 12.\nThe list provided to the AP, which covered 34 assaults through March 27, did not include an attack at a Morganton prison that hospitalized a worker with stab or slash wounds. Officials from the state Department of Public Safety did not say why when asked Monday or during the previous two weeks.\nOn March 28, three more workers were assaulted in two attacks at Maury Correctional Institution in Greene County. It's not clear whether any of them were injured badly enough to miss work.\nCorrectional Officer Deborah Ezuma said the frequency of inmates assaulting workers has grown more common in the past two or three years than at any time in her 20-year prisons career.\n\"Our department has gotten extremely dangerous in recent years,\" said Ezuma, a guard at high-security Polk Correctional Institution in Butner. Previously, it was extremely rare for an inmate to touch prison staff, she said. \"Now it's nothing to touch a staff\" member.\nPrison officials have said since the four Pasquotank slayings and the beating death of a correctional officer at Bertie Correctional Institution last year, guards must work with a more concentrated cluster of violent criminals.\nSentencing reforms in 2011 have cut the number of inmates by 3,000, but nearly 1 in 5 of the 36,000 still serving time suffer some form of mental illness, state Prison Director Kenneth Lassiter said in January.\nState prison officials have not provided the details of each assault, or how many inmates have been attacked, both of which the AP requested six weeks ago. The agency has not effectively tracked data in the past on how often inmates are attacked, safety department spokeswoman Pamela Walker said Monday. She said officials have begun to collect that information and hope to make it available soon.\nAccording to data provided by the prisons agency, four assaults on workers took place at Polk between the date of the Pasquotank slayings and March 27. Four staffers of the Marion Correctional Institution in Marion, and five at Tabor Correctional Institution in Tabor City, were also hurt during that time frame. Both prisons include units housing high-security inmates.The agency recorded just one serious assault at Lanesboro prison, the maximum-security prison about 45 miles (70 kilometers) southeast of Charlotte where dozens of officers and inmates have been attacked since it opened in 2004.\nAnother happened two weeks ago, when a correctional sergeant responding to a report of an inmate being assaulted by other prisoners was stabbed or slashed with an inmate's makeshift blade. The male officer was treated at a hospital with injuries that were not believed to be life-threatening, Lassiter said.\nLanesboro, the state's largest with about 1,800 male inmates, will soon be converted to a women's prison under a reorganization that marks one way prison officials are trying to improve safety and security.\nIn January, more than 1 in 3 officer positions at Lanesboro were vacant. More than a quarter of correctional officer positions at both Pasquotank and Bertie were vacant last fall.\n___\nFollow Emery P. Dalesio on Twitter at http:\/\/twitter.com\/emerydalesio.

LEONARD | In the latest turn in the lengthy litigation waged by Gavin Grimm, a transgender teenager who recently graduated from his Virginia high school \u2014 to establish the right of students to access bathroom facilities consistent with their gender identity \u2014 the American Civil Liberties Union which represents him, has filed an amended complaint that argues his status as an alumnus who might visit the school gives him an ongoing personal stake in the issue.\nThe litigation, which began more than two years ago, has dramatically raised the visibility of transgender students who are seeking to assert their right to receive equal access to bathroom facilities in their schools, and at one point, Grimm\u2019s case seemed headed for the Supreme Court.\nGrimm\u2019s mother, Deirdre, originally filed suit on his behalf against the school board in July 2015 prior to his junior year in a Gloucester County high school. The suit alleged that the school\u2019s policy of requiring students to use restrooms based on their biological sex rather than their gender identity violated Grimm\u2019s right to be free of sex discrimination forbidden under Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 and the 14th Amendment Equal Protection Clause.\nACLU reframes case, focusing on his status as alumnus with ongoing personal stake\nIn September of that year, District Judge Robert G. Doumar dismissed Grimm\u2019s Title IX claim, while reserving judgment on the 14th Amendment claim, and denied his motion for a preliminary injunction allowing him to use the boys\u2019 bathroom and locker room while the case proceeded. With the case before Doumar, the Obama administration\u2019s Departments of Education and Justice filed a joint statement with the court supporting Grimm\u2019s Title IX claim.\nIn April of 2016, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals focused on that statement from the federal agencies, finding that Doumar should have deferred to their interpretation of the Title IX regulations, concluding it was reasonable. The Fourth Circuit panel reversed Judge Doumar\u2019s dismissal of the Title IX claim, and sent the case back to him to reconsider Grimm\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction.\nShortly after that, the Obama administration issued a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter to all the nation\u2019s public schools receiving federal funds, more formally stating the position on Title IX it had earlier conveyed in Grimm\u2019s case. In June of last year, Doumar issued the preliminary injunction Grimm had sought nearly a year before. Unfortunately for Grimm in his upcoming final high school year, the Supreme Court granted Gloucester County a stay of Doumar\u2019s injunction while the school district prepared to file for high court review. So, during his final school year, Grimm was still barred from using the boys\u2019 bathrooms.\nThe Supreme Court scheduled oral argument in the Grimm case for March 28 of this year, but after Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos withdrew the Obama administration interpretation of Title IX, the high court canceled that argument. The case was sent back to the Fourth Circuit to address the merits of Grimm\u2019s appeal under Title IX, absent any Executive Branch guidance on the issue.\nAfter the Fourth Circuit tentatively scheduled argument for this month, the school district argued the case had become moot because Grimm had graduated. But Grimm responded that his possible \u201cfuture attendance at alumni and school-community events\u201d at the high school gave him a continuing concrete interest in the injunction he sought, especially given the school\u2019s \u201cnoncommittal statement\u201d about whether its restrictive policy applied to alumni.\nUnder Supreme Court precedents, the court does not have jurisdiction in the lawsuit unless there is an \u201cactual case or controversy\u201d between the parties, so Grimm must show a concrete interest in the outcome, which would mean that the policy he is challenging actually affects him personally. The Fourth Circuit decided it did not have the factual basis to answer this question, so it referred the case back to Doumar for additional fact-finding.\nLitigating over the issue of mootness regarding a preliminary injunction did not strike the ACLU as the best approach at this point in the litigation, so it secured agreement from the school district to seek dismissal of Grimm\u2019s appeal at the Fourth Circuit, which it granted in mid-August. The ACLU, meanwhile, proceeded to file an amended complaint.\nThe new complaint supplements the original complaint and argues, \u201cAs an alumnus with close ties to the community, Gavin will continue to be on school grounds when attending football games, alumni activities, or social events with friends who are still in high school.\u201d This would support his continuing personal stake in the issue of appropriate restroom access at the school. The complaint reiterates the claim that Grimm\u2019s case rests on both the 14th Amendment and Title IX. The relief Grimm is seeking is a declaration that the school\u2019s policy is illegal, nominal damages symbolic of the injury done to him by denying him appropriate restroom access, a permanent injunction allowing Grimm to use the same restrooms as \u201cother male alumni,\u201d reasonable litigation costs and attorneys\u2019 fees, and \u201csuch other relief as the Court deems just and proper.\u201d\nThe school board can be expected to move to dismiss the amended complaint with the argument it made earlier that the case was moot, but this time the standing question will be litigated solely with respect to Grimm\u2019s alumni status going forward.\nThe case now appears to be assigned to District Judge Arenda L. Wright Allen, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2011 and issued a pro-marriage equality decision in 2014. Judge Doumar, 87, who issued the earlier rulings for the district court in Grimm\u2019s case, is a senior judge appointed by Ronald Reagan in 1981.\nThe recent Chicago-based Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in favor of Ash Whitaker, a trans student seeking to use the boys\u2019 bathroom in his Kenosha, Wisconsin, high school is being appealed to the Supreme Court. If the Whitaker case is accepted by the high court, it is likely that Grimm\u2019s case will be put on hold pending what could prove to be the definitive say on the matter."}

{"id":"cc1cc4de-071d-4870-a1ed-20cf84ea0303","text":"After 10 years of lean, threadbare, Lilliputian tales, Marvel Studios has, thank heavens, finally decided to go big.\nThe scale of \"Avengers: Infinity War,\" of course, isn't a departure for Marvel. It's an apotheosis. But is it possible to supersize what is already colossal? \"Infinity War,\" which brings together more than 30 significant characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe and enough spandex to clothe a small nation, is a little like launching an invasion after the war was already won. Despite assured dominance, Marvel has gone nuclear.\n\"Infinity\" is an interesting word for the Marvel machine, which sets much of its development pipeline a decade in advance. Never-ending is indeed how the superhero era of blockbusterdom sometimes feels, both to its fans and its critics. Even Steven Spielberg, who once said superheroes will eventually go the way of the western, recently signed on to produce a DC Comics film.\nBut the title refers to the six \"infinity stones\" scattered around the universe, each conveying a power of sorcery, like the time-warping one held by Doctor Strange. They are dearly sought by Thanos, the indestructible Titan warlord, who rules over much of space but would like all of it. With all the McGuffins - er, stones - he can, with the snap of his fingers, wipe away half of the universe's beings: a rapture to cull an overgrown herd, he envisions.\nAnd it's, in part, the lure of finality that has made \"Infinity War,\" directed by Anthony and Joe Russo (veterans of two \"Captain America\" movies), one of the year's most salivated-over movies. The preamble has been one long tease - we have seen fleeting glimpses of Thanos (Josh Brolin) since Barack Obama's first term - leading up to a battle royal that could mean the demise of some of Marvel's most famous faces.\nIt can be hard to know who or what to root for. Arguably the best quality - and most vital asset - of the Marvel canon is its star-making (or at least star-expanding) power. On the one hand, Chris Pratt's performance as Star-Lord in \"The Guardians of the Galaxy\" has been terrific and turned him into a household name. On the other hand, we've hardly seen Robert Downey Jr. outside of the Iron Man suit in the last decade. It took 18 months to shoot both parts of \"Infinity War\" back-to-back (the sequel is due out next summer), putting a stranglehold on some of our best movie stars, like Chris Hemsworth and Anthony Mackie. Faint cries can be heard on the street of: \"Let our Ruffalo go!\"\nAnd it's really the simple pleasure of seeing so many good actors together that makes \"Infinity War\" - an \"Ocean's Eleven\" in hyper drive - work. The screenplay, by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, spreads the heroes around in improvised groups that create some funny dynamics. The Guardians, who inject most of the life to \"Infinity War,\" swoon for Hemsworth's one-eyed Thor. \"He's like a pirate had a baby with an angel,\" says Dave Bautista's Drax. Many don't know each other, or the parameters of their shared \"cinematic universe.\" ''There's an Ant-Man AND a Spider-Man?\" remarks Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner, a.k.a. the Hulk.\nThe level playing field is a chance to rebalance the Marvel pecking order, most recently upended by Chadwick Boseman and \"Black Panther.\" Neither Chris Evans' Captain \"Cap\" America nor Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, for example, make much of an impact on \"Infinity War.\" But Zoe Saldana, as the green-skinned Gamora, strides to the fore, as does Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch. \"Infinity War\" rarely, surprisingly feels as overstuffed as such a superhero smorgasbord ought to, a testament to the filmmakers' adept plate-spinning skills.\nThat may be because \"Infinity War\" doesn't really belong to the superheroes. This is Brolin's film. Already an actor who can appear chiseled from granite, his Thanos is an imposing boulder of a villain, with weary eyes and lined creases running down his massive chin. He and his adoptive daughter, Gamora, are the only characters with much of a story in \"Infinity War.\" He's the immovable object around which the gaggle of superheroes orbits.\nThere may be some hint of overpopulation anxiety in Thanos' ambition and in the Russos' frighteningly overcrowded film. Its saviors repeatedly contemplate sacrifice. Previous \"Avengers\" chapters and the Russos' \"Captain America: Civil War\" expended some effort considering the Avengers' place in society and whether they should be controlled by the state. But this movie, a sensory onslaught, has little room for political subtext.\nStill, I doubt such gestures of allegory are anyone's favorite part of the Marvel movies. Most come for the action, the quips and the characters, and I suspect \"Infinity War\" will deliver for most - particularly thanks to the Guardians. In such a bruisingly long showdown, the action sequences - never the strongpoint of the Russos, who cut their teeth on comic ensemble like \"Arrested Development\" and \"Community\" - grow monotonous, and the interludes amid the rubble more infrequent. But if \"Infinity War\" is a lavish reunion tour propelled by star power, the Russos are sure to plays the hits.\nThe movie's ending - just one of the spoilers that divulging here would bring Thanos' fist down upon me - will be the major talking point. But for me, its power only lasts as long as a commercial break with an easy-to-see-through \"to be continued.\" Who lives and who dies? It's hard to fret too much with an eternity of sequels and spinoffs lined up.\n\"Avengers: Infinity War,\" a Walt Disney Co. release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for \"intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action throughout, language and some crude references.\" Running time: 149 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.\n___\nMPAA Definition of PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned.

It was on this date in 1941 that Hitler sent his army into Soviet territory. As a result, the day is considered to be the most solemn and tragic in Russia\u2019s history. Russia reasonably interpreted the date of the law\u2019s passing as a purposely intended insult.\nOn July 17, Polish President Andrzej Duda signed the \u201cdecommunization\u201d law. It will take effect in October.\nIn an interview to the Russian Kommersant newspaper, Polish Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski said, \u201cIf these monuments [to the Soviet soldiers] are in the cemetery, they are under protection [by Polish and international law]. If not, why should we appreciate them? The Soviet Union contributed to the outbreak of the World War II by signing the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and by attacking us in September 1939 from the east.\u201d\nWaszczykowski pointed out that these monuments were created by the local authorities, and as such, \u201cIn Poland, it is the responsibility of local authorities, the authorities of cities and villages to decide the future of these monuments.\u201d He added, \u201cIf they want to destroy them, this is the responsibility of the local authorities. Plus, these monuments are not protected by international laws and bilateral agreements between Poland and Russia.\u201d\nRussian Parliament reacted in fury.\nDeputy to Russian Parliament from the Communist Party Nikolai Kharitonov proposed to break off diplomatic relations with Poland and to recall the Russian ambassador. He said, \u201cWe need to drive away the Polish ambassador and shut off all the trade with Poland.\u201d\n\u201cI will support any sanctions that are offered,\u201d said Vladimir Dzhabarov, first deputy chairman of the Committee for Foreign Affairs of the Upper Chamber of the Parliament.\nIn 2016, Poland\u2019s share in Russia\u2019s international trade was about 3.2 percent, amounting to approximately $9.1 billion. Poland is Russia\u2019s 11th most important trade partner.\nRussia\u2019s Foreign Ministry reported that Russia was preparing \u201casymmetrical measures\u201d to punish Poland, including sanctions against Polish politicians involved in drafting the law, economic measures and active work on various international platforms to draw attention to this problem, reported influential Russian newspaper Izvestiya.\nAll Polish politicians who took part in drafting and passing the law will be banned from Russia.\nRussia\u2019s Ministry of Defense immediately reacted by releasing newly declassified documents from the liberation of Poland from the Nazis by the Soviet Army in 1944.\nThe Upper Chamber of the Russian Parliament called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to react on the new Polish law. So far, Putin has been silent, but there is no doubt he will have a reaction. In 2009, standing beside Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Putin unceremoniously shrugged off Tusk\u2019s efforts to blame the USSR for causing World War 11. Putin said, \u201cOnly for the liberation of the town of Gdansk, more than 53,000 soldiers and officers of the Red Army gave their lives.\u201d\nIt was not an accident that Putin chose Gdansk\u2014formerly the German city Danzig\u2014as an example of a site liberated from the Nazis.\nPutin continued, \u201cThere are more than 600,000 of my countrymen buried in Polish ground that helped to achieve victory over Nazism.\u201d\nKonstantin Kosachiov, the head of the Committee for Foreign Affairs of the Upper Chamber of Russian Parliament, supports \u201cmirror actions\u201d against the Poles. For example, he said Russia could stop taking care of Polish memorials in Russia as soon as the Polish law takes effect.\nOne such memorial is the Katyn Memorial, which is not far from the city of Smolensk, a sacred place for Poland. In 1940, Stalin\u2019s NKVD executed around 22,000 Polish officers, priests and intellectuals. Four and a half thousand thousand Polish prisoners were shot in the forest alone.\nDuring World War II, when the Nazi army advanced deep into Russia, the Nazis found the mass graves of the Polish victims. They used the gruesome discovery for their anti-Soviet propaganda machine.\nAdding further tragedy to the site, on April 10, 2010, the plane of Polish President Lech Kaczynski, who flew to Katyn to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the massacre, crashed near the Katyn forest, killing the 96 people onboard\u201488 passengers and eight crew members.\nKosachiov\u2019s suggestion that the site of these misfortunes could be added to the general list of Polish memorial places indicates Russia will take little care in distinguishing between Polish memorials.\nIn fact, Russia\u2019s answer for the coming law on the demolition of the monuments to the Soviet soldiers in Poland had been prepared well in advance.\nIn April, Warsaw made known to Moscow its displeasure with the proposal of a new addition to the Katyn Memorial Complex.\nNewly erected information stands, in front of the Katyn Museum Complex, dedicated to the \u201ctragic episodes of the Soviet-Polish war of 1919-21,\u201d became the harbingers of the coming international confrontation.\nDuring this inglorious war, which was started by the Bolsheviks to spread communism to Poland, Soviet Russia was devastatingly defeated by the Polish army. Thousands of Red Army POWs were held in Polish concentration camps in inhumane conditions with no food, clothes or shelter. Tuchola concentration camp at the time was called a death camp. Twenty-two-thousand Red Army soldiers starved to death there.\nOut of 157,000 Red Army POWs, only 75,000 survived the 20-month-long internment in Poland. The rest died of hunger, disease, torture and murder.\n\u201cThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs took with great concern and disappointment the placement by the Russian side of the massifs in the territory of the Polish military cemetery in the Katyn, containing false information about the Bolshevik prisoners in 1919-1921 who died in captivity in Poland,\u201d the Polish Foreign Ministry said.\nThe Polish Foreign Ministry claimed that the displayed information \u201cexceeded the factual data several times\u201d and \u201cthe cause of deaths of the majority of the prisoners was due to the conditions in the camps,\u201d which were the result of the \u201cdramatic economic situation\u201d in Poland and \u201ceffected both the Soviet soldiers and Polish citizens.\u201d\nMikhail Miagkov, head of the Russian Military Historical Society, said the \u201cnew and improved\u201d museum complex devoted to the Russo-Polish relations in the 20th century will be open in December 2017. \u201cAfter all,\u201d he added, \u201cthere are discussions with regards to our Red Army men, whom the Polish authorities put in concentration camps [during the war of 1919-21]. Speaking of Katyn, we must remember that not only the Polish troops, but also Soviet citizens are buried there.\u201d\nRussian Minister for Culture Vladimir Medinsky described his perspective for the new addition to the Katyn Memorial: \u201cThere will be discussions about Poland as part of the Russian Empire, about the revolutionary movement in Poland, the Soviet-Polish war, the tragedy of tens of thousands of the Red Army soldiers who were captured in Poland and tragically killed [in Polish concentration camps], about the relationship between Poland and Soviet Russia until the outbreak of World War II.\u201d\nPolish Prime Minister Jaroslaw Gowin said, \u201cThis is an obvious provocation, an attempt to equate the situation of military conflict between the two states with the situation of genocide, the brutal massacre of thousands of Polish officers.\u201d\nMedinsky said visitors of the complex would learn about the causes and consequences of these events and be provided with different points of view on what happened there.\nThis is the ultimate insult and why Poles are calling for revenge.\nFirst, some in Russia deny their country\u2019s responsibilities for the Katyn massacre. They blame it on Hitler and insist the documents were falsified under Gorbachev rule to please anti-Stalinist forces both in Russia and abroad. During the war, Stalin accused Nazis of perpetrating the execution of the Poles at Katyn and sending a special commission led by Nikolai Burdenko to cover-up the crime. Then, some Russians insist that the Polish officers shot at Katyn by the NKVD received their rightful punishment for taking part in the subjugation of Byelorussians and Ukrainians after parts of the former Russian empire went to Poland after World War I.

(Wong Maye-E\/AP)\nThe National Security Agency has linked the North Korean government to the creation of the WannaCry computer worm that affected more than 300,000 people in some 150 countries last month, according to U.S. intelligence officials.\nThe assessment, which was issued internally last week and has not been made public, is based on an analysis of tactics, techniques and targets that point with \u201cmoderate confidence\u201d to North Korea\u2019s spy agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau, according to an individual familiar with the report.\nThe assessment states that \u201ccyber actors\u201d suspected to be \u201csponsored by\u201d the RGB were behind two versions of WannaCry, a worm that was built around an NSA hacking tool that had been obtained and posted online last year by an anonymous group calling itself the Shadow Brokers.\n[NSA officials worried about the day its potent hacking tool would get loose. Then it did.]\nIt was the first computer worm to be paired with ransomware, which encrypts data on victims\u2019 computers and demands a ransom to restore access.\nWannaCry was apparently an attempt to raise revenue for the regime, but analysts said the effort was flawed. Though the hackers raised $140,000 in bitcoin, a form of digital currency, so far they have not cashed it in, the analysts said. That is likely because an operational error has made the transactions easy to track, including by law enforcement.\nAs a result, no online currency exchange will touch it, said Jake Williams, founder of Rendition Infosec, a cybersecurity firm. \u201cThis is like knowingly taking tainted bills from a bank robbery,\u201d he said.\n[Clues point to possible North Korean involvement in massive ransomware attack]\nThough the assessment is not conclusive, the preponderance of the evidence points to Pyongyang. It includes the range of computer Internet protocol addresses in China historically used by the RGB, and the assessment is consistent with intelligence gathered recently by other Western spy agencies. It states that the hackers behind WannaCry are also called \u201cthe Lazarus Group,\u201d a name used by private-sector researchers.\nOne of the agencies reported that a prototype of WannaCry ransomware was found this spring in a non-Western bank. That data point was a \u201cbuilding block\u201d for the North Korea assessment, the individual said.\nThe linkage shows that despite the Obama and Trump administrations\u2019 efforts to deter North Korean aggression, the country does not appear to have been discouraged from launching one of the most wide-ranging cyberattacks the world has seen.\n\u201cWhat it really confirms is that . . . you don\u2019t have to be the best in the business to cause a lot of disruption,\u201d said Michael Sulmeyer, director of the cybersecurity project at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what they showed they were willing and able to do.\u201d\nThe NSA declined to comment.\nNorth Korea is one of the world\u2019s most isolated countries, with very little computer infrastructure. Yet it has managed to deploy cyber capabilities to harass and annoy its rival, South Korea, and to generate revenue for the authoritarian regime.\nLast year, security researchers identified North Korea as the culprit behind a series of cyber-enabled heists of banks in Asia, including one in Bangladesh that netted more than $81 million by manipulating the bank\u2019s global payments messaging system.\nThe fact of a nation-state using cyber tools to rob banks, then-NSA Deputy Director Richard Ledgett said in March, represented \u201ca troubling new front in cyberwarfare.\u201d He did not name North Korea, but the allusion was clear. \u201cThis is a big deal,\u201d he said.\nNorth Korea in 2014 hacked Sony Pictures Entertainment and demanded that the movie studio pull a film that satirized the country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong Un. The hackers disabled computers and released embarrassing company emails. But what tipped the scale for President Barack Obama was the threat to do more damage if the studio did not yank the movie \u2014 a move that the administration viewed as an assault on free speech. The administration publicly blamed Pyongyang for the attack and imposed new economic sanctions on the regime.\nThe NSA cyber tool at the base of WannaCry was an exploit dubbed EternalBlue by the agency. It took advantage of a software flaw in some Microsoft Windows operating systems and enabled an attacker to gain access to those computers.\nAlthough Microsoft, after being notified by the NSA, issued a patch for the software flaw in March, many companies around the world and some in the United States failed to update their machines and fell victim to the virus. Michael Daniel, president of the Cyber Threat Alliance, a nonprofit group devoted to improving cyberdefenses through data sharing, said there were a \u201creasonable number\u201d of victims in the United States.\nMicrosoft declined to comment for this report.\nWilliams, who has closely studied the code, said he is convinced that the ransomware accidentally got loose in a testing phase. That would explain some of its shortcomings, such as an inability for the attacker to tell who has paid the ransom or not, he said.\nNonetheless, he said, \u201cthis is a case where you\u2019ve got a weaponized, government-sponsored exploit [or hacking tool] being used to deliver ransomware. If North Korea goes unchecked with this, I would expect other developing nations to follow suit. I think that would change the cyberthreat landscape quite a bit.\u201d\nDaniel, who was Obama\u2019s cybersecurity coordinator, said there needs to be \u201ca broad-based approach to deterring North Korea across the board\u201d in the physical world and in cyberspace.\nFederal prosecutors have been probing North Korea\u2019s role in the Bangladesh bank theft, and indictments could be issued. The Justice Department in recent years has used indictments as a tool to try to hold accountable hackers from other nation states, including China and Iran.\nRep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, has said that the Obama administration\u2019s response to North Korea after the Sony attack was not bold enough. \u201cI . . . think the Russians were watching and decided that, well, we didn\u2019t respond to that. They could get away with a cyberattack,\u201d he said at a recent public discussion with Washington Post columnist David Ignatius.\nWhen the South Koreans want to respond to North Korea, Schiff said, they use a form of information warfare. \u201cThey do it with loudspeakers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey do it by telling people in the North what a terrible regime they live under that\u2019s starving their own people.\u201d"}

That many readers no longer blanch at this agricultural metaphor\u2014indeed they expect it\u2014is a mark of how far the technique of mass vehicular homicide has spread. The alleged driver does not appear to have anything to do with the Islamic State, with whom the corpse-plow is now most associated. But of course we all waited (or rather, some of us did) to discover whether his name was Muslim, and we were ready to deploy our opinions to the crime scene, depending on the result. In fact the alleged driver turns out to be a Canadian of likely Armenian descent, and sympathetic not to ISIS but, according to a Facebook post the company confirmed to be from the suspect\u2019s since-deleted account, to \u201cincels,\u201d short for \u201cinvoluntarily celibate.\u201d Incels, mostly male, want to have sex but find no willing partners. They often resent the sexually active for spurning them. In 2014, in Santa Barbara, a 22-year-old killed six people, two of them Tri Delta sorority women, as \u201cretribution\u201d (his word, in a manifesto) for his celibate misery. The Toronto police added that yesterday\u2019s van suspect might be \u201cmentally ill,\u201d and by implication defective not in morals but in mind. The evidence we see now points to pure violent sexual frustration. That is most definitely a moral impairment and I advise against being alone in a room with anyone who suggests that it is not.\nIt\u2019s important to sympathize with the sexless, if not the sexless murderer. Like most things, sex is harder to appreciate when it\u2019s available. In that way, for some, sexual fulfillment is a bit like nutritional fulfillment: A normal day of eating will keep you comfortable enough to think about other things, but fast for a day and your gut will soon become a permanent gnawing distraction. (Ramadan, the Muslim month of daytime fasting, starts next month. Part of the idea is to reacquaint oneself with hunger, and cultivate sympathy for those for whom it is not a choice.) Total long-term involuntary celibacy, because of physical disability or moral or physical repulsiveness or something else, is clearly a preoccupying annoyance, and worse for being the kind of thing you can expect to be mocked for admitting. To have a sex life of some sort seems to me a human right. It\u2019s claiming the right to another person\u2019s sex, or retribution if it is denied, that crosses from an exercise of one\u2019s own humanity to an infringement on someone else\u2019s, in a form of slavery. And that is something the Toronto killer and his ISIS fellow plowmen share: a belief that whole classes of people have no unalienable value of their own. (ISIS actually instituted sex slavery, modeled on the sex slavery practiced by the Prophet Muhammad. Estimates of the total number of ISIS sex slaves do not exceed the low thousands\u2014mostly Yazidis, but possibly including the American aid worker Kayla Mueller.) These criminals have a common but not generic variety of wickedness, with many antecedents in history. Some might find consolation in noticing that we have seen this type of murder before. And there is undeniable solace in noting, as Steven Pinker has, that such episodes of cruelty and violence happen less than they used to, as the civilizing process has conditioned us to reject them in ourselves. The fact that the Toronto police officer who arrested the driver did so without shooting him is itself a sign of barbarism\u2019s retreat."}

'I stood in times square in a bikini and posed for a photo shoot. In the beginning I felt really overwhelmed. Not because I was mocked, but because I was so extremely sexualized by a few men who were watching.'\nShocking: Plus-size blogger Anna O'Brien shared her horror over the 'sick' sexual comments made about her body while she posed in a bikini in Times Square\n'Scary': The 33-year-old said she was prepared for some people to 'mock' her, but admitted that the crude sexual things people said to her 'made me sick to my stomach'\nShe went on to explain that the behavior of the male passersby was made all the more shocking by the fact that she was standing next to 'two nearly nude women covered only with body paint' who seemed to receive none of the crude 'yelling and screaming' that she did.\n'But to me, a plus woman in a swimsuit, the things that were said were so graphic it made me sick to my stomach,' she wrote. 'One man said he felt justified in saying what he did because \u201cplus women don\u2019t know they\u2019re ****able.\u201d'\nAnna further detailed some of the grossly sexual comments she received in a piece for Cosmopolitan, revealing that one man claimed he wanted to 'suck on them tasty toes,' while another told her to, 'Twerk for the camera baby, show them how that a** clap.'\n'Tears began to well up,' the blogger recalled. 'I was prepared to be pointed at, shamed, and called fat. I didn't expect to be fetishized.'\nThe Cleveland native even notes in the piece that posing in Times Square was her idea; the photo shoot took place at the request of a German news channel, RTL, however Anna chose the busy location because she 'wanted to be seen' and for people to realize that 'I am more than my body and I deserve respect and human decency'.\nAnna's shoot took place as a result of a viral story that made headlines around the world in April, when she publicly lambasted a Las Vegas hotel after being told to 'cover up' by staff while posing for a picture in her bikini, despite being surrounded by other women who were wearing far less.\nMaking a change: Anna explained that it was her idea to do the Times Square shoot in such a crowded, public place because she really wanted to push the envelope and 'be seen'\nHitting back: In April, the Cleveland native made headlines when she slammed a Las Vegas hotel for telling her to 'cover up' as she posed in a bikini - despite other women wearing far less\n'I find it ironic that I\u2019ve taken photos in swimsuits all over the world and the one place I was told to cover up was Las Vegas,' she said at the time, while sharing a picture of herself in her bikini on Instagram.\n'Sure, thin girls in thongs and pasties are A OK but a plus girl in a full coverage suit, trying to take an epic editorial shot- now that\u2019s just too much,' she captioned a shot of her posing in an ornately decorated hallway while wearing a leopard print bikini.\nBut despite dealing with nasty, body-shaming comments in the past, Anna was stunned at the behavior of the passersby in Times Square, particularly when one man grabbed her by the wrist - and then attempted to justify his harassment by claiming he was simply 'showing love for a BBW [big beautiful woman]' and telling her to 'show off for her fans'.\nIronically, Anna admitted that she was actually relieved when one man did walk past and 'grimace' at her, before making an 'uninspired fat joke' while 'grinning proudly'.\n'Little did he know he'd just done me a favor by silencing the other men and causing a distraction,' she wrote in her Cosmopolitan piece. 'A crowd fully formed after that, and the men who had made the lewd comments remained relatively silent.'\nThroughout the remainder of the shoot however, one man continued to film her on his phone, 'holding his camera up at the perfect height to capture my backside'. And while she tried to ignore his presence, Anna admitted that she felt 'humiliated' by his behavior.\nPushing it: Although she's happy to push boundaries, Anna also shared that she's frequently subjected to criticism online\n'I was faceless to him,' she recalled. 'I was just a body he wanted to exploit and use.

Another person said Richards was banging a shovel on the ground and speaking to herself.\nZimmerman said the call was generated as \u201cSTAR Protocol\u201d which stands for supervisor\u2019s tactic for armed subject response. He said this type of response includes a minimum of three officers and a supervisor. They are dispatched if there is credible information that a person is armed and the person is acting in a threatening manner with a weapon.\nA caller informed dispatchers that Richards struck a vehicle and that the vehicle belongs to her boyfriend, who works as a security guard at a nearby business. By 10:18 p.m. the caller\u2019s boyfriend arrived at the scene. The pair confronted Richards, who swung the shovel at them and missed, Zimmerman said.\n[RELATED: Las Vegas police name officer who allegedly shot woman 'acting erratically' with shovel ]\nAt 10:20 p.m. Officer Ondre Wills of Las Vegas Metro police arrived at the scene and saw Richards in the street with the shovel.

Richards eventually moved towards the victims with the shovel and Wills fired seven times at her, police said.\n\"Ma'am, if you take one more step, I will shoot you. If you take one more step, I will shoot you!\" Wills yelled. \"Drop the shovel! Ma'am, what's going on?

He also noted that a shovel can be considered a deadly weapon, depending on the situation.\n\"He was engaged with her at a close distance, and he felt that she was closing the distance, at least from the video,\" Zimmerman said. \"It's just like a baseball bat could, but anything you could be struck with, if you're stuck in the head with a baseball bat it could be considered deadly force.\"\nWills called for a medical response. At that time, another officer arrived at the scene and attempted to put a tourniquet on Richards but she bit the officer\u2019s hand.

The updated policy came in the wake of a CNN investigation into sexual assaults and abuse by ridesharing drivers.\nBut the company said, per its terms of service, it will not allow victims of sexual assault and harassment to join together in a class action lawsuit. Uber's lawyers tried to compel the women to carry out two of the lawsuit claims through arbitration. The claims are related to unfair business practices and consumer legal remedies. Uber said assault related claims need to be handled individually.\nRelated: Uber says no to class action lawsuits in rider assault cases -- but it's up to court to decide\nThe victims' lawyers formally pushed back in a Northern California district court on Tuesday evening. They filed a brief arguing the case benefits the public -- not the victims -- and therefore violates California law.\nMoreover, the lawyers argue Uber is hiding the magnitude of the issue by forcing survivors to litigate assault and harassment related claims on an individual basis -- something that's cost prohibitive for many.\nAttorney Jeanne Christensen of Wigdor LLP, who is representing the victims, said that at the same time the company issued its announcement, \"its lawyers were busy filing a motion to compel to arbitration all of the other claims in the lawsuit.\"\n\"If successful, Uber achieves the result it wanted all along -- to silence female victims' voices on a collective basis,\" Christensen said in a statement sent to CNN. \"Such a result also allows Uber to keep secret the data about the countless other incidents of sexual assault by Uber drivers.\"\nIn a conversation earlier this month, Uber's chief legal officer Tony West told CNN the company wants to be more transparent about sexual violence numbers. \"We want people to acknowledge the enormity of the issue, and we want us to begin to think of constructive ways to prevent and end sexual assault.\"\n\"What's most important is for individual survivors to be able to tell their individual stories,\" he added.\nThe new court filing also notes that at least two of the women represented in the lawsuit did not order the Uber rides -- someone else did. Therefore, they aren't bound by the arbitration clause, it states.\nUber is one of several ridesharing companies called on by lawmakers to turn over data related to sexual violence on its platform following CNN's investigation\nNine members of Congress sent a letter to the CEOs of Uber, Lyft, Juno, Curb, and Via last week requesting details about their protocols related to sexual assault and harassment reports, training drivers, and more.\nThe letter asks if the companies maintain records on drivers who've been accused of sexual violence and do they make that information public. It also wants to know if the companies have protocols in place to alert other ridesharing companies if drivers on their platform are reported for harassment or discrimination. Drivers often work for multiple companies."}

The 21st Century Fox CEO also has to worry about his seat on the board of electric car maker Tesla, with multiple proxy adviser groups pushing against his re-election.\nMurdoch has been on Tesla\u2019s board since July of last year, and is up for reelection at the company\u2019s shareholder meeting next Tuesday. Resistance against his re-election started to build when CtW Investment Group, a proxy advisory group that works with union-affiliated pension funds, told investors to vote against the reelection of Murdoch and two other Tesla board members.\nIn its letter to investors released earlier this month, CtW argued that Murdoch didn\u2019t have any manufacturing experience, and also noted past News Corp. scandals like the 2011 News of the World phone hacking scandal, and the more recent fallout over sexual harassment at Fox News.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that CtW often acts as an activist investor group, frequently pushing for board and policy changes at companies like Amazon, Equifax, and Bank of America.

Investment advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services also came out against having Murdoch on Tesla\u2019s board this month, telling investors that the chief Fox exec was too busy with his own company, and already \u201coverboarded\u201d with too many seats on other companies\u2019 boards, according to a recent Reuters report. Also pushing against Murdoch\u2019s reelection is proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis.\nFor its part, Tesla is backing the reelection of Murdoch. The company told stockholders in a proxy filing last month that his executive and board experience as well as his \u201cextensive knowledge of international markets and strategies, and experience with the adoption of new technologies\u201d made him a great candidate.\nMurdoch was briefly quizzed about Tesla during his appearance at Recode\u2019s Code conference in Southern California this week, where an attendee wanted to know his thoughts about Tesla CEO Elon Musk\u2019s recent anti-media outbursts, which were prompted by critical stories about the company\u2019s labor practices as well as autopilot-related accidents.\nWithout specifically commenting on any of those subjects, Murdoch argued that media isn\u2019t perfect, and that it was ultimately Musk\u2019s call how to respond to critical coverage."}

At least one Nepalese man was removed from his accommodation in the middle of the night last week, they said.\n\"They told me and others that if you go back voluntarily you will get money about US$20,000, if you guys go in group you will get more money,\" detainee Mohammad Bilal, a crane driver who says he fled Bangladesh for political reasons, told Reuters about a meeting with Australian officials last week.\nOffering money to failed asylum seekers to return home is not illegal. However, the sums being offered by Australian officials have more than doubled since a year ago, and are far above the funds being offered elsewhere.\nGermany, for example, recently announced plans to offer up to 1,200 euros (US$1,275) to asylum seekers to voluntarily return home.\n\"Substantial assistance packages are available to help non-refugees depart voluntarily, return home and re-establish their lives in their home country,\" Australia's immigration department said in an emailed statement to Reuters. \"In cases where non-refugees refuse to depart voluntarily, the government of PNG has indicated that it will enforce the removal of those individuals, in accordance with normal international practice.\"\nThe department declined to comment in more detail.\nAustralia does not reveal the cost of its offshore processing program. However, a 2016 report from Unicef and Save the Children estimated the policy had cost AUS$10 billion (US$7.7 billion) over the previous three years.\nDOUBTS ON U.S. DEAL\nThe Papua New Guinea Supreme Court last year ruled the Manus Island centre, which houses around 860 men, breached human rights and was illegal, adding pressure on Australia to find a new solution.\nBut U.S. President's Donald Trump's immigration ban has thrown doubt over a swap deal agreed in the final months of the previous administration.\nThe United States committed to take up to 1,250 asylum seekers being held on behalf of Australia on Manus and Nauru, another Pacific island nation. In return, Australia will take refugees from Central America.\nThe deal sparked a rare diplomatic spat between the two allies, with Trump berating Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull before reluctantly agreeing to honour the deal, subject to \"extreme vetting\" of would-be refugees.\nWhile the numbers of asylum seekers trying to reach Australia pale in comparison to those flooding into Europe, losing the U.S. deal would be a major set-back for Turnbull. His centre-right coalition came to power on policies that deny any asylum seeker trying to reach Australia by boat from ever being allowed to settle there.\nOFFERING CASH\nThere are 225 men on Manus currently eligible for deportation as so-called \"double negatives\" - people who have twice had their refugee claims rejected.\nBangladeshi and Nepalese detainees are being targeted for both deportation and voluntary return, human rights advocates and lawyers said, because Iran does not accept deported citizens and international law prevents the return of people to war torn countries such as Syria and Afghanistan. Nationals from Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Myanmar are also held in the centre.\nBangladeshi detainee Mohammad Rasel told Reuters he was offered US$19,500 to return to Bangladesh voluntarily, more if he convinced a group of his countrymen to go with him, during interview with an Australian Border Force official on Manus last Tuesday.\nAnother detainee who requested anonymity told Reuters that ABF officials met with a group of twelve Nepalese men on Friday, telling them they could either accept an offer of between US$10,000 and US$25,000 to go home voluntarily, or be deported.\nLawyers and refugee advocates have raised concerns about process.\n\"The increased focus by the Australian and PNG governments on deporting people with negative protection assessments is deeply troubling,\" said Sanmati Verma, a lawyer at Clothier Anderson Immigration Lawyers who represents several people on Manus and Nauru. \"All of the circumstances indicate that those people have never had their claims for protection fairly, legally or impartially assessed.\"\nThe Papua New Guinea government did not respond to emailed and telephoned requests for comment on its refugee assessment practices.\nSally Thompson from Refugee Rights Action Network said long delays before processing began seriously compromised detainees' mental health and many were afraid to speak freely before the migration agents supplied by the Australian government.\n\"Those with final negative assessments from PNG Immigration have been unable to access pro bono lawyers with standing in PNG Courts who can challenge these decisions on procedural grounds,\" she said.\n(US$1 = 1.3043 Australian dollars)\n(Additional reporting by Serajul Quadir in DHAKA; Writing by Jane Wardell; Editing by Lincoln Feast)"}

{"id":"08300717-e111-4018-99e2-45498f9fa3e6","text":"Perhaps the toughest question for the Miami Dolphins this offseason revolves around left tackle Branden Albert. He turns 33 next season, which isn\u2019t too old for a good tackle. And Albert is good. He\u2019s also a great veteran presence. He helps the younger players.\nThat\u2019s what makes this such a dilemma.\nAlbert also hasn\u2019t played a full season since 2010 with Kansas City. The last three seasons, he\u2019s played nine, 14 and 12 games. Some of this is due to major injury \u2013 in 2014 he blew out his knee. This past season he missed four games due to an ankle sprain, food poisoning and a wrist injury. He played the final weeks with a cast on his wrist. Beyond that, only the Dolphins really know how much and hard he practiced and to what degree he was rested in weeks. The bottom line here is the body doesn't get healthier in football as it ages.\nSo here\u2019s the dilemma for an offensive line that already has another fragile player in center Mike Pouncey: Do you accept Albert playing perhaps, what, 12 games in 2017? Or do you move second-year player Laremy Tunsil to his natural left tackle position and buy a younger, healthier guard to play beside Tunsil for the next several years?\nTough call.\nMaybe there's some middle ground. Maybe Albert would accept a re-done deal. But that would probably involved taking a second year, which would had added ramifications.\nIf the contract remains as is, I grit my teeth, take that $7.2 million cap savings from releasing Albert and get a younger, healthier guard, as I wrote in my column about my 10 off-season steps. I wanted to expound a little on the reasons why here. Essentially, Tunsil needs to get to left tackle, if not this year then next year when Albert\u2019s contract is done. But the key here is you can set the left side of the line up for the next several years while decreasing the odds having to juggle the line again in 2017.\nSee who draft analysts have the Miami Dolphins taking with the 22nd pick in the 2017 NFL Draft on April 27.\nEveryone knows what happened last year when the offensive line was healthy. The season took off. When intact starting in Week 6, it helped the offense put up dominant numbers \u2013 180.3 yards rushing for the next four games while yielding just three sacks.\nRyan Tannehill\u2019s injured knee underlines the importance of the line. He was hit so much his first four years with no major injury that the real cost of a problematic line went unstated.\nSo who to get? I'm just throwing out names from the list. Kevin Zeitler of Cincinnati is the top free-agent guard - but he's played on the right side all his career. Ditto Detroit's Larry Warford. So Dallas' Ronald Leary might be the guy. He started until the Cowboys drafted La'el Collins (and did well in replacing an injured Collins this year.\nIs he good enough to replace Albert?\nAnother option: Buying one of those talented right guards. Because you're looking for an upgrade over Jermon Bushrod in the off-season. Maybe Kraig Urbik, who ended the season as center for Pouncey. Maybe they find another smaller-priced free agent. Or maybe this is where they'd take the savings from Alberrt.\nAll this goes against my building philosophy to invest in guards. I typically want to spend that money on make-a-difference positions. But this line enters the season, as presently constituted, with health questions at center and left tackle. To get away from that, they can take the money for Albert and buy a productive guard for the next several years. Tough call. But I\u2019d do that.\n2. What does Pat Riley think of this Heat team? We\u2019re going to find out before the trade deadline, as I wrote in my recent column. He obviously doesn\u2019t think Serge Ibaka would add much. That\u2019s because Ibaka went to Toronto for a low cost \u2013 a No. 1 pick (low-20s, probably) and pedestrian swingman Terrence Ross. If you get Ibaka, you\u2019re signing him to a deal. Because the team he\u2019s with gets Larry Bird Rights, he goes for an $18 million cap hold rather than the sticker price of the contract ($24 million?). Obviously, Riley didn\u2019t offer more than Toronto\u2019s low price to trade for Ibaka. We\u2019ll see what he does \u2013 if anything \u2013 to add to this team coming up. As I wrote on Monday, I like what this team has done but wouldn\u2019t overestimate these pieces.\n3. Any Claude Julien rumors to the Panthers can stop now that Montreal hired him as coach.\n4. With Ibaka gone, the next Heat trade whisper is for Denver\u2019s 6-10 forward Danilo Gallinari.\n5. Marlins players again can have facial hair? Welcome back to the new millennium."}

(Photo: Cindy Ingram, Special to the USA Today Network)\nDogs were a big part of Mona Reed Fordham's childhood in West Monroe.\n\u201cMy family had all kinds of animals, but we always had dogs, and they were like family,\" said Fordham, obedience training director for Ouachita Valley Dog Training Club. \"They lived in the house and went to work with us every day.\u201d\nBut her involvement in dog training didn't come until after she acquired a German shepherd puppy in 1998.\n\u201cIt all started with wanting my new puppy to have good house manners,\u201d she said. \u201cI enrolled in a beginner obedience class with the Ouachita Valley Dog Training Club in the spring of 1998, and I guess the bug bit.\u201d\nIn short order, the trainers for the organization convinced her to show her dog Max in the club obedience trials.\n\u201cSince then, I have had several German shepherds that I have enjoyed showing in obedience and rally events,\u201d she said. \u201cMy best friend and companion at this time is Quad, a a bi-color European breed German shepherd.\"\nWhile she and Quad participate in obedience and rally events, they recently moved into some different areas of dog sports. They train and show in sheep herding and dock diving, a sport in which dogs jump for distance or height from a dock into a body of water.\nIn addition to her love of German shepherds, Fordham also has an affinity for her community.\nShe became involved in Camp Quality, an organization providing children with cancer and their families year-round programs, experiences and companionship, through the Twin Cities Rotary Club.\n\u201cOur club helps by providing a meal one evening during the camp,\" she said. \"My niece has been a companion for the last two years. This past year, I was asked to bring my German shepherd, Quad, and give a short talk to the campers and companions on responsible dog ownership and to show the fun things you can do with your dogs.\nMona Reed Fordham gives a demonstration of her German shepherd Quad's abilities at Camp Quality. (Photo: Cindy Ingram, Special to USA Today Network Louisiana)\n\"Believe me, they were way more entertained with interacting with Quad than hearing me talk, and Quad was happy for all the attention and the treats he received.\u201d\nFordham also has become involved with quilting groups.\nShe doesn't consider herself a quilter because of the steep learning curve for quilt-making techniques, but she enjoys it.\nFordham said she's always admired a quilt top her maternal grandmother made. It has a hand-pieced hexagon pattern \u2018Grandmothers Flower Garden\u2019 she has always wanted to see completed but hasn't had the 'nerve' to attempt.\nQuad, Mona Reed Fordham's German shepherd, spends time with children at Camp Quality. (Photo: Cindy Ingram, Special to the USA Today Network)\n\u201cI never did get into sewing when I was young, but I did a lot of scrapbooking and other crafts. One day, I was on the phone with a friend, and she said that she and another friend were going to the lake to sew for the weekend. Honestly, I invited myself. I packed up my little machine that my dad had bought me several years before that had never been used and headed to the lake.\n\"I had roughed out a project that I was going to work on, but my friends had to show me how to thread the machine and fill the bobbin before I could get started. I came away from that weekend with a completed T-shirt quilt and some completed blocks of my first pieced quilt.\u201d\nSince then, Fordham has completed several quilts and noted that she had tons of fun with learning the craft and creating the quilts.\nA quilt by Mona Reed Fordham. (Photo: Courtesy photo)\n\u201cMy latest quilt project is a Lone Star pattern,\u201d she said. \u201cI am in the process of deciding what borders I want to add to complete the top.\u201d\nFordham said the current patterns are not that different from the old patterns.\n\u201cThere are many, many different block \u2018patterns,' but a small twist or change to a block can give a quilt an entirely different look,\u201d she said. \u201cEven the color choices can change the look of a pattern.\n\"I have made two quilted table cloths for my dining room table. It is a large table, and I have managed to maneuver the patterns to fit the table. I must admit, I pieced the tops and bottoms, and the Quilt-N-Stitch (in West Monroe) quilted them for me on the long arm machine.\n\u201cWhile I don\u2019t think quilting is a lost art, I do think it remains something that many people do not experience and appreciate until they are a bit older,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I was in high school, our sewing class project was a poodle skirt.\"\nLooking back, Fordham said she might have been a bit more eager to sew if the project had been a quilt.\n\"It is amazing to me how a simple pieced block can be turned in different directions to create many different patterns. I learned, and I am still learning from the experience of doing as I tend to learn things by jumping in with both feet and attempting to figure it out as I go. I have also been lucky enough in life to surround myself with great friends, many with the same interests, and we all share experiences, tips, and tricks.\"\nFor those interested in attending a quilt show, the North Louisiana Quilters Guild will host its biannual show at the Monroe Civic Center on Feb. 23 and 24 presenting a unique opportunity to visit with vendors and view the beautiful quilts made by local quilters.

However, a majority of the British have believed Brexit is \u201cwrong\u201d since about summer 2017, according to YouGov\u2019s polls. Prior to that, they were marginally in favour of the EU Referendum result from 2016.\nThis chart (below) shows all those YouGov polls grouped into monthly averages. Opinion of Brexit has been negative, on average, for nine straight months:\nsource Pantheon Macroeconomics\nThe Brexit deadline is March 2019, just 10 months away. The polls suggest that as Britain goes through its historic departure from Europe, a majority of people wish it never happened.\nAt the same time, Prime Minister May\u2019s net approval rating has moved upward as she inches toward a soft Brexit, according to a moving average of opinion polls compiled by Pantheon Macroeconomics:\nsource Pantheon Macroeconomics\nPantheon analyst Samuel Tombs published the two charts next to each other in his most recent UK Chartbook, a monthly roundup of the most crucial charts on British economics.\nTombs has argued repeatedly \u2013 like a number of his colleagues in The City and on Wall Street \u2013 that the UK government will eventually cave and opt for a soft Brexit because the economic cost of crashing out of the EU would cause too much political damage to May\u2019s government. Also, a soft Brexit \u2013 in which Britain would stay in a customs union with the EU and remain close to its regulations \u2013 is the only compromise that can both command a majority in Parliament and go a long way to preserving the invisible Irish border.\nMight May\u2019s popularity be pegged to the country\u2019s newfound distaste for leaving the EU? One potential theory is that remain voters prefer May as prime minister to the hardline rivals in her party who would prefer a \u201cno deal\u201d scenario that puts the economy at risk."}

Whatever the reason, whatever the cause, how could they allow that? It just unimaginable,\" he said.\nThe strike was carried out Thursday morning against an Islamic State group tunnel complex, carved into a mountain in Nangarhar province, that Afghan forces had tried to assault repeatedly in recent weeks, according to Afghan officials.\nU.S. and Afghan forces have been battling the Taliban for more than 15 years. But the U.S. military unveiled the largest conventional bomb in its arsenal against the Islamic State group, which has a far smaller but growing presence in Afghanistan.\nU.S. President Donald Trump has publicly vowed to aggressively confront IS.\nTrump called the operation a \"very, very successful mission\" but Karzai had harsh words for the new U.S. leader.\n\"My message to President Trump today is that he has committed an immense atrocity against the Afghan people, against fellow human beings,\" he said.\n\"If the American government sees us as human beings, then they have committed a crime against fellow human beings, but if they treat us as less than human beings, well, of course they can do whatever they want.\"\nThe U.S. estimates 600-800 IS fighters are in Afghanistan, mostly in Nangarhar.

Because I have other people to run my businesses.\u201d\nJohnson spoke during the day, before the Lakers lost to the Sacramento Kings, 97-96, at Staples Center.\nJohnson has declined interview requests from local media, but he has done more than one interview nationally in which he said he wants the final say on the Lakers\u2019 basketball decisions. He has also said he wants to work alongside Jim Buss, and has sometimes said both during the same interview.\nNevertheless, the Lakers maintain that Johnson\u2019s role was clearly defined in their initial press release \u2014 he is an advisor to Jeanie Buss and any other department that seeks his consultation.\nThe Lakers do not have a president of basketball operations. Jeanie Buss is the team president, governor and a co-owner, since her father, Jerry Buss, died in 2013. She and her brother Jim are two of six siblings who each own 11% of the team. Jim Buss is the team\u2019s top basketball executive as executive vice president of basketball operations.\nJeanie Buss hired Johnson at a particularly pivotal time in her leadership. Her brother told The Times in 2014 that he planned to step down if the Lakers were not in contention for a Western Conference championship within three or four years.\nPhotos -\nWhen he said that, the Lakers were finishing a 27-55 season. They went 21-61 the next year and a franchise-low 17-65 last season.\nAs governor, Jeanie Buss has the power to remove him from his current role and has said in the past she will uphold her brother\u2019s timeline. Earlier this season, she declined to reiterate that perspective.\n\u201cI think that in my job, what my job is to make sure that I ensure the success of the franchise going forward,\u201d she said in October. \u201cWe have to, as we define success, there\u2019s no reason to speculate on what will happen this season. We have to see what happens and evaluate at the end of the season.\u201d\nThe Lakers started the season a surprising 10-10 but have struggled since. After Tuesday\u2019s loss to the Kings, they are 19-38.\nHiring Johnson seemed to signal trouble for Jim Buss.\nJohnson has been openly critical of Buss in the past on Twitter and in several interviews. The pair have not yet met to discuss their relationship, but Johnson said during an ESPN show that that would happen next week in a meeting that would also include Lakers General Manager Mitch Kupchak.\nKupchak, who is typically available to reporters before home games, declined to speak about Johnson\u2019s advisory role.\n\u201cFrom here on out it has to be one message,\u201d Johnson said on \u201cFirst Take.\u201d \u201cOne team, one voice. If it doesn\u2019t come to that, the losing continues. I can\u2019t step in between Jim and Jeanie. That\u2019s their thing. Jeanie\u2019s gotta handle that.\u201d\nStephen A. Smith, a host of the show, asked Johnson if he planned to make clear to Jeanie and Jim Buss that he wants to be the one voice of the organization.\n\u201cI will put that on the table, yes,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what comes after that.\u201d\nJohnson added that if confusion remained about the Lakers\u2019 power structure for much longer, he would leave the organization again.\nHis pitch for being the voice of the Lakers\u2019 front office included a declaration that his first call would be to Kobe Bryant to get him involved in the organization again. He also said that though the Lakers have struggled to attract free agents in the past, his presence would change that.\n\u201cIf Magic Johnson is in that seat, guys are gonna want to come play,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBecause I know business. I know how to win.\u201d\nAs the plot thickened 2,500 miles away, Lakers Coach Luke Walton endured another set of questions about Johnson\u2019s latest declarations both during shoot-around and before the Lakers played the Kings.\nWhat did Walton think about Johnson\u2019s wanting to involve Bryant?\nWalton said he\u2019s spoken to Bryant for advice since becoming the Lakers coach, but hasn\u2019t thought much about the former player\u2019s involvement beyond that.\n\u201cI\u2019m focused on coaching these guys and where we\u2019re at, and then when the time comes, Magic and I will sit down and talk,\u201d Walton said. \u201cPeople send me articles, but most of the time and effort is focused here. When someone sends me something, I\u2019ll look at it.\u201d\nCoaching is one department in which Johnson has repeatedly said he would not meddle. He tried coaching once, and didn\u2019t like it.\nVery little else seems certain about his new role.\ntania.ganguli@latimes.com\nFollow Tania Ganguli on Twitter @taniaganguli"}

Dana Rohrabacher.\nHans Keirstead, a 50-year-old Democrat from Laguna Beach, said Wednesday that he will run in the 48th Congressional District, one of more than half a dozen in California that have been targeted by Democrats seeking to harness sentiment against President Trump in their fight for a House majority.\nKeirstead\u2019s candidacy has been sought by some national Democratic figures, who see his science and business background as a good fit for the district. It runs along the Orange County coastline from Laguna Beach to Seal Beach, and includes some nearby inland cities.\nRepublicans represent a plurality of the district with more than 40% of its registration, to about 30% for Democrats. A quarter of voters are registered as nonpartisan. The Huntington Beach-based Rohrabacher, who is 69, has served in the House since 1988.\nPart of the reason for the Democratic drought in the 48th and other districts now seen as competitive has been the party\u2019s candidates; Rohrabacher last faced a serious challenge in 2008, when he won by 10 percentage points. In November, he won by more than 16 points. Hillary Clinton won the district by almost 2 points en route to becoming the first Democratic presidential nominee to win Orange County since 1936.\nSeveral other candidates already have announced their intention to run against the veteran House member.\nFollow California politics by signing up for our email newsletter \u00bb\nNationally and in California, Democrats say they have been swamped by candidates interested in running for office to oppose Trump and Republican majorities in the House and Senate. Keirstead said that is one of his motivations.\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to realize more acutely than ever before the deficits in Congress and how my profile can actually benefit Congress,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to do what I\u2019m doing but on a larger stage \u2014 and I think Congress provides that, provides a forum for doing the greater good.\u201d\nKeirstead was a pioneer in stem cell research, first in his native Canada and, since 2000, in Southern California. He helped lead UC Irvine\u2019s stem cell research program and, in his only political endeavor, served as an advisor to a successful 2004 state measure, Proposition 71, that sought to steer $3 billion into medical research.\nHe also has started and sold several medical research companies that have invented therapies for ovarian, skin and brain cancer, as well as spinal cord injuries, rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis.\nKeirstead has made millions of dollars off of his business endeavors but said he will not use his own money for his campaign.\nAlthough his background gives him a network of allies to help raise money, Keirstead is likely to face criticism for leaping into politics mid-ladder, without the relationship-building that usually precedes a first run.\nHe became a citizen in 2008, he said. County voting records show he cast ballots in general elections that year and in 2010, 2012 and 2016. The records indicate that he did not cast any ballots in the 2014 midterm elections, and he has not voted in primary elections.\nAsked about the missing votes, Keirstead said he had \u201cother commitments and responsibilities\u201d but stressed that the result of last fall\u2019s elections show \u201chow important it is to participate in our democracy.\u201d\nCampaign finance records show he has not donated to federal or state candidates.\nIn an interview, Keirstead suggested he is still studying policy positions. He said that he would prefer to improve the Obamacare insurance program rather than adopt a universal healthcare plan favored by some liberal Democrats.\n\u201cI think Obamacare put in place a very large system that is fantastic in some measures and very flawed in others,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot we can do with the existing system rather than cripple it first as the Trump administration is doing in order to justify a replacement.\u201d\nOn trade, another issue that has divided Democrats, he declined to take a position on the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump and some Democrats favor dumping. He also would not say whether he favored Clinton or Sen. Bernie Sanders last year.\n\u201cI just don\u2019t really like the labels,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to run as authentic Hans.\u2026 I am personally tired of partisan politics where the labels are driving the decision making. I think we should be more results driven.\u201d\nBut he was happy to criticize Rohrabacher for his advocacy of friendlier relations with Russia and for voting for the House Republican healthcare plan. And he also defended, with a laugh, his unorthodox path to politics.\n\u201cI can tell you without a doubt my cancer treatment, my spinal cord injury treatment, would never have been invented had I followed a step-by-step straight path in academia and business, for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cDoing things differently has been responsible for my success. And it\u2019s actually encouraged me to take on bigger initiatives like running for Congress.\u201d\nCAPTION President Donald Trump gives a commencement speech at the Coast Guard Academy in Connecticut on Wednesday.

My Camry had 235,000 miles, and other than a nasty scratch on the passenger door and a bit of paint fade, it will still in excellent shape.\n\"I kept up with everything. The oil I changed every 3,000 miles. The air filter every 15. The tranny fluid and fuel filter every 30, and the Michelin tires should last you until the odometer gets to 280,000 miles. By then you'll want to replace the belt and water pump because they will be due too.\"\nI maintained the car better than most potheads maintain their plants. That nutty guy you always see at the gas station who raises their hood and checks everything underneath before the gas gauge gets to full - that was me. No joke. The Camry was the first and only new car I ever bought. Like everyone else who plans on keeping their big ticket purchase for a lifetime I had a 20 year plan set in stone for my first car.\nBut then that earthquake called change happened and that Camry went from a daily driver to a perennial garage queen. I made a career change, from working as a painfully unhappy financial analyst who made numbers dance on a computer, to a numbers chanting auto auctioneer who traveled the country liquidating cars. I did three to four sales a week from coast to coast while my Camry took a quick weekly drive and then sat parked at a nearby airport.\nThen I started buying cars on the side. First once every month or so, then once a week, and finally well over three to four a week. Before I knew it, that Camry was parked for months on end. I was spending my free time on airplanes between auctions trying to devise Craigslist ads that would move every piece of rolling metal I now owned - other than that Camry.\nIn the summer of 2005 I watched that Camry leave my driveway for the last time. One ad. One day. One customer. That was all it took. I had twenty-five hundred dollars in my picket and the new owner had my old set of keys along with my once prized machine. 12 years later it's still on the road with over 350,000 miles.\nThat's my story.

According to them, feminism is nationalism's archenemy and is thus the best solution to the \"problem.\"\nThe growth of nationalist parties across Europe represents a major threat to all good in humanity, Feminist Initiative party leader Gudrun Schyman has claimed in a joint opinion piece penned with fellow party member Soraya Post published by Europaportalen.\nThe Feminist Initiative claims that support for parties with xenophobic and nationalist ideologies is increasing in Sweden and the rest of Europe. At present, 13 percent of all members of the European parliament are from right-wing and euro-skeptic parties, they wrote, citing Viktor Orban's nationalist Fidesz party that strives to \"preserve Hungary's homogeneity\" and the Freedom Party of Austria as the most \"blatant\" examples.\nAccording to Schyman and Post, the nationalist parties want to \"turn back the clock,\" reversing society to \"traditional roles\" for women and restrict women's right to decide over their own body.\n\"Their policies exclude ethnic and religious minorities, refugees and asylum seekers, LGBT people, feminists and human rights activists \u2014 virtually anyone who does not fit in their mall,\" Schyman and Post wrote, calling it a \"threat to our democracy and the idea of everyone's equal right to participation.\"\nAccording to Schyman and Post, nationalism affects women's rights across the EU in a negative way. Among other things, they claim, \"traditional values\" are now prioritized over gender equality throughout Europe. They single out Poland for wanting to introduce harsher abortion laws.\nThe Feminist Initiative also claimed that women's movements in the EU are increasingly suffering financing troubles, noting that women's rights activists are silenced, exposed to hatred and threatened with sexual violence.\nThe authors hinted that the threat of nationalism is currently at such a high level that Europe risks revisiting the previous experience of Nazism from the 1930's.\n\"We have already witnessed the cruel consequences of nationalism in Europe, what the 'we and them' type of rhetoric and the dehumanization of a group of people can lead to,\" Schyman and Post wrote.\nREAD MORE: Too Few Women in Power: Feminist Sweden Schools NATO on Gender Equality\nAccording to the party, democratic alternatives, anti-racist organizations and feminism, which is \"nationalism's archenemy\" are preferable solutions.\nSweden's incumbent red-green coalition government has labeled itself \"the world's first feminist\" one and never misses an opportunity to make a stand for equality and women's rights.\nThe Feminist Initiative is a self-described radical Swedish party that has advocated \"completely open borders.\" Formed in 2005, it received only 3.1 percent of the vote in the 2014 general election, falling below the electoral threshold, and has yet to enter parliament.\nBy contrast, the right-wing Sweden Democrats party from the opposite side of the political spectrum has, according to opinion polls, cemented its position as Sweden's third largest party after only traditional heavyweights the Social Democrats and the Conservatives.\nREAD MORE: Gender Bender?

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email\nThe brow furrows, the eyes narrow, the jaw tightens. The dreaded third season. Along with his well-documented record with young players, it is the one topic an exasperated Jose Mourinho hates being asked about.\nThe Portuguese readily admits he has no experience in building a dynasty because he has left clubs at the top of the mountain as far as he is concerned.\nThe reason he did not spend three full seasons at Inter and Porto? He departed on the ultimate high: upsetting the 'sharks' and winning the Champions League.\nMourinho has won a league title in each of his second seasons in charge at Porto, Chelsea (twice), Inter and Real Madrid, but that record looks set to change at United, given that they are now 11 points off top spot.\nBut will third-season syndrome strike again?\nIn his third campaign with Chelsea, the first time around, Mourinho won two cups and reached the semi-finals of the Champions League but, tellingly, his win percentage in the Premier League fell from 76.3% to 63.2%,\nThe jaded message that had changed English football, and thrust Chelsea into the big time, was just not getting to the players in the same way it had previously.\nThrow in a cluttered hierarchy, some devastating mid-season injuries and a change in the profile of players signed and the writing was on the wall. After 1,205 days in charge, his longest spell to date, it was soon over despite Mourinho having three years to run on his contract.\nAhead of his third season at Real Madrid, Mourinho signed a new four-year deal after seeing off Pep Guardiola but again league results suffered as the champions looked to defend their title. Los Blancos' win percentage dropped from 84.2% to 68.4%.\nMourinho would argue that he laid the foundations for Carlo Ancleotti and Zinedine Zidane to go on and end Madrid's long wait to dominate the Champions League again, but it was a black mark following a number of fall-outs with key players.\nThen, as he approached his third campaign in his second spell at Chelsea, after signing a new four-year deal, Mourinho afforded his squad an extra week off ahead of an uncharacteristically short pre-season following the World Cup. They never recovered.\nOff the field, Radamel Falcao and Asmir Begovic were the only notable signings before the club's first league game of the season. A botched move for John Stones set the tone for a disastrous window which culminated in the strange additions of Papy Djilobodji and Michael Hector.\nMoves are already afoot to ensure Mourinho's third season at United is not such a disaster.\nThe club's pre-season plans are underway ahead of some tricky scheduling issues with the World Cup. Club representatives visited the UCLA in October ahead of a potential return to the state of the art campus sometime between July 20 and August 5\nUp to 18 United players could play in next summer's tournament in Russia and Mourinho will be keen to ensure his team do not go into next season as undercooked as his Chelsea side were.\nThe 54-year-old constantly looks to evolve and innovate with his methodology and training sessions, and has moved away from his trusted 4-3-3 and 4-2-3-1 formations at times at United. Mourinho has even dabbled with three at the back in an attempt to keep up with the times.\nThe Portuguese has purposefully put together a young side, too, who have bought into his ideas but overturning Guardiola this time around may be even more difficult than it was in Spain.\nThe City boss is a few steps step ahead in his project- aided by an extra \u00a3100m spend last summer - and Mourinho's favoured role as underdog has not been enough to derail it. This time, at least.\nThe reality is, though, that not even the mighty Ivan Perisic would have changed the outcome of the Manchester derby.\nFinding a solution could be Mourinho\u2019s biggest test yet ahead of that dreaded third season.\nGet all the latest Manchester United news first with our new app. Download it here now"}
{"id":"accd1a73-53f9-4810-892d-bca9d0a6a574","text":"Walk down the aisle of your local pharmacy or grocery store and you'll be bombarded by a dizzying array of bleaching products, from gels and strips to paint-on bleach.\nCosmetic tooth bleaching is a $3.2 billion global industry, according to market analysts, and it's getting bigger fast. It's easy to see why. Strikingly white, bright smiles dominate TV and social media, and people tend to prefer the bright teeth of youth rather than those that have been yellowed by trauma or age.\nBut if you decide that you, too, want a brighter smile, it's hard to know where to start.\n\"I'm a dentist, but I'm also a consumer and I can certainly get confused by all the products,\" says Ruchi Sahota who practices in Fremont, Calif. A colleague of hers describes the tooth product aisle in stores as the \"dental aisle of confusion,\" because there are so many options. \"You can easily get bewildered standing there trying to figure out which option is the best,\" she says.\nThe dilemma isn't helped by regulators. Tooth whitening products don't need approval from the Food and Drug Administration before hitting the market, because the agency considers them \"cosmetic,\" a designation that's much more lightly regulated than drugs. And, the FDA says it has not determined that any ingredients contained in currently marketed products are unsafe.\nThe American Dental Association does offer some guidance in choosing a bleaching product \u2014 its ADA seal of acceptance. \"The seal is rooted in science,\" says chemist Jamie Spomer, director of the ADA's seal of acceptance program; she notes that when a manufacturer applies for the seal, an independent panel of dentists analyzes the company's data and sometimes performs studies of their own.\nThe seal is a \"symbol that an independent panel reviewed and approved the product for its safety and effectiveness,\" Spomer says. Many toothpastes carry the ADA seal. So far only one over-the-counter-bleaching product does \u2014 Crest 3D White Glamorous White Whitestrips.\nEven so, Sahota says many over-the-counter products that don't carry the seal can still be effective if used as directed. Most cause some tooth sensitivity during the bleaching process, but that goes away once the process is complete, she says. Depending on which product is used, bleaching can take anywhere from two to six weeks.\nAnd, if you're not careful, Sahota says the products can leak onto the gums, causing inflammation and \"extra sensitivity\" to pressure, temperature and touch.\nA safer but more costly option might be to buy a custom-made tray from your dentist, Sahota says. Unlike the one-size-fits-all trays sold over the counter, a dentist makes the tray \"just for you\" she says.\nThe tray hugs the teeth and ensures the gel is kept where it should be and is evenly applied. The kits cost about $400; this at-home whitening process can take up to four weeks, depending on how stained the teeth are to begin with. Generally, the trays are worn for one or two hours a day.\nIf you want an even faster route, you'll have to pay more. Bleaching in the dental office can run more than $1,000, but results are quick and more dramatic. Dentists use bleaching gels that rely on high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (up to 40 percent hydrogen peroxide, compared to a 5 to 6 percent concentration in drugstore kits and a 10 to 15 percent solution in the home-kits from dentists).\nSo the whole process in the dentist's office can take just an hour or two to complete. And because the peroxide concentrations used there are much higher, the results can be many shades lighter than with take-home kits and over-the-counter products.\nAn important caveat: Insurance companies consider in-office teeth whitening \"cosmetic\" so the procedures are almost never covered.\nNonetheless, more Americans are opting for in-office whitening. In 2015, in-office bleaching procedures rose 29 percent over the year before, according to an American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry survey. And there's at least a little evidence that the whiter the smile the more attractive the person \u2013 in a 2012 study both men and women said they prefer white teeth when choosing a mate.\nBut go to the dentist before you start bleaching, says Ada Cooper, a New York City dentist.\n\"Tooth discoloration can be caused by cavities and other oral problems,\" she says. \"It's more important to maintain healthy teeth.\"\nIt's also important to note that not all stains are the same. Some are mostly on the surface of the teeth and come from consuming lots of dark colored liquids like coffee, tea and red wine, as well as foods with vibrant yellow spices like turmeric. The tar and nicotine from cigarettes are also huge culprits. Often surface stains can be diminished by routine brushing, flossing and biannual professional cleaning in the dentist's office.\nUnfortunately, there are deeper stains you just can't avoid by being careful about what you eat and drink. These come with aging and years of chewing, which causes millions of tiny cracks in the outer enamel of the tooth. These cracks can fill up with stain. On top of that, the thinning enamel can allow the yellow core of the tooth to become more visible. Grinding teeth at night and brushing too hard can also weaken and thin tooth enamel. Bleaching agents can penetrate these deeper stains and turn the tooth whiter \u2014 typically two to seven shades lighter.\nThere are some discolorations that just can't be bleached away. Trauma to a tooth \u2014 such as a chip or break \u2014 can also permanently discolor it from the inside, and stains from ingesting the antibiotic tetracycline or large amounts of fluoride are also permanent. In these cases, the only option for whiter teeth is a crown or veneer.\nAll types of bleaching \u2014 whether over-the-counter, take-home kits or in the dental office \u2014 are temporary, requiring touch-ups at some point. As for homespun remedies promoted online, in social media and in magazines as being \"natural whitening\" agents (including charcoal, baking soda or lemon juice), the ADA says there is no evidence these methods work."}

He was 71.\nDiaz's daughter, Aillette Rodriguez-Diaz, confirmed that he died Tuesday. The cause of death wasn't immediately known.\n\"He was the king of the family,\" Rodriguez-Diaz said. \"He cared about all of his friends and colleagues. His life was photography and my mother.\"\nDiaz's wife, Martha, died nearly two years ago.\nDiaz's iconic image shows an armed U.S. immigration agent confronting the boy in the Little Havana home where he lived with relatives after being found floating off the Florida coast.\n\"Alan Diaz captured, in his iconic photographs, some of the most important moments of our generation - the bitter, violent struggle over the fate of a small Cuban boy named Elian Gonzalez, the magnified eye of a Florida election official trying to make sense of hanging chads and disputed ballots in the 2000 presidential election,\" AP executive editor Sally Buzbee said.\n\"He was gravelly-voiced and kindhearted, generous with his expertise. And like all great photographers, he was patient. He was able to wait for the moment.\"\nDiaz, who was known to roar, \"Hello, Miami,\" every time he entered the AP's South Florida office, brought the same energy and professionalism to every story, whether he was shooting an upcoming weekend feature or a World Series baseball game. His good-natured humility and unwavering focus were often calming elements for his colleagues in Florida's frequently chaotic news environment. He introduced newcomers to some of the pleasures of Miami, such as sipping a cafecito in Little Havana.\nNot one to boast about past triumphs, Diaz rarely brought up the Elian story himself, but he would usually discuss it with enough encouragement. He had been freelancing for AP in November 1999 when a boater found the Cuban boy floating in an inner tube in the waters off Fort Lauderdale. Diaz spent the next few months chatting with Gonzalez's relatives and neighbors, earning their trust by respecting an order from the boy's uncle to not speak to the child.\nBecause of those relationships, he was the only photographer to capture the moment when U.S. immigration agents ended a bitter international custody battle with a pre-dawn raid the day before Easter in 2000. The Pulitzer-winning photo shows an armed agent reaching out to toward a terrified Elian, seconds before the boy was pulled out of his uncle's home so he could be returned to his father in Cuba.\nDiaz said he was just in the right place at the right time.\nAfter the image hit the wires and network television news, Diaz saw how both Cuban leader Fidel Castro and Cuban-American community leaders used it to argue that the other side was brutal and heartless.\n\"I have no opinion on it. I shot the moment. That's all,\" Diaz said last year. \"Good or bad, that's what happened that morning.\"\nThe AP hired Diaz as a staff photographer two months after the raid, kicking off a 17-year-career with the wire service. Within months of starting, Diaz was taking photos of hanging chads during the Florida recount for the 2000 presidential election. The next year, Diaz flew to New York just days after 9\/11, when planes were allowed back in the sky, to help document the recovery. Diaz was in Florida for the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons, when storm after storm caused billions in damage across the Southeastern U.S. More recently, he rushed to Orlando in 2016 to cover another tragedy, a shooting at a gay night club that left 49 people dead.\n\"Alan Diaz will be remembered for taking one of the most iconic photographs in Miami's history,\" AP Miami photo editor Marta Lavandier said. \"But what is less known about Alan is that he was a humble, dedicated, hard-working news photographer that loved covering every aspect of his community.\"\nAfter winning the Pulitzer Prize in 2001, he was awed by the celebration from his heroes in photojournalism.\n\"Joe Rosenthal wanted to meet me? Wow,\" Diaz said, still shaking his head at being honored by the AP photojournalist who produced the iconic image of U.S. Marines and a Navy sailor raising the American flag over Iwo Jima.\nDiaz was born in New York to Cuban parents. He spent his adolescence in Cuba, where he studied photography with Alberto Korda, whose 1960 portrait of Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara became one of the most reproduced images in history.\nIn 1978, he moved to Miami and began shooting in Little Havana for Cuban-American organizations and publications. One memorable assignment was a meeting of leaders of anti-Castro efforts and Frank Sturgis, one of the Watergate burglars, who had fought alongside Castro in Cuba before turning against him.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Jennifer Kay contributed to this story.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show that U.S. immigration agents seized Elian Gonzalez on the eve of Easter 2000, not Good Friday."}

Gen. Konashenkov.\n\u201cThe F-22 launched decoy flares and used airbrakes while constantly maneuvering [near the Russian Su-25 warplanes], imitating an air fight \u2026 most close-midair encounters between Russian and US jets in the area around the Euphrates River have been linked to the attempts of US aircraft to get in the way [of the Russian warplanes] striking against Islamic State terrorists,\u201d Maj. Gen Konashenkov said, according to RT.\nMaj. Gen Konashenkov also denounced a statement made by Lieutenant Colonel Damien Pickart, a spokesman for the US Air Force Central Command, in which he claimed that the aerospace over the eastern bank of the Euphrates River belongs to the US-led coalition.\n\u201cWe saw anywhere from six to eight incidents daily in late November, where Russian or Syrian aircraft crossed into our airspace on the east side of the Euphrates River,\u201d Lt. Col. Pickart told CNN during an interview on Decembers 9.\nThe spokesman of the Russian military described Lt. Col. Pickart statement as \u201cpuzzling\u201d and stressed that Syria is a sovereign nation and a member of the UN. The general also said that the US-led coalition should focus on destroying ISIS in Iraq instead of close encounters between US and the Russian jets.\n\u201cUnlike the Russian Air Force, the US-led coalition is operating in Syria without any legal basis,\u201d Maj. Gen. Konashenkov said.\nMany Syrian experts believe that these harrassments are a part of the US plan not only to stay in Syria after defeating ISIS, but also to divide the country if possible, in a way similar to the Korean Peninsula. However, this scenario is opposed by both the Syrian government and the opposition.\nFeatured image is from South Front.\nThe original source of this article is South Front\nAdvertisements\nShare this: Share\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nLike this: Like Loading...

That is why Mayor Heather Jackson, city council and the Honours and Awards Committee are recognizing some of St. Thomas\u2019 most outstanding citizens.\nOn Thursday a banquet will be held at the Memorial Arena Auditorium to celebrate the recipients. Recipients have been chosen in 12 categories including three individual volunteers, volunteer organization, good citizen, good citizen organization, sport team provincial, sport individual national, individual culture, special contribution, recognition award and the mayor\u2019s award.\nRetired teacher Judy Upsdell has been chosen as one of three to be recognized for her volunteerism. She has been a fundraising volunteer at the Talbot Teen Centre for 12 years, starting shortly after her retirement from teaching. Volunteering is an important part of her life.\n\u201cI think that one of the most important things that anybody can do is volunteer to help out some organization, it doesn\u2019t matter what organization it is,\u201d Upsdell said.\nUpsdell started at the Talbot Teen Centre because she was a teacher for many years and was asked to come on board with a new venture that was happening in the city.\n\u201cThey had just bought the building and were just getting up and running and I said, \u2018Yes,\u2019\u201d Upsdell said.\nOver a decade into her volunteering career Upsdell said she has a lot of memorable moments but it\u2019s the times when she gets to see the teens sitting and talking with their leaders that is especially touching.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some wonderful success for some of the kids who have gone off to post-secondary education and that\u2019s been wonderful to see,\u201d Upsdell said.\nUpsdell said she loves bringing the teens to do talks at other service clubs because they always have great things to say.\n\u201cThey do a great job of it,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s just lots of wonderful things that go on there.\u201d\nUpsdell said she thinks it\u2019s kind of the committee to nominate her for the award.\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to have it (the award).

His seven-year tenure as Louis Vuitton's men's artistic director was most recently the one behind those omnipresent, hysteria-inducing luxe Supreme goods like fanny packs and backpacks, and his last few shows showcased the prominent approval from names like Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell, and Drake . (The two supers reunited to walk the runway together for Jones' last show earlier this year, marking Moss' first official runway walk since 2013, whereas Drake composed an entire new single for the soundtrack of Jones' penultimate major show.)\nThe news about Jones, who left Vuitton in mid-January, only broke shortly after the announcement that Kris Van Assche was leaving Dior Homme after 11 years at the house. Though certainly one to keep a lower profile than many influential designers, Van Assche has long been renowned for his influence within the industry, quietly celebrating a decade of making some of the most covetable menswear around just last year with new additions to his signature Hedi Slimane-style sleek suits like prom-style rosettes and short shorts. He continued departing from tradition with some more subtle risks in his final collection this past January, tapping a woman from Christian Dior's atelier to weigh in on the tailoring and taking inspiration from raves and clubs in the '90s to more specific youthful moments like \"the first tattoo you got when you were 15.\"\nLoading View on Instagram\nThough certainly having made changes in Dior Homme's direction in the last year, Van Assche posted explained in a row of three black-and-white Instagrams that he felt the \"time has come for [him] to move on to new adventures.\" Meanwhile, though only a few years younger than Van Assche, Jones, whose fans also include Tyga, will no doubt continue giving the house something of a more contemporary, younger spin. His collaboration with Supreme, for example, came about two decades after Vuitton sued the streetwear giant for essentially copying their logo, a tongue-in-cheek rebuttal hinting that behind the scenes, Jones just might be as masterful at fashion shade as Alexander Wang .\nRelated: Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell Walked the Runway Together For Kim Jones's Final Louis Vuitton Show"}

Nashville brought experience and know-how.\nIt was plain to see which won out \u2014 this time.\nMattias Ekholm ignited the offense early with the first goal by a Nashville defenseman in the series, Pekka Rinne stopped 22 shots and the top-seeded Predators advanced to the second round with a 5-0 victory over the Avalanche in Game 6 on Sunday night.\nAustin Watson , Filip Forsberg , Nick Bonino and Viktor Arvidsson also scored to help the Predators move on to face Winnipeg. They were 3-1-1 against the Jets in the regular season.\n\"I'm very impressed the way (the Avalanche) played. They played very modern hockey, with a lot of speed,\" said Rinne, who notched his fourth career postseason shutout as the Predators won the series 4-2. \"Great game. Great team effort. We didn't give them any life.\"\nNashville removed any sort of drama with two goals in the opening period and two more in the second to hush the capacity crowd. That's the sort of game plan the Predators envisioned.\n\"I think that was our best game from start to finish,\" Watson said. \"That's good for us going forward, to be able to take the last game of this series and carry that into how we want to play in the next one.\"\nAndrew Hammond ran out of magic in net, allowing five goals. The third-string goaltender nicknamed \"Hamburglar\" had 44 saves during a Game 5 win in Nashville to extend the series. But he couldn't turn back a formidable Nashville offense that won a second straight playoff contest in Denver. Before this, the Avalanche hadn't lost two straight at the Pepsi Center since early December.\n\"It's disappointing to us and I'm sure it's disappointing to fans,\" Avalanche captain Gabriel Landeskog said. \"It means a lot to us that they did give us a standing ovation at the end.\"\nWatson tormented Colorado with four goals and seven points in the series. In all, 11 of Nashville's forwards had at least a point over six games.\nThe one thing missing was contributions from a blue line that tied a franchise record for goals during the regular season. The Predators 'D' was held scoreless until Ekholm's slap shot at 7:20.\nForsberg scored 38 seconds into second to give Nashville a 3-0 lead and completely drain the energy out of the arena. Bonino added another to go with his two assists.\nThe closest Colorado came to scoring on Rinne was in the second period, when Nikita Zadorov sent in a shot, but it was waved off due to goaltender interference on Carl Soderberg.\n\"Every line that went out there took a lot of pride in playing good defense, even at the end with the game 5-0. We still protected the net,\" Rinne said. \"Guys wanted to get me that shutout.\"\nIt was quite a bounce-back season for Colorado, which boasts one of the youngest teams in the league. The Avalanche went from a 48-point team in 2016-17 to 95 points this season, earning the last playoff spot on the final day of the regular season. The Avs are the first NHL team to post that sort of turnaround from one full season to the next since Pittsburgh also jumped 47 points in 2005-06 (58) to '06-07 (105).\n\"There are a lot of positives for sure,\" said Nathan MacKinnon, who was held to one shot Sunday. \"Everybody thought we weren't going to make it, that we were going to be the odd-team-out in the West. Obviously, it's nice to prove some people wrong and have a good young team going forward.\"\nIn the handshake line after the game, Nashville coach Peter Laviolette had some encouraging words for MacKinnon.\n\"He thought our team was up-and-coming, similar to their team,\" MacKinnon recounted. \"Definitely, it's a good team to be compared to.\"\nColorado ran into a Predators squad that looked every bit like the team that went to the Stanley Cup Final a season ago and won the Presidents' Trophy this season. They're clicking on all cylinders heading into the Winnipeg series.\n\"These guys have been flying around for six games, playing really fast hockey,\" Forsberg said. \"We've been trying to play as fast as we can as well. If we can bring that speed into the next round that will be good.\"\nNOTES: The Predators improved to 6-6 all-time in a Game 6 situation. ... F Colton Sissons had two assists. ... RW Ryan Hartman was a scratch after being suspended for Game 5 for a hit on Soderberg. ... D P.K. Subban had high praise for MacKinnon: \"My expectations for him as a player is to be a Hall of Famer by the end of his career.\"\n___\nMore AP hockey: https:\/\/apnews.com\/tag\/NHLhockey"}

The bill will hike the minimum wage \u2014 currently set to rise with inflation from $11.40 an hour to $11.60 in October, up to $14 on Jan. 1, 2018, and $15 the following year.\nBut the according to a study commissioned by Ontario\u2019s Chamber of Commerce, the bill will put jobs at risk and have \u201cdramatic unintended consequences.\u201d Chamber vice- president Karl Baldauf said the province needs to slow down and amend its legislation.\n\u201cShould the government move forward with these vast, unprecedented reforms, there will be significant, sudden and sizable uncertainty for jobs and economic growth in Ontario,\u201d he said. The report also says that Ontario businesses will see a $23 billion \u201chit\u201d over the next two years because of the legislation. While the changes won\u2019t cause mass layoffs, they will kill job growth, said Paul Smetanin, president of the Canadian Centre for Economic Analysis, which conducted the study.\n\u201cThe results are not sensationalized,\u201d Smetanin said. \u201cWe have been conservative in adopting what literature suggests. It pains us to have to deliver such a message.\u201d\nThe report also estimates there will be costs for the Ontario government itself. Increased costs associated with the bill will add $440 million in debt to the province\u2019s treasury.\n\u201cAs I go from community to community, the thing that I\u2019m hearing over and over again is that these changes are all too much too fast,\u201d he said.\nLabour Minister Kevin Flynn said the government will review the findings the report. It\u2019s one of a \u201clong list\u201d of studies on the topic, he added.\n\u201cWe recognize there are concerns from the business community,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked hard to make sure Ontario\u2019s business climate is competitive, and we are committed to working with the business community to bring forward initiatives that will improve our competitiveness even more.\nThat being said, we will not back down from our plan to bring fairness to Ontarians.\u201d\nProgressive Conservative labour critic John Yakabuski said the Liberal government needs to conduct its own economic impact study of the new bill.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be a tragedy if all of these 185,000 people are put out of work,\u201d Yakabuski said in a statement. \u201cA higher minimum wage doesn\u2019t help if Ontarians don\u2019t have a job to wake up to in the morning.\u201d\nsjeffords@postmedia.com\nSmall businesses will be hit hard: CFIB\nANTONELLA ARTUSO\nAn economic analysis of proposed labour law changes including a $15-an-hour minimum wage confirms that small businesses are going to get hit hard, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) says.\nJulie Kwiecinski, the CFIB\u2019s director of provincial affairs in Ontario, said its own member survey shows that one-third are considering shutting down or moving in response to the mandatory wage hikes beginning with a $14-an-hour minimum on Jan. 1.\n\u201cUnfortunately, we have felt and seen the government do their eye rolls at us... not believing what we were saying in our survey,\u201d Kwiecinski said Monday. \u201cThey\u2019re scared, they\u2019re worried that this is actually going to start taking effect on Jan. 1.\u201d\nA report prepared by the Canadian Centre for Economic Analysis (CANCEA), on behalf of the Ontario Chamber of Commerce and the Keep Ontario Working Coalition, says small businesses are five times more likely to be impacted by the new provincial labour legislation than large companies.\nThe government bill goes before a committee next week when MPPs will have the chance to introduce amendments, she said.\n\u201cIf people think it\u2019s bad now, it could get worse in terms of the cost to business and jobs when the whole process is said and done,\u201d Kwiecinski said.\nThe Ontario Federation of Labour (OFL) issued a statement Monday dismissing the findings of the CANCEA analysis as \u201cinaccurate, incomplete and just not responsible.\u201d\nThe \u201ccorporate lobby\u201d analysis fails to consider economic benefits to raising the minimum wage such as higher consumer spending and reduced demand on social services, the OFL statement says.\nPeer-reviewed economic research has found that contrary to the report\u2019s claim that 185,000 jobs are at risk, increases in minimum wage have \u201cvery small, if any impacts\u201d on employment levels, the statement says.\nCANCEA said in its report that it is independent and does not accept any research funding that requires a pre-determined result or policy stance."}

It has grown to about 230,000 acres \u2013 or 360 square miles. The fire is spreading so rapidly that containment on Sunday was downgraded from 15 percent to just 10 percent.\nMore than 4,000 firefighters were engaged in the effort to contain the flames. Although the Thomas Fire is still raging, most of the smaller fires are being gradually brought under control, officials said.\nJonathan Bastian of member station KCRW says that strong and unpredictable winds have kept fire crews scrambling to stay ahead of the Thomas Fire. Crews were using water-dropping planes and helicopters to battle the fires.\n\"The air quality remains so bad that schools and colleges have canceled classes,\" Jonathan reports. \"In downtown Santa Barbara, a layer of white ash has descended over a city famous for its pristine beaches.\"\nChris Harvey of Cal Fire, says he is hopeful that the high winds could die down soon, giving firefighters the upper hand.\n\"They're expected to die down a little bit moving into Tuesday and Wednesday,\" he says. \"So, we're hoping for a break from the wind.\"\nSunday brought mandatory evacuations for the Central Coast areas of Carpinteria, Summerland, Montecito and Santa Barbara \u2013 some of which have not been affected by wildfires in decades.\nThe biggest concern is for Carpinteria, where the fire was moving west above the city in an area of very dry vegetation that hasn't burned in about 100 years, Steve Swindle, a spokesman for the Ventura County Fire Department was quoted by The Los Angeles Times as saying.\nThe Associated Press reports that officials \"handed out masks to residents who stayed behind in Montecito, the wealthy hillside enclave that's home to celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey, Jeff Bridges and Rob Lowe.\"\n\"This is a menacing fire, certainly, but we have a lot of people working very diligently to bring it under control,\" Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown told an evening news conference, according to Reuters.\nAbout 5,000 residents were under evacuation orders in the area and 15,000 homes were threatened.\nKPCC reports that University of California, Santa Barbara, announced Sunday afternoon that it would postpone final exams due to the fires.\nIn an email to students from Chancellor Henry T. Yang, he said the campus would remain open, but he encouraged all students who want to leave to do so.\nGov. Jerry Brown warned on Saturday that the long-running drought in California that has quite literally added fuel to the fire, had extended fire season.\n\"This is the new normal,\" Brown said as he surveyed damage from the Thomas Fire. \"We're about ready to have firefighting at Christmas. This is very odd and unusual.\""}

Yellow in color, mercury emerges as a bright star\nNotice, it appears in the morning from Jan. 5 to Feb. 14, in the evenings starting March 23 to April 8, then again in the mornings from April 29 to June 7, and in the evenings from July 5 to Aug. 17, then also in the mornings from Sept. 6 to Sept. 20, and till evenings from Nov. 2 to Dec. 4 and then mornings from Dec. 20 to Dec. 31.In the evening between from March 23 and April 8, and in the morning sky from Sept. 6 to 20, mercury would be very bright and visible.\nVenus\nVenus appears in the west as silvery light from Jan. 1 to March 16, and in the east dawn from April 3 through Nov. 13. It will start from mid-February, lasting until early May. It looks like a slender crescent through telescopes. In its bright form, Venus appears at night from Jan. 30 through March 1, reaching the highest brightness on Feb. 17. Brightest Venus in the morning appears from April 15 through May 14, reaching its highest brightness on April 30.\nIt will become faint in the north in the morning of Sept. 20; but, it will appear low in the east-northeast dawn, separated by only half a degree, according to iTechPost.\nMorning of Oct. 5, Venus will pass one-quarter of a degree north of Planet Mars, and the Mars will be seen only 1\/191 as bright. Before Venus disappears in the morning dusk on Nov. 13, it will pass 0.3 degrees north of Planet Jupiter. You will observe the two planets creating a prominent sight, located low side by side in the east-southeast when its dawn.\nMars\nMars has a yellow orange tint that may vary depending on its brightness. It starts in the evenings from Jan. 1 through June 6 and mornings from Sept. 11 through Dec. 31.\nYou can say it\u2019s an off year for Mars, because the planet never becomes very bright or visible. Mars would be far from sun on Oct. 7, once it is 249.3 million kilometers from the sun. Mars is also very far like 378 million km from the Earth.\nBut, Mars would appear bright in July, 2018. Mars would be closer to Earth, as Mars' was historically on record approaches Earth in Aug. 2003.Mars will be close to Venus on Oct. 5.Mars and Mercury will be seen together on the morning of Sept. 16, when the two planets would appear with less than one-third of a degree of each other in the eastern sky.\nJupiter\nJupiter appears as a silver light in the mornings from Jan. 1 to April 6, and in the evenings from April 7 through Oct. 6, and in the mornings once again from Nov. 13 through Dec. 31.\nIn 2017, Jupiter will be highly bright against the fairly dim star background of Virgo, and then it will cross into Libra, the scales, on Nov. 15. Jupiter passes to the north of bluish Spica, and the brightest star of Virgo, on Sept. 12.\nJupiter will be very bright in 2017 appearing on March 28 to April 19. The star is in opposition to the Sun on April 7. It becomes close to Venus in the morning 13.\nSaturn\nSaturn has normal brightness with yellowish tone. The telescope with 30 powers can view Saturn. Saturn\u2019s famous rings were off edge-on toward Earth through 2009, and sometime were very problematic to observe. Now the rings have great view at their maximum slope toward Earth - Saturn centric latitude of 26.98 degrees - on Oct. 17.\nIn 2017 Saturn will cross through into Sagittarius, the archer, on Feb. 23. Then again back into Ophiuchus on May 18, where Saturn will continue until it crosses back into Sagittarius on Nov. 18. Observe Saturn in mornings from Jan. 1 to June 14 and evenings from June 15 to Dec. 4.\nSaturn will be in its brightest form in 2017 on June 12 to June 17. Saturn is at opposing side of the sun on June 15.\nUranus\nUranus is the only planet that can be seen in a naked-eye by people with good eyesight when the sky is clear. Uranus shines at greatness +5.7 and can be easily recognized with good telescopes. It looks green in telescope, and see it in evenings from Jan. 1 to March 29, also mornings of April 30 to Oct. 18 and evenings again from Oct. 19 to Dec. 31.\nThe brightest Uranus in 2017 appears on Aug. 27 to Dec. 7, and will reach at opposing side to the sun on Oct. 19. Mars will pass less than 0.6 degrees from Uranus on the evening of Feb. 26.\nNeptune\nNeptune will be in constellation of Aquarius in 2017. At a top scale of +7.8, Neptune will appear as blue, and would be only observed through astrophysics binoculars or a telescope. The star will appear on evenings of Jan. 1 through Feb. 15, till mornings of March 18 through Sept. 4 and evenings once again from Sept. 5 to Dec. 31.\nThe brightest Neptune in 2017 appears on July 13 to Oct. 28. On opposing side on Sept. 5. On the twilight of Jan. 12, you can use Venus to take you to Neptune, when Venus is located less than 0.4 degrees to the upper right of Neptune. Only a good telescope can show you solar system\u2019s most distant planet, and it will be 80,000 times fainter than Venus."}

San Clemente (16-9, 3-4) was eliminated from the league title race to snap their three-year streak.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the worst start I\u2019ve ever been a part of,\u201d San Clemente coach Marc Popovich said. \u201cThey outworked us in every area. They just kicked our butt all over the court.\u201d\nSan Clemente is currently in third place and the final playoff qualification spot \u2013 one game behind second-place Trabuco Hills, a half-game ahead of Tesoro and one game ahead of El Toro.\nThe Tritons have two games remaining \u2013 a Coast View crossover game at Mission Viejo on Feb. 6 and its final league game at El Toro on Feb. 8. Trabuco Hills closes out at home against Aliso Niguel and in a crossover against Capistrano Valley.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still right there,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cIf we get a win next week (against El Toro), we\u2019re going to finish no worse than third. We\u2019re going to be right there for the playoffs. Hopefully our guys can get it together and rally. Week or two left here, we\u2019ve got to find a way.\u201d\nAliso Niguel came out on fire, and San Clemente was as cold as ice.\nJayden Okubo hit two of his game-high four 3-pointers in the opening 21-0 run. Lucas Parks also hit one of the Wolverines eight 3-pointers, and Harminder Dhaliwal scored eight of his game-high 22 points in the first quarter.\nAnthony Smetona made the Tritons first basket of the game with just over a minute left in the first quarter. Smetona led San Clemente with six points.\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t ready to go for whatever reason tonight,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why it was. It\u2019s on us as coaches and our guys. We\u2019ve got to make sure we\u2019re better next week.\u201d\nDhaliwal and the Wolverines were also dominant inside and on the boards. Earlier in the week, Popovich pointed out that San Clemente had lost the rebounding battle in each of its league losses, and the trend continued on Friday.\nJacob Nemeth played his first game coming off an ankle injury last week, but only scored two points from the same pair of free throws in the second quarter.\nLuke Powell scored five points for San Clemente. Chris Kane and Max Marshall each scored four.\nA running clock was instituted in the fourth quarter, and Aliso Niguel hit three-pointers on each of its last three baskets of the game.\nThe final margin of victory, 43 points, was more than the combined margins of victory of San Clemente\u2019s eight losses this season, 38 points.\nFor in-game updates, news and more for all San Clemente High School sports programs, follow us on Twitter @SouthOCSports."}

They found that a specific compound known as a cytokine was elevated in people who died with CTE, but not in healthy people, healthy older people or patients with Alzheimer\u2019s, another degenerative brain disease.\n\u201cIt was a striking abnormality,\u201d said Dr. Ann McKee, director of Boston University\u2019s CTE Center and Chief of Neuropathology at the VA Boston Healthcare System.\n\u201cIt gives us clues as to how this disease develops. We are hoping that it also gives us hints as to how to treat it.\u201d\nPlay Facebook\nTwitter\nEmbed Brain Disease in 110 Out of 111 NFL Players' Brains, Study Finds 1:40 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\nCTE has most recently been in the headlines because McKee\u2019s team found that former NFL Patriot star Aaron Hernandez had serious CTE when he died by suicide at age 27 last April.\nThe elevated cytokine that they found is called CCL11. Like other cytokines, it can do both good and bad in the body. These inflammatory compounds are released to help heal damage or fight off infections. But if there are too many, they can cause damage.\nIt\u2019s not clear what is happening to raise CCL11 levels in the people with CTE. It may be a response to the injury. But McKee said it could be that there\u2019s an over-reaction that worsens the damage.\n\u201cWe know that the pathology advances even after a person stops being hit in the head,\u201d McKee told NBC News.\n\u201cEven though the person retired from the sport, is no longer being exposed to the head impact, we know the pathology and the clinical injury progresses. There seems to be a cascade, a vicious cycle \u2026that once it\u2019s started we can\u2019t stop,\u201d McKee added.\nRelated: Reports Finds Evidence of CTE in Most Former NFL Players\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that this protein is part of that progressive cascade and that by interrupting this, we could tone down or slow down the progression or maybe even stop the progression. But that\u2019s all fanciful.\u201d It would take years of research to show this.\nFor now, what the team found was that the bodies of people diagnosed with CTE had higher levels of CCL11.\n\u201cIt gives us clues as to how this disease develops. We are hoping that it also gives us hints as to how to treat it.\u201d\nThey studied the brains and spinal fluid of 23 former college and professional football players diagnosed with CTE. They compared them to the brains and spinal fluid of 50 non-athletes who had Alzheimer's disease and 18 healthy people who had not played contact sports.\nLevels were notably higher in the football players with CTE, and the longer they\u2019d played football, the higher the levels of CCL11 in their brains and spinal fluid, the team reported in the Public Library of Science journal PLoS ONE.\nNot only could the research perhaps one day lead to treatment, but it could help people now, said McKee.\n\u201cYou certainly would want to limit their future head impact exposure,\u201d she said.\n\"Not only did this research show the potential for CTE diagnosis during life, but it also offers a possible mechanism for distinguishing between CTE and other diseases,\u201d added Jonathan Cherry, a researcher who worked on the study.\nRelated: Head Injuries Clearly Linked to Brain Damage\nCTE is linked with behavioral issues.\n\u201cIf you look at our research, collectively certainly, we see symptoms of depression and hopelessness and we see impulsivity and poor judgment, violence and suicidality,\u201d said McKee.\nBut, she noted, it\u2019s not possible to ascribe any individual\u2019s behavior to CTE. There haven\u2019t been enough cases studied to do that.\nMcKee, who has been studying this brain damage for years, said she is glad to have something positive to offer patients.\n\u201cFor the first time for me I am not reporting depressing news,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI\u2019m just not sitting here cataloging people that have died and what their brains look like. We are trying to learn as much as possible from them so that we can apply it to living people.\u201d"}

These two movies, both following the same characters, have a great concept and whilst bringing forward some very interesting ideas, are not always the best-executed films.\nGhost in the Shell (1995)\nMamoru Oshii\u2019s original 1995 anime is set in the year 2029, a time where technology and humanity have begun to merge leading to the human soul becoming known as a \u201cghost\u201d that can be transferred into different cybernetic bodies. The Major, Motoko Kusanagi (Atsuko Tanaka) is a cyborg who is part of a police force called Section 9. The force begins to investigate a fugitive known as \u201cThe Puppet Master\u201d (Iemasa Kayumi) who is taking control of people\u2019s bodies for unknown reasons. As the Major and her partner Batou (Akio \u00d4tsuka) close in on The Puppet Master, they begin to uncover troubling secrets that lead them to question their own humanity.\nFor a start, Ghost in the Shell has a fantastic concept. Oshii\u2019s vision of a near future where technology and humanity have become one is not as far-fetched now as it was just over 20 years ago. The somewhat bleak looking world is wonderfully realised through beautiful animation, which gives the film a very Blade Runner-esque feel.\nThe film also has a great score from Kenji Kawai. It sets the tone throughout, with some long stretches of the film being accompanied by nothing but the haunting opening score in the background. These stretches are needed however as the film requires a lot of thinking. This, however, is one of Ghost in the Shell\u2019s biggest problems. The ideas and themes explored in the film, particularly those based on what it means to be human, are conveyed in a way that is very difficult to follow. The film\u2019s run-time does not allow for a thorough explanation of the world\u2019s lore and instead throws a lot of information at you in a very short amount of time. Due to this, you\u2019d be forgiven for being confused by the film\u2019s ending and the events that led up to it.\nVerdict: A thought-provoking anime that struggles to fit in all its ideas, but is still thoroughly entertaining. 4\/5\nGhost in the Shell (1995), directed by Mamoru Oshii, is distributed in the UK by Shochiku, Certificate 15.\nGhost in the Shell (2017)\nThe live action Ghost in the Shell, which came out earlier this year, again focuses on the Major, but this time she has the name Mira Killian (Scarlett Johansson). Having her brain placed in the body of a cyborg after an accident, the Major is assigned to Section 9 to hunt the terrorist known as Kuze (Michael Pitt) who is hunting down members of Hanka Robotics\u2019 mysterious project 2571. As the Major and her team learn more about Kuze and his motives, she begins to question the nature of her identity.\nLike the anime before it, Ghost in the Shell is a visual spectacle with the world from the original film fully realised here by director Rupert Sanders. That being said, the world seems a lot less bleak than the 1995 version, but this appears to be the case because we see the Major explore more than in the first movie. For a film that is mostly CGI though, the visuals are very impressive.\nScarlett Johansson is excellent in the film and successfully captures Major\u2019s lack of emotion and expression in her performance. Also great is the returning character of Batou played very well here by Pilou Asb\u00e6k. Peter Ferdinando\u2019s Cutter is not the most interesting villain, but the actor performs his role well enough to make him less cartoonish than he is written at times.\nThe first half of the film is unfortunately quite a bore with not a lot going on in terms of story progression. Like the anime, the problem of world building and explaining things quickly hinders the audience\u2019s understanding at times. However, the different yet more simple plot of the live action adaptation does make the story easier to follow and it has to be said that the quality significantly ramps up after Major\u2019s first confrontation with Kuze.\nThe film is also a great homage to the anime. Some scenes are recreated almost shot for shot, very faithfully and in a way that works for the film; nothing feels forced in. The same can be said for a few story elements that appear as well. Certain plot points and character actions are straight out of the 1995 version but are written in such a way that they make sense to the new story.\nVerdict: Despite being very slow for the first half, the film is a faithful adaptation of the original and changes enough to keep it interesting by the end. 3\/5\nGhost in the Shell (2017), directed by Rupert Sanders, is distributed in the UK by Paramount Pictures, Certificate 12a\nOverall, watching the two Ghost in the Shell films (not including the anime\u2019s sequels), back to back is a good way to really appreciate them. Their complex ideas of what it really means to be human, as well as their relevance to today with regards to technology\u2019s role in society, makes them both very interesting films."}

The government now plans to connect existing homes to city utilities and provide alternative heating methods, Gunbileg said.\n\"There will be a technical expo held to demonstrate to the masses what kind of technology is available and options for heating to choose from instead of coal,\" she said.\nHomes with wood burning stoves will be allowed to burn \"enhanced coal\" that emits less smoke and ash, and the state plans to subsidize electric heating units. Ten factories currently produce these enhanced coal briquettes for homes in Ulaanbaatar, but production lags demand.\nCoal, one of Mongolia's major export commodities, is a primary cause of the pollution, producing huge amounts of particulate matter as well as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, hazardous components of smog and acid rain.\nChina's capital Beijing is also slashing coal use, while surrounding Hebei province plans to ban direct coal combustion in nine counties in 2017, with residents set to switch to electricity, natural gas or biomass.\n(Reporting by Terrence Edwards; Editing by David Stanway and Richard Pullin)"}
{"id":"d4c90e7b-4f5c-4280-8ddd-41e74214da68","text":"President Trump's announcement Wednesday that the United States would recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital was both correct and prudent from America's perspective. Much more remains to be done to relocate the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but this was a vital first step.\nWhat is now critical is implementing Trump's decision. Will the State Department actually carry out the new U.S. policy \u2014 which State's bureaucracy strongly opposed \u2014 or will the entrenched opponents of moving the embassy subvert it quietly by inaction and obfuscation?\nIn 1948, the United States, under Harry Truman, was the first country to recognize the modern state of Israel upon its declaration of independence. Nonetheless, Truman, at the State Department's urging, declined to acknowledge Jerusalem as Israel's capital, a mistake continued by his successors. Trump has now corrected this error: Jerusalem has been Israel's capital since 1948, and the sooner the American flag flies over the American embassy there, the better.\nThe expected protests and violence from the usual suspects in the Middle East have already begun, and more can be expected. Fear of these protests has deterred prior administrations from moving the embassy to Jerusalem. But it is wrong for America to bend to such efforts to intimidate us. Congressional support will be overwhelming, as it should be; over 20 years ago, the House and the Senate legislated almost unanimously that the president should relocate our embassy to Jerusalem. Given the inevitable bureaucratic obstructionism, however, Congress must continue playing an important role \u2014 by constantly prodding the State Department and by providing prompt and adequate funding for building a first-class new embassy.\nAt a stroke, Trump has also extinguished numerous fantasies still thriving at the United Nations and in many national capitals around the world. The first is that several General Assembly resolutions from the U.N.'s early days in the late 1940s still have any force or effect. Trump's announcement, for example, means that Resolution 181 (creating an Arab and a Jewish state out of Britain's Palestinian mandate and establishing Jerusalem as a corpus separatum \u2014 an independent city under U.N. Trusteeship Council authority) is a dead letter. Moreover, the so-called \u201cright of return\u201d for Palestinian refugees arising from Israel's 1947-49 war of independence, long out of date and flatly rejected by Israel, is now also on history's trash heap.\nTrump's embassy decision helps bring into focus the real issues that now need to be addressed. The Middle East peace process has long needed clarity and an injection of reality, and Trump has provided it. Palestinian leaders have for decades said that moving the embassy would bring negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians to a grinding halt. That is true only if the Palestinians wish it, and would demonstrate that their commitment to true peace that recognizes the permanence of Israel was a snowflake, insincere from the start.\nNo lasting peace can be based on illusions, and Trump's approach has made that objective more rather than less likely.\nJohn Bolton, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, was the U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations and, previously, the undersecretary of State for arms control and international security."}
{"id":"11eb5d16-bde7-4e59-8fa3-e28cafbf7ee8","text":"Washington (CNN) The Senate Intelligence Committee remains deeply divided over whether there is evidence of collusion between Donald Trump's campaign and Russia after a year-long investigation, the latest sign that Congress is unlikely to find consensus over a key question surrounding the 2016 elections.\nThe committee has tried for the past year to showcase bipartisanship in its investigation, taking pride that it has yet to devolve into public partisan mudslinging like its counterpart in the House. But by taking the high ground, the committee has so far punted on making any determination about collusion.\nNow, senators now find themselves facing the same partisan pitfalls as the House and the rest of Washington over whether there was any collusion and when it should release a report that would have broad ramifications for Trump and the November midterms.\nRepublicans on the panel maintain they've seen no evidence of collusion, while Democrats say it's clear that the Russians had found willing partners in the Trump campaign to sway the 2016 race.\n\"There was clearly an intent to collude,\" said Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden.\nAsked if he believes there's evidence to support the notion of collusion, GOP Sen. Roy Blunt said: \"Not that I've seen.\"\nRepublican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine agreed.\n\"Our investigation is not complete, but to this date and time I have not,\" Collins said when asked if she'd seen evidence of collusion.\nIntelligence Chairman Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, said that the committee has \"a handful\" of witnesses remaining to interview. He was hopeful the interviews could be completed by June and the report itself could be done by Labor Day -- but it's unclear if the panel will be able to release an unclassified report before the midterms.\nAdded to the complications: midterm politics and special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. Some on the panel, like Collins, resist the idea of issuing a report on collusion in the run-up to the midterm elections when control of Congress will be at stake, while others are skeptical about concluding their probe while Mueller appears to be charging ahead.\nJUST WATCHED Rudy Giuliani: Mueller probe now illegitimate Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Rudy Giuliani: Mueller probe now illegitimate 01:28\n\"No, no,\" said California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, said when asked if the panel's report on collusion would be as definitive as Mueller's probe. \"Look what he's done with the indictment,\" she said, referring to the 13 Russians charged by the special counsel for allegedly seeking to meddle in the 2016 race. \"So I think they have a level of professionalism and a level of law behind them that we don't.\"\nSen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat facing a tough re-election battle in West Virginia, said the ultimate question about whether Trump associates colluded with the Russians will be decided by Mueller. \"I really think that's where Mueller will prove that case. ... I think he's done deeper dives than we did,\" Manchin said, citing \"tools\" that the committee doesn't have.\nHow the committee ultimately deals with the matter will be a major test for the two leaders of the panel, Burr and Vice Chairman Mark Warner, a Democrat. Burr, in particular, has managed to distance himself from the controversy engulfing House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes, who has taken a series of steps that have given the White House ammunition to fight back against the investigations, from his \"memo\" alleging surveillance abuses to a GOP committee that stated the panel found no evidence of collusion.\nBurr cannot hold out forever -- he at some point will have to wade into the issue of collusion that could either help Trump's case -- or put him in the crosshairs of the President of his own party.\nIn recent interviews, Burr has expressed skepticism that there was collusion, but he has been careful not to make a judgment yet.\n\"I'm going to wait until we have all the facts before I make a determination,\" Burr said.\nYet Burr has resisted Democratic demands to bring Trump associates back for a second round of interviews to sit down for questioning by senators after their initial meetings with Senate staff. Senators have not participated in the vast majority of interviews with witnesses so far, leaving it to the staff of the panel, which Burr has argued is how the committee has traditionally conducted major investigations.\nIndeed, Burr has backtracked on a pledge he gave to bring back Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen, who met privately with committee staff last year.\n\"Not that I know of right now,\" Burr said when asked last month if he had more questions for Cohen.\nMoreover, Burr has been uneager to dig into other areas at the request of Democrats like Wyden, who say the panel needs to fully investigate Trump's finances to learn about the extent of the Russia connections.\n\"I am not at all satisfied on where the committee is on the follow-the-money issue, and if anything, the case for following the money is stronger today than it was 60 days ago,\" Wyden said last week, citing reports about Cohen receiving payments for a firm with ties to a Russian oligarch.\nWarner, however, has suggested that the issue about potential money laundering was better suited for Mueller to investigate -- not the Senate panel. And Warner has been cautious about asserting that the panel has evidence to make a definitive statement on collusion.\n\"We're going through this on a methodical basis and will follow the facts,\" said Warner, who would not predict the probe would conclude before November.\nOthers are more forceful in their beliefs on collusion.\nSen. Jim Risch, an Idaho Republican, made clear he sees no evidence of collusion and doesn't expect any will emerge, seizing on comments last year from Feinstein that she hadn't seen any evidence that the campaign received \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton from the Russians.\n\"I've been ready a long time now. I'm so ready you can't believe it,\" Risch said of the end of the investigation. \"I've looked at thousands and thousands of pages and reviewed the transcripts. I'm not at liberty to disclose what my conclusion is, but Dianne Feinstein said some time ago she saw no evidence of collusion, and Dianne is a really good friend of mind - and sometimes she gets things exactly right.\"\nFeinstein pushed back.\n\"Define collusion,\" Feinstein said when asked if she believed there was evidence showing collusion. \"Were there meetings to discuss things? We know there were. Is that collusion? So, I think the definitive (investigation) is the Mueller probe.\"\nA committee source said senators may not agree about whether Trump is tied to any potential collusion. But the source said that a majority of senators on the panel are on the same page when it comes to the facts surrounding problematic contacts that members of Trump's team had with Russians during the campaign.\nJUST WATCHED Senate panel breaks with House on Russia meddling Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Senate panel breaks with House on Russia meddling 03:21\nInterim reports\nAs the committee's investigation crossed the one-year mark, Burr and Warner began releasing portions of their investigation that had been completed in March -- on issues separate from collusion where the panel could achieve bipartisan consensus.\nThe senators have put out an unclassified report and recommendations tied to election security and finished their examination of the US Intelligence Community's January 2017 assessment, agreeing with the conclusion that Russian President Vladimir Putin was trying to help Trump in 2016 -- a finding that was at odds with Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee.\nBurr and Warner are planning two more interim reports, one on the Obama administration's response to the Russian meddling, and another on the use of social media in the election.\nThen once those are done, the committee will be left to try to tackle the collusion question.\nThe committee has interviewed more than 100 witnesses and reviewed hundreds of thousands of pages of documents related to the probe that's been underway since January 2017.\nAnd while the committee's senators largely said they should operate separately from Mueller, the special counsel investigation has already proven the ability to uncover information that Congress does not have, which could potentially change the trajectory of the Senate probe should they wait for more of Mueller's findings.\nOver the course of the various Russia investigations, numerous contacts between Trump's team and Russians have been uncovered, including the 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian operatives, as well as Trump foreign policy campaign adviser George Papadopoulos' 2016 meeting with a London professor who also was offering damaging information on Clinton that came from the Russians.\n\"I think what's clear is there was a set of relationships and a friendliness inside this campaign with high-level Russian operatives that we've really never an analog for in our country's history,\" said Sen. Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat. \"I'm not going to speak prematurely to the outcome of the investigation but I think that alone should be shocking to the American people.\"\nJUST WATCHED Warner: Possible 'pattern' on Don Jr meetings Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Warner: Possible 'pattern' on Don Jr meetings 03:52\nFinished by Labor Day?\nBurr has suggested the report can be done by Labor Day.\n\"This gives us the month of August in all likelihood to wrap up our investigation. And for staff to work intensely while we're out of here not getting in their hair,\" Burr said. \"We could be in a situation where members could look at that and digest it over the beginning of September.\"\nBurr, however, has previously predicted the investigation could have concluded by the end of 2017 and early into 2018, deadlines that have come and gone while the committee continues to quietly interview witnesses. And it's not clear, even if the committee completed its investigation by September, whether it would be able to release an unclassified report before the midterms.\nBut the schedule could create a dilemma for Burr.\nSome, liked Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris, argue that the election should have no bearing on when the committee puts out its final document.\n\"I think that it should run its natural course,\" Harris said. \"Certainly it shouldn't be motivated by any election or politics at all.\"\nYet others are skeptical about taking such a step in the heat of the midterms, saying the conclusion will be viewed skeptically by the public.\nManchin argued that anything issued right before the elections risks being viewed as \"politically motivated\" that is \"not going to help us come to the conclusion we have confidence and faith in.\"\nCollins praised Burr and Warner for their handling of the investigation so far, but she said she had concerns about the report coming out in the heat of the campaign season. \"I think that it should not be right before the midterms,\" she said."}

The teenager is already being compared to Pele as he emerges as the X-factor for the French but will need to be afforded every available opportunity if he is to make an impact in the match at the Nizhny Novgorod Stadium.\nThe best way to utilise the 19-year-old\u2019s incredible pace and finishing acumen, so vividly displayed with two goals in the 4-3 win over Argentina in the round of 16, has been the subject of much debate in the build-up to the World Cup but certainly a pleasurable problem for the coach.\n\u201cI cannot complain that I have players who can take up several offensive positions,\u201d Deschamps said earlier this year. \u201cBut I can make sure that they are used in their best position.\u201d\nWhile many pundits insist Mbappe is best used in a classic centre-forward role, Deschamps is likely to play him on the right of the attack on Friday, making place for Olivier Giroud to join Antoine Griezmann in what will be a trio of forwards.\nFrance will need all the attacking flair they can muster, because breaking down Uruguay will be like a jackhammer trying to tear open a tar road.

(AP) \u2014 Sitting inside the cool lobby of Rebellious Makeup By Morgan, owner Morgan Johns talked about why she uses canabidiol (CBD) oil as a natural pain solution for her osteoarthritis and hip issues.\nShe said her doctors offered her pain relievers and muscle spasm medication to relieve her pain, but she was not interested in a fistful of prescriptions.\n\"I did not want to go down that path with the opioid crisis as crazy as it is right now,\" Johns said. \"Anyone can get addicted to anything if given enough or they become dependent on it.\"\nA friend encouraged Johns to try the CBD oil, and while she was skeptical, Johns said she agreed. A two-fluid-ounce container cost her less than $50.\n\"I knew an instant reaction within about 45 minutes of energy,\" Johns said. \"I felt like I had a cup of coffee or a shot of espresso.\"\nBut she had no other side effects and the pain was still present.\n\"Then I would say about a month and a half in, that was when I really started to notice I felt better,\" Johns said. \"I've read people call it a placebo effect, but even if it is, I have tried other things and this works. If it is a placebo, why wouldn't I have a placebo effect with anything else?\"\nJohns decided to sell the oil in her salon and went to city officials and the chief of police to talk about selling it in the community. Johns said she was not saying CBD oil was a cure-all; she just wanted to offer it as an option.\nAt first she could not keep up with the sales, and then signs started popping up around Elwood where others were selling CBD oil.\n\"When the market flooded, I just started directing people to others selling this product,\" she said holding her bottle of oil.\nJohns said people need to be careful what they buy because not all CBD oils are the same. She recommends looking for a full list of ingredients, asking to talk to other customers who use it, and researching the company that makes it.\n\"If you don't know what it is or you can't research what they call it, there may be a reason why you don't know what is in it,\" Johns said. \"They don't want you to know what is in it.\"\nThe Herald Bulletin reached out to doctors and nutritionists throughout Madison County to talk about the risks or benefits of CBD oil, but no one in the medical field responded to the request for information.\nMedical advances with CBD products, however, are underway.\nEarlier this week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a drug containing purified CBD, to be used to treat rare forms of childhood epilepsy.\nThe FDA states the approval for the drug is an important medical advancement, but the agency stresses this is not an approval of marijuana or all of its components.\n\"This is the approval of one specific CBD medication for a specific use,\" according a press release by the FDA. \"It's being delivered to patients in a reliable dosage form and through a reproducible route of delivery to ensure that patients derive the anticipated benefits.\n\"This is how sound medical science is advanced.\"\nContrary to popular belief, the FDA insists it has been supportive of the research of marijuana for medical uses.\nThe agency has an active program to assist drug developers who want to investigate marijuana or its components through properly controlled clinical trials, to demonstrate the potential for safe and effective uses.\nMarijuana is classified as a Schedule I compound by the FDA with known risks so the treatment of medical disorders must be conducted under the same standard as other drug compounds, according to the agency.\nThe FDA notes that a growing interest in the development of therapies derived from marijuana and its components, such as CBD oil, has developed within the past decade.\nProponents of medical marijuana claim the plant is effective in treating a number of medical conditions, including cancer, multiple sclerosis, post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. But these claims do not sit well the FDA.\nThe agency said it is concerned by the \"proliferation and illegal marketing of unapproved CBD-containing products with unproven medical claims.\"\nActions have been taken by the FDA against companies distributing CBD oil drops, capsules, syrups, teas, topical lotions and creams that claim the products can be used to treat or cure serious diseases such as cancer with no scientific evidence to support such claims.\n\"We'll continue to take action when we see the illegal marketing of CBD-containing products with unproven medical claims,\" the FDA stated in a press release. \"We're especially concerned when these products are marketed for serious or life threatening diseases, where the illegal promotion of an unproven compound could discourage a patient from seeking other therapies that have proven benefits.\"\nThe Low Cost Prescription pharmacy in Elwood has a sign on its building that says they sell \"hemp CBD oil.\" No one inside the pharmacy knew much about the product and they directed customers to a handwritten sign hanging next to the pharmacy window that says the oil is used to treat diabetes, anxiety, cancer and more than a dozen other ailments. A seven-day supply of the oil sells for $30, or a 28-day supply sells for $100.\n\"We don't know anything about it,\" said a woman named Brittney behind the counter. \"All we have is a paper hanging over there about it. We just know what people tell us.\"\nA new law that took effect July 1 will change the way CBD oil can be sold in Indiana.\nAs of today, all low-THC hemp extracts must be packaged with a scannable bar code or QR code linked to a document disclosing the manufacturer of the finished product, a certificate of analysis verifying the hemp extract is the product of a batch tested by an independent lab and contains no more than 0.3 percent THC, along with the results of the testing sample.\nThe scannable code must also provide a batch date, expiration date and ingredients.\nJohns said the changes will help people make informed and safe decisions about the products they are consuming.\n\"Do the research,\" she said.\n___\nSource: The Herald Bulletin, https:\/\/bit.ly\/2KITSvA\n___\nInformation from: The Herald Bulletin, http:\/\/www.theheraldbulletin.com\nEds: This is an Indiana Exchange story shared by The Herald Bulletin"}
{"id":"342f212e-2ae4-4ab9-bc28-6e058cbd457d","text":"Though some predicted and feared an acting field lacking diversity, the nominees were fairly inclusive. Denzel Washington (\"Roman J. Israel, Esq.\"), Mary J. Blige (\"Mudbound\"), Hong Chau (\"Downsizing\") and Octavia Spencer (\"The Shape of Water\") were among the 30 film acting nominees.\nBut the best director category remained all-male, as it has for most of Globes and Academy Awards history. Many had thought this year might be different due to directors like Gerwig, Patty Jenkins (\"Wonder Woman\") and Dee Rees (\"Mudbound\"). But the nominees were: Spielberg, del Toro, Nolan, McDonagh and Scott.\nThe morning's biggest surprise, aside from the success of \"All the Money in the World,\" might have been the omission of the romantic comedy \"The Big Sick,\" penned by real-life couple Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon. Another Oscar underdog, \"The Florida Project,\" emerged with only one nomination, for Willem Dafoe's supporting performance as the manager of a low-rent motel.\nIn the television categories, the Emmy-winning \"Big Little Lies,\" which is directed by Montreal's Jean-Marc Vallee, earned a number of acting nods (Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon, Shailene Woodley, Alexander Skarsgard) as well as best limited series. (HBO recently announced a second season for \"Big Little Lies,\" which will change its category in other awards shows.)\nOther nominees with Canadian connections include Toronto-born \"Will and Grace\" star Eric McCormack for best actor in a musical or comedy series, the Canadian co-production \"The Breadwinner\" for best animated film and the Alberta-shot series \"Fargo\" for TV's best limited series or motion picture. \"The Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\" based on Canadian author Margaret Atwood's acclaimed novel, also received several nominations, including best television drama.\nFX's Bette Davis and Joan Crawford chronicle \"Feud: Bette and Joan\" landed four nominations, including nods for Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon. Amazon's just-debuted \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" scored two nods, including best comedy series. Also with multiple nominations were Netflix's \"Stranger Things,\" and NBC's \"This Is Us.\"\nGary Oldman, nominated for best actor for his Winston Churchill in \"Darkest Hour,\" said the scandals have cast an unusual pall over the season, where Weinstein was for decades a dominating force.\n\"How should we celebrate? Well, I don't think any of it's funny, so I guess that people will stay away from it in the ceremony,\" said Oldman by phone Monday. \"It's evolution, and it's good that we sort of start to check ourselves about what we do and what we say and how we do it and how we say it to people, so I think it's ultimately a good thing. But I can't see too much of this coming up in (the show), up there on the platform, as it were, on the podium. It's not something to joke about, I don't think.\"\nThe nominees were announced from Beverly Hills after still-burning fires ravaged Southern California for the past week. The Thomas Fire has destroyed some 790 structures and forced thousands to evacuate their homes, with the blazes even entering the nearby neighbourhood of Bel Air.\nThe Globes haven't traditionally predicted the Oscars, but they did last January. The Globes best-picture winners \u2014 \"Moonlight\" and \"La La Land\" \u2014 both ultimately ended up on the stage for the final award of the Oscars, with \"Moonlight\" emerging victorious only after the infamous envelope flub. The press association, which has worked in recent years to curtail its reputation for odd choices, is composed of approximately 90 freelance international journalists.\nThe last Globes broadcast, hosted by Jimmy Fallon, averaged 20 million viewers, an upswing of 8 per cent, according to Nielsen. This year, Fallon's NBC late-night partner, Seth Meyers, will host the January 7 ceremony.\nNo Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement recipient has yet been chosen. Last year's honoree, Streep, spoke forcefully against the then President-elect Donald Trump, shortly before his inauguration, leading him to criticize the actress as \"overrated.\" This year, she \u2014 along with Spielberg and Hanks \u2014 return with a pointed and timely drama, \"The Post,\" about the power of the press to counter lies emanating from the White House.\nSaid Streep in a statement: \"I'm thrilled for the movie, for Steven and Tom, and for the incredible ensemble of actors who made this movie need its moment in history.\"\n___\nAssociated Press writers Lindsey Bahr and Sandy Cohen, and The Canadian Press contributed to this report\nBy Jake Coyle, The Associated Press"}

It's how we got here on Earth, how we arrived \"here from there,\" how the story unfolds. In Dickensian terms, one might say, \"I am born.\" But there is so much more to the story, and that's where the story gets interesting. That's the rationale behind Origins, the artisan wood-fired pizza and wine bar in downtown Loveland.\nAt least, that's proprietor Jeff Noffsinger's take on it.\nNoffsinger grew up in Indiana, but wood from his grandfather's barn in Dayton, Ohio is incorporated into the restaurant's bar. There is also a repurposed drug store cabinet from his Grandpa's home town pharmacy he's given new life. Noffsinger's globe trotting brought in the rest: the 900-degree wood burning oven arrived in one piece from Napoli, the birthplace of pizza. Recently voted the best wine bar in Colorado by Wild & CO., the name Origins echoes the Italian government's label DOC, or \"Denominazione di Origine Controllata,\" a guarantee that a wine is from a certain growing region. The rules govern not only the viticultural zone, but also grape varieties and wine style. The designation of a particular DOC preserves wine-making traditions.\nNoffsinger is all about community traditions and his trattoria reflects that. As with traditions, drinking wine together can create a culture of how people wish to live, ultimately making a community. Origins is a place designed for comfort, a pleasing environment to spend the evening with friends and family, mixing cultures and stories. The restaurant is divided into sections: the main dining room is hung with metallurgic sculptured light fixtures created by Loveland artist, Steve Shachtman Studios and near the entrance, Denny Haskew's bronze nude, single red rose held in her lap, sends an understated message of fertility and regeneration. Hugging the bow-fronted windows towards the back of the space is the wine hive, symbolizing a beehive's community efforts.\nBut as much as the surroundings are imbued with symbolism, the menu is straightforward, hearty Italian.\nRecommended Stories For You\nStart off with shared plates. The roasted garlic and red pepper hummus has earthy depth with peppery hints. Creamy but not whipped, it's served with a generous plateful of sliced veggies. The roasted beet salad balances sweetness pulled from the beets with tangy goat cheese tossed into mixed greens. Another good starter option is a deconstructed Caprese in burrata format, the plate strewn with heirloom tomatoes and basil pesto centered by a soft outer shell of fresh mozzarella wrapped around curd and cream. Scoop the delectable cheese onto toasted bread and top with pesto and tomatoes for an exquisite treat.\nWith pasta and pizza dough made in house from imported Italian flour, you'll want to include at least one from each type. Fermented for 38 hours before baking, the result is a chewy, airy pizza crust with a slightly sour taste; the pasta is springy and resilient with a firm texture.\nSince it was early spring, lamb seemed to be an appropriate theme for the evening, the perfect companion for the Renato Ratti 2012 Barolo. The Figura \u2014 fresh figs, tender shaved lamb, chopped pistachios, and feta atop a pistachio b\u00e9chamel made for a sweetly savory white-sauced pizza with pops of pepper from a liberal sprinkling of chili flakes. Tajarin lamb bolognese served with thick strands of egg noodle pasta was similar to a goulash in concept, thanks to a lighter sauce than a typical bolognese, which is cooked down for hours. Partnered with carrots, the result was fresh, flavorful, and a welcome springtime change from a dense bolognese. And make sure you order a bowlful of Tonarelli cacio e pepe, meaning \"cheese\" and \"pepper,\" a preparation not often found on Colorado menus. The popular Roman late night food contains only three ingredients: spaghetti, pecorino, and black pepper. Origins' version is a creamy bowl of comfort, the strands of pasta chewy and coated with melted cheese mixed with a little pasta cooking water to create a smooth, clingy sauce.\nA meal at Origins is a learning experience, bringing together the art of food and wine. Whether you're there for a travel-themed wine tasting or to explore a menu bursting with originality and flavor, ask questions and visit with the knowledgeable waitstaff. And then go home satisfied on so many levels.\nAward-winning author Emily Kemme writes about life, recipes and the search for humor.

His final call, it turned out, was the easiest of all.\nRather than risk yet another concussion, Scott has decided to retire at 58.\n\u201cI\u2019m done,\u201d he told The Associated Press.\nThe veteran crew chief missed nearly the entire 2017 season after a foul ball off the bat of Baltimore slugger Mark Trumbo in Toronto on April 14 caught him hard in the mask, causing Scott\u2019s second concussion in nine months and fourth in five years.\nWithin a few days, while undergoing treatment for head, neck and shoulder injuries, Scott realized it was the end of a major league career that began in 1985 and included three World Series assignments, three All-Star Games and 91 postseason games.\n\u201cIn fact, it was pretty easy,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on this year being the last one. But I thought, this is a sign.\u201d\nEspecially when he asked three doctors about the possible long-term effects if he got jarred again.\n\u201cThey said, \u2018We just don\u2019t know,'\u201d Scott said. \u201cBut they told me that the more times you get hit, the more probability that you\u2019ll have issues.\u201d\nThis summer, he saw Bruno Mars and Green Day in concert, watched Fourth of July fireworks from a boat near his home in Portland, Oregon, and enjoyed more time with husband Michael Rausch.\nThey\u2019ve been together since 1986 and were married in November 2013 in Palm Springs, California, by the city\u2019s mayor.\nScott came out as gay after the 2014 season. The next spring training, Reds outfielder Marlon Byrd gave Scott a big hug while trotting to the dugout.\n\u201cYou\u2019re free, brother. I\u2019m so proud of you,\u201d Byrd told him.\nSays Scott: \u201cI did feel free. I am who I am.\u201d\nScott\u2019s decision will resonate, said Billy Bean, Major League Baseball\u2019s vice president for social responsibility and inclusion. Bean came out as gay after his big league career ended in 1995.\n\u201cHe has achieved everything in his umpiring career, and has carried himself with integrity and garnered the respect of his peers and MLB players,\u201d Bean said. \u201cI am filled with pride as I reflect on all of his accomplishments. He\u2019s a pro\u2019s pro, who\u2019s been a wonderful example to the LGBT community and all sports fans.\u201d\n\u201cYears ago, Dale reached out to me after my personal story went public,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we had been able to have that conversation when I was still playing, I know it would have changed the course of my career. Dale\u2019s legacy will undoubtedly continue to inspire others to pursue their dreams, and I hope we see the results around MLB soon.\u201d\nScott worked 3,897 regular-season games and was a crew chief for 16 seasons, half his career.\n\u201cI was fortunate enough to have Dale as my crew chief for 10-plus years. A gifted umpire and true professional, he ran the crew with a smile as he mentored many of today\u2019s most successful umpires,\u201d fellow ump Dan Iassogna said.\n\u201cThe courage that he showed in coming out while still working on the field is as much of an accomplishment as his many World Series and postseason assignments,\u201d he added.\nScott acknowledged his decision to retire might have been more difficult if his circumstances were different \u2013 say, he was 40 and hadn\u2019t worked the World Series.\nNow, he walks away with his health intact. And if there were any doubts, he keeps the video of that last violent concussion on his cellphone.\nMLB provides long-term disability for umpires who cannot work because of concussion effects, the same as it does for other permanent injuries.\nScott wonders about umpires who are cleared as part of the concussion protocol and then face the choice of continuing to work and risk further injury, or leaving the game.\n\u201cThat needs to be addressed,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe my situation can be a catalyst for that.\u201d\nHis future will include rooting like crazy for the Oregon Ducks and, having been a Top 40 AM radio DJ in high school, perhaps some voice work.\nScott also can look back on all the games he did: Among them, he was the plate umpire for Scott Erickson\u2019s no-hitter, he worked a season-opening series in Australia, and was the last umpire to eject hot-tempered manager Billy Martin.\nAnd there was that game at old County Stadium in 1986, when a big crowd turned out to welcome the hugely popular Gorman Thomas back to the Milwaukee Brewers.\nThe first time Thomas batted, Scott called strike three. The fading slugger went 0 for 4 and when he got rung up in his last at-bat, it was more than Thomas could take.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my night,\u201d he pleaded with the rookie ump, \u201cnot yours!\u201d"}

As I get stronger and when I feel ready, I will tell my story in more depth, and plan to take this on strongly so I can not only raise awareness, but expand research for others who suffer as I do, so I can help make a difference. I use the word ''suffer'' not for pity, or attention, and have been disappointed to see people online suggest that I'm being dramatic, making this up, or playing the victim to get out of touring.\n''If you knew me, you would know this couldn't be further from the truth. I'm a fighter. I use the word suffer not only because trauma and chronic pain have changed my life, but because they are keeping me from living a normal life. They are also keeping me from what I love the most in the world: performing for my fans. I am looking forward to touring again soon, but I have to be with my doctors right now so I can be strong and perform for you all for the next 60 years or more. I love you so much. (sic)''"}

His last start for the Giants came April 28, and he pitched 7 2\/3 scoreless innings in two rehab starts for Triple-A Sacramento.\n\"Johnny's set to go,\" Bochy said. \"He passed all the tests, checked every box off. Been throwing the ball well. Hasn't given up a run there. Bullpen [session Monday] went fine. Been hitting, bunting. I talked to Johnny. He said, 'I'm ready to go. I feel better now than before [the injury].' When you get one of your big guys ready to go, you pitch him.\"\nBochy said Cueto would be limited to 85 pitches Thursday, and Derek Holland, if he doesn't come out of the bullpen in the Rockies series, would back up Cueto.\nSamardzija will pitch for the Giants for the first time since May 29. Bochy said that Dereck Rodriguez, who was scheduled to pitch Thursday, will instead start Friday. Madison Bumgarner, of course, will take his regular turn Sunday. That leaves Suarez or Chris Stratton for the final spot in the rotation. Both pitchers have minor league options.\nSuarez might have the advantage because he has pitched well lately. He went 2-0 in six June starts, and in his last outing Friday at Arizona, he allowed one run in six innings. Suarez made his Coors Field debut and first start against the Rockies on May 28 and allowed four runs (three earned) in five innings in a no-decision after heeding advice from catcher Buster Posey.\nSuarez said, \"I remember the last time we were, before my bullpen, Buster came up to me and he was like 'As long as you keep throwing it right, it'll be fine. But if you try too much, that's the problem you'll have. Your stuff isn't as good.' I just made sure to just throw it normal.\"\nMeanwhile, Stratton gave up a career-high 11 hits and a career-high eight runs in 5 2\/3 innings Tuesday. In his past six starts, Stratton is 1-3 with a 5.79 ERA.\nAnderson threw a career-high eight scoreless innings with one walk and eight strikeouts Wednesday at Los Angeles in a 3-1 win over the Dodgers. Anderson is 2-2 with a 2.70 ERA in his past five starts with six walks and 32 strikeouts in 33 1\/3 innings. He's 0-2 with a 5.56 ERA in four career starts against the Giants, including a no-decision May 20 at AT&T Park where he gave up five runs in 5 1\/3 innings as the Rockies lost 9-5.\nThe Rockies have won 14 of their past 16 games from the Giants (45-42) at Coors Field. The Rockies (43-43) have climbed back to .500 by winning five of their past six games. They have been getting outstanding starting pitching, the latest effort being seven scoreless innings Tuesday from Antonio Senzatela in his first start this season for the Rockies.\nThe Colorado starters have pitched well in six of the past eight games, going 4-0 with a 2.15 ERA in that stretch and allowing 12 earned runs and 31 hits in 50 1\/3 innings with 11 walks and 41 strikeouts.\n\"We're only going to go as far as they do,\" Rockies third baseman Nolan Arenado said. \"They're pitching great. They're giving the offense a chance. Quick innings, which is huge.\""}

More than 15 per cent of Facebook Inc's US employees in 2016 used a temporary work visa, according to a Reuters analysis of US Labour Department filings.\nBut a majority of the visas are awarded to outsourcing firms, sparking criticism by skeptics who say those firms use the visas to fill lower-level information technology jobs. Critics also say the lottery system benefits outsourcing firms that flood the system with mass applications.\nThe senior official said the end result of how the system currently works is that foreign workers are often brought in at less pay to replace American workers, \"violating the principle of the programme.\"\nSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, Democratic Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, Republican Representative Darrell Issa of California and Democratic Representative Zoe Lofgren of California were not immediately available to comment.\nFacebook, Microsoft Corp and Apple Inc were also not immediately available after normal business hours.\nThe order also asks federal agencies to look at how to get rid of loopholes in the government procurement process.\nSpecifically, the review will take into account whether waivers in free-trade agreements are leading to unfair trade by allowing foreign companies to undercut American companies in the global government procurement market. \"If it turns out America is a net loser because of those free-trade agreement waivers, which apply to almost 60 countries, these waivers may be promptly renegotiated or revoked,\" the second official said.\nREUTERS"}

Isocyanates is an important class of intermediates that belong to a family of compounds commonly known as heterocumulenes. The chemistry of these compounds is characterized by nucleophilic addition and cycloaddition reaction modes. Other common names of isopropyl isocyanate are propane, 2-isocyanato, 2-isocyanatopropane, and methyl ethyl isocyanate. Isopropyl isocyanate is a colorless liquid and it possesses strong pungent odor.\nRead Report Overview @ https:\/\/www.transparencymarketresearch.com\/isopropyl-isocyanate-market.html\nThe molecular formula of isopropyl isocyanate is (CH3)2CHNCO and its molecular weight is 85.11. A major route for the industrial production of isopropyl isocyanate is through the reaction of N-propan-2-ylcarbamoyl chloride with 2, 4, 6-trichlorophenol, which offers the product yield of around 88%. Isopropyl isocyanate is incompatible with several groups of chemical compounds and it reacts exothermally, releasing noxious gases.\nIsopropyl isocyanate is principally used as an intermediate for the manufacture of several industrial chemicals in industries such as fertilizers, pharmaceutical, and chemical. It is used as a reagent in the synthesis of O-aryl N-isopropyl carbamates. The compound is also used as a reagent in the manufacture of the androgen receptor antagonist used for treating prostate cancer. It is also used as a derivatization reagent in the stereo-isomeric analysis of secondary alcohols. Isopropyl isocyanate is employed to synthesize the selective dual inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin 1 and 2 (mTORC1 and mTORC2). Isopropyl isocyanate is toxic.\nRequest Report Brochure @ https:\/\/www.transparencymarketresearch.com\/sample\/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=24428\nIt can cause skin irritation and is fatal if inhaled. Reactions of this compound with alkali metals, aldehydes, mercaptans, phenols, alcohols, amines, ketones, peroxides, strong oxidizers, or hydrides result in the release of extreme heat. These reactions can occur with explosive violence. Increasingly stringent regulations regarding the use of toxic chemicals across the world are anticipated to restrain the growth of the isopropyl isocyanate market during the forecast period.\nAbout Us\nTransparency Market Research (TMR) is a global market intelligence company providing business information reports and services.

Instead, she said she wants people to continue her daughter\u2019s fight against injustice in a peaceful way.\n\u201cI miss her so, so much, but I\u2019m going to make her death worth something,\u201d Susan Bro told The Associated Press in an interview Monday.\nBro described her daughter, Heather Heyer, as a courageous, stubborn, and principled woman who was a firm believer in justice and equality who died Saturday for those beliefs. Bro said she would prefer to grieve in private, but felt compelled to try to follow her daughter\u2019s example.\n\u201cLet\u2019s take from her death that we\u2019re going to move forward in conversation. We\u2019re going to move forward in understanding and listening to one another and seeing how we can come together,\u201d Bro said.\nHeyer, 32, was among the hundreds of protesters who had gathered in Charlottesville to decry what was believed to be the largest gathering of white supremacists in a decade \u2014 including neo-Nazis, skinheads and Ku Klux Klan members \u2014 who descended on the city to rally against plans to remove a Confederate statue.\nFelicia Correa, a longtime friend of Heyer, said the slain woman was a \u201ctrue American hero.\u201d\nHeyer grew up in Greene County and worked as a legal assistant at a law firm. Her boss, Larry Miller, said the young woman was active in the firm\u2019s bankruptcy practice and had a \u201cbig heart.\u201d\n\u201cShe cares about the people we take care of. Just a great person,\u201d he said.\nTwo state troopers - Lt. H. Jay Cullen and Trooper-Pilot Berke M. M. Bates - also died when their helicopter crashed in a wooded area while deployed as part of a large-scale police effort to contain Saturday\u2019s violence. They were remembered for their commitment and love of their jobs.\nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe knew both troopers personally and expressed grief over their deaths. McAuliffe frequently uses state police aircraft to travel the state and said Cullen, 48, had been one of his regular pilots. Before joining the aviation unit, Bates has been a member of the state trooper team that guards the governor and his family.\n\u201cIt was personal to me,\u201d McAuliffe said Sunday morning at a church service. \u201cWe were very close.\u201d\nCullen was a 23-year veteran of the department and head of the aviation unit. He is survived by his wife and two sons. Berke joined the department in 2004, and is survived by his wife, a son and a daughter.\n\u201cBoth of them were great guys who loved what they were doing,\u201d said Perry Benshoof, a retired trooper who worked with both.\nCraig Bates said his younger brother had always wanted to serve others and to fly.\nThe younger Bates, who died one day short of his 41st birthday, worked for years as a trooper, first in Florida and then in Virginia. He\u2019d recently gotten his pilot\u2019s license so that he could apply to work for the department\u2019s aviation unit.

And the player felt a similar sentiment.\n\"As soon as he saw me, he ran over to me and jumped on my lap,\" recalls Defoe in an interview with CNN World Sport.\n\"I think probably from that moment, it was sort of overwhelming, because I was like 'oh wow.' And that sort of love he gave me from day one was just like, that instant moment, was sort of like when we bonded. It was just a great feeling.\"\nLowery is carried out by Defoe prior to Sunderland's match against Everton at Goodison Park in Feburary.\nHospital visit\nThe two of them have, at times, been inseparable with Defoe supporting Lowery as the youngster has battled cancer.\nIn February, Defoe and his Sunderland teammates visited Lowery in hospital, with the young boy falling asleep in the 34-year-old striker's arms.\n'I love you' - Watch the heartwarming moment we surprised @IAmJermainDefoe with this special message from his best pal @bradleysfight \ud83d\ude18 pic.twitter.com\/7WOZMLgzDb \u2014 Lorraine on ITV (@ITVLorraine) April 6, 2017\n\"He said to me 'do you want to get into the bed?'\" recalls the visibly moved Defoe.\n\"I was like, 'OK, no problem.' So, we sort of sat on the bed, and at this point he was really tired, because obviously it was a long day.\n\"We played with some toys and stuff like that and he told me about his girlfriend Poppy which was kind of funny.\n\"And then, literally, he just said to his mom: 'Can you turn the lights off?' And he sort of like put the blanket over me because he wanted me to be warm. He put the blanket over me, gave me a cuddle and he fell asleep.\n\"You know with some things it's difficult to find the exact words to describe how I felt at that time because I didn't really know what to do. I gave him a cuddle and I just felt good.\"\nDefoe has scoed 14 goals for Sunderland in the league this season.\n'Enjoy every moment'\nLast month the bond between Defoe and Lowery grew even stronger.\nLowery led out the England team at Wembley Stadium for a World Cup qualifier against Lithuania.\nThough goalkeeper Joe Hart was captain, he swapped places with Defoe in the tunnel so they could have the honor of leading the teams out, a gesture not lost on the striker.\n\"Joe Hart said to me 'you go in the front and walk Bradley out,'\" recalls Defoe.\n\"All the lads know the bond between me and Bradley and how important it is for him to be happy and enjoy every moment ... I mean, these moments will live with me for the rest of my life. I will never forget all the times he's walked out with me.\"\nDefoe and Lowery line up prior to England's World Cup qualifier against Lithuania.\nWhile Sunderland is looking likely to be relegated to England's second tier, Defoe has been in the form of his life, scoring 14 goals in the league and winning a recall to the international team.\nHe is at pains to emphasize how Lowery is on his mind whenever he takes to the pitch.\n\"To be honest, every time I play I always think about him, even in the England game,\" said Defoe, who scored in the 2-0 win over Lithuania.\n\"I just thought, you know what, I love scoring goals and I want to play well for my country and for my family, but every time I go out on the pitch it's always at the back of my mind. I want to do well, I want to score a goal for little Bradley.\"\nDefoe hugs Lowery ahead of Sunderland's game against Manchester United in April.\nSadly for Bradley, the road ahead does not look promising.\nHis mother recently revealed that the treatment Lowery has been receiving is not working, and that they \"don't know how long it will be before the cancer wins, but what we do know is that we will continue to make memories and enjoy our super hero every second of the day.\"\nAn upcoming trip to Disney World is in the works, and Defoe's diary continues to fill up.\n\"All I can do is try and spend as much time with him as possible and that's what I'm going to try and do from now until the end of the season, just try and see him when I can,\" explains Defoe.\n\"He's got a birthday party soon, which I'll be going to with my girlfriend, so we're looking forward to that. But just to be around him, just to try and make him happy with however long he's got.\""}

The ruling on costs was never appealed.\nOn April 20, 2016, the registrar confirmed the costs at $263,500 from the day the order was made by Justice Bain and a certificate of taxation verified the same and authorised an extension.\nHowever, Mr Smith subsequently sought an injunction against the effect of the order citing prejudice.\nHe filed an affidavit arguing that he should not be made to pay funds to a nominal plaintiff whose company had no known assets and would not be in a position to refund costs paid to them if the court later ruled he was not a proper party to the proceedings.\nHe also alleged he would suffer damage to his professional reputation.\nJustice Bain, in a ruling handed down November 9, 2016, stressed that Mr Smith had not appealed the order for costs and had, in fact, participated in the taxing of the costs, and \"is not able at this stage to object to the order for costs.\"\nThe court ruled that Mr Smith would pay the costs on\/or before December 12, 2016.\nA week after the November 9 decision, Mr Smith sought leave from Justice Bain to appeal the order to the Court of Appeal in a notice of motion filed November 16, 2016.\nIn January of this year, Justice Bain rejected his request which prompted Mr Smith to apply to the appellate court.\nIn March, appellate Justices Dame Anita Allen, Jon Isaacs and Stella Crane-Scott unanimously agreed to reject the application and indicated that written reasons would follow at a later date. In an 11-page judgment handed down last week, the judges explained their reasons for doing so.\n\"The applicant seeks leave to challenge ruling no 11 which only goes to, inter alia, extending the time for the applicant to pay costs,\" the court said.\n\"Thus, all other issues or matters raised in the grounds of appeal not arising out of that ruling may be discounted and ignored for the purposes of this application in as much as they are not relevant to the decision we have to make.\n\"Unfortunately, the applicant did not appeal ruling no 11 within the appropriate time. Further he participated, without objection, in the taxation of the costs. By doing so, he may be said to have accepted his liability to pay the respondent's costs. It was not now competent for him to raise in his grounds of appeal, issues which he did not argue before the learned judge and to seek to canvass matters which, in any event, are not of any consequence to the ruling appealed against.\n\"The test on a leave application is whether the proposed appeal has realistic prospects of success or whether it raises an issue that should in the public interest be examined by the court or whether the law requires clarifying.\n\"We were satisfied that there was no prospect of success disclosed in any of the grounds raised by the applicant,\" the Court of Appeal noted.\n\"This was not an instance of a weak case being advanced by an appellant, this case is stillborn. It was for these reasons that we dismissed the applicant's application for leave to appeal out of time. Ineluctably, the application for a stay was denied inasmuch as the dismissal of the leave application removed the basis for a stay.\"\nThe full ruling is now available on the appellate court's website."}
{"id":"e4bfba09-0667-433c-b54f-ead1b0b7df7c","text":"Part of the intake paperwork at any medical office includes questions about family history. As you check those boxes and list the causes of death of your close relatives, you might feel doomed by a legacy of heart disease. However, Debbie Leoni, MSA, RN and director of Cardiovascular Outreach Services for SoutheastHEALTH, would advise you to consider whether this is genetics or history. There is a difference. Think about what factors your family members had control over. Were they smokers? Did they rarely exercise? Did their diet include a lot of red meat? It may have not been their genetics that led to their heart disease, but their lifestyle. The good news is, you can make changes to write a new chapter about heart health in your family history.\nDawn Walston, APRN-BC, MSN with Cardiovascular Consultants, Southeast Hospital Cardiac Service Line, believes people can \"absolutely take control\" of their cardiac health by evaluating what they do on a daily basis when it comes to exercise and diet. Sometimes people are overwhelmed as they anticipate the changes they may have to make, but Walston encourages small steps. \"You don't have to be a gym rat. Just get up and move! If you can just walk beyond what you do at work for 15 minutes, three to five times a week, that will make a difference for your heart. You don't have to cut out all red meat, just reduce it. There are no evil foods. You can still have a treat once a week.\" The only thing that is \"all or nothing\" is smoking. Even one cigarette a day increases your risk of a heart attack.\nLeoni notes that our bodies are amazingly adaptable: \"they can adapt to damage, but they can also adapt to healing.\" For example, 20 minutes after a person stops smoking, his or her pulse and blood pressure begin to lower. Someone who smokes a pack a day is twice as likely to have a heart attack as a non-smoker, but if you go a whole day without a cigarette, you just lowered your chance of having one. After 15 years, the chances that you will develop heart disease are the same as a non-smoker.\nMedicine does not compensate for poor habits. While both Walston and Leoni want to encourage compliance with taking medication as prescribed by your doctor, they warn that \"you can't take extra cholesterol medicine so you can eat big greasy meals.\" There is no magic fix that replaces regular exercise and a healthy diet. In fact, Walston and Leoni pointed out that taking diet pills or drinking energy drinks to try to speed up weight loss can hurt your heart's electrical system.\nBut, what if it IS your genetics that contribute to your heart disease? Leoni knows that can be the case. She described a friend who worked out faithfully but knew, because of his genetics, he would probably have a heart attack one day. And he did. But, he was back in the gym just a couple of weeks later. His healthy habits had strengthened his heart, and he was able to make a quick and complete recovery.\nFamily history is not doomed to repeat itself. You can boost your quality of life and thrive rather than survive by improving your cardiac health.\nTo learn more, visit www.sehealth.org\/heartsmart."}

Phil Bryant signed into law a bill that prevents women from getting abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. His state, effective immediately, now holds the distinction of having the earliest abortion ban in the nation.\n\"As I have repeatedly said, I want Mississippi to be the safest place in America for an unborn child,\" Bryant tweeted this month in anticipation of the bill's passage. Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves echoed that sentiment Monday, tweeting \"It's a great day in Mississippi\" along with a picture of the signing.\nAlso known as the Gestational Age Act, Mississippi's new law makes exceptions only for medical emergencies or cases in which there's a \"severe fetal abnormality.\" There are no exceptions for incidents of rape or incest.\nThe law also puts physicians on notice. Doctors who perform abortions after 15 weeks will be required to submit reports detailing the circumstances. If they knowingly violate the law, their medical licenses will be suspended or revoked in Mississippi. If they falsify records, they will face civil penalties or be forced to pay fines of up to $500.\nThe measure is just one in a string of efforts to diminish access to abortions in Mississippi, critics say.\n\"Abortion is a safe medical procedure and it is a critical part of the broad spectrum of reproductive health care that a woman may use in her lifetime,\" said Felicia Brown-Williams, Mississippi state director for Planned Parenthood Southeast Advocates, in a statement. \"This ban is not only unconstitutional -- it endangers women's health care across our state. If legislators truly cared about women's health, they would be focused on ways to improve access to health care for women, not restrict it.\"\nAccess to abortions in Mississippi was already highly restrictive.\nIt is among a small handful of states that has one remaining clinic: in this case, Jackson Women's Health Organization. Although Mississippi is among the states with a 20-week ban, up until the enactment of this latest bill, the cutoff time for abortions at the Jackson clinic was 16 weeks. And since hospitals won't perform abortions, the resulting one-week change brought on by this new law is \"arbitrary,\" based on \"capricious whim\" and a way to \"feed political meat\" to a political base, said Dr. Willie Parker, board chairman of Physicians for Reproductive Health.\nMississippi is the only state in the country that requires physicians who perform abortions to be board-certified or board-eligible obstetrician-gynecologists, a fact that's being challenged in court as unconstitutional by the Center for Reproductive Rights. Parker, an OB\/GYN, explained that he could be trained in a plastic surgical procedure and be free to perform that procedure in Mississippi, even though he's not a board-certified plastic surgeon. But a family physician, a surgeon or an internist trained to perform abortions isn't given the same leeway.\nMississippi also requires in-person counseling and a 24-hour waiting period before receiving an abortion, which means women must make repeat trips to the facility -- a fact that's especially burdensome for those living outside Jackson. Health plans under the Affordable Care Act, insurance policies for public employees and public funding for abortions can be applied only in cases of rape, incest, fetal impairment or when a life is endangered, according to the Guttmacher Institute.\nAbout 2,000 women a year in Mississippi receive abortions, Parker said. The vast majority, 88%, receive them in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. So by 15 weeks, he estimates, 200 women in Mississippi who should have access to an abortion no longer will.\nFor women living in poverty who need time to gather resources to pay for an abortion and for those outside Jackson who need to find ways to cover additional expenses associated with travel, House Bill 1510 will close the door to a procedure that's been a legal right for women since the passage of Roe v. Wade in 1973.\nProponents of the bill, like Mississippi State Rep. Dan Eubanks, argue that this law will do what's best for women.\n\"Beyond the obvious debate of trying to save the lives of innocent babies, there is the often less discussed issues that relates to the health of the mother who receives an abortion,\" Eubanks wrote in an email. \"When did looking out for the life, health and overall wellbeing of a child or its mother start getting labeled as extreme in this country?\"\nEubanks says that the longer a woman carries a child in her womb, \"the greater the potential she will suffer from psychological, emotional, and physical damages as an outcome,\" though that contention is generally disputed by those who advocate for safe access to abortions.\nThe new Mississippi law is expected to be challenged in court.\nThe Center for Reproductive Rights points out that similar efforts in other states -- Arizona, North Dakota and Arkansas -- were shot down on constitutional grounds. And the advocacy group expects that this bill to ban \"pre-viability abortion\" will similarly be stopped.\n\"Mississippi politicians' flagrant assault on reproductive rights will not go unchallenged,\" said Lourdes Rivera, senior vice president of US programs at the Center for Reproductive Rights, in a written statement. \"This bill is dangerous and unconstitutional. The Center is prepared to answer any attempt to undermine 40 years of Supreme Court precedent with the full force of the law.\""}

The grey region is the zone, where liquid water could exist on the surface of the planets. On planet Trappist-1h liquid water is possible under a thick layer of ice. (1 AU is the distance between the Sun and the Earth.) A. Triaud\n\"This finding is a great example of how the scientific community is unleashing the power of complementary data from our different missions to make such fascinating discoveries,\" Zurbuchen added.\nTRAPPIST-1 is a dim, dwarf star just 8 percent as massive as the sun that lies about 40 light-years from Earth. In May 2016, astronomers using the TRAPPIST (Transiting Planets and Planetesimals Small Telescope) instrument in Chile announced the discovery of three roughly Earth-size planets in the system. That number jumped to seven with further observation by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, TRAPPIST and other ground-based telescopes.\nRelated: Search for Extraterrestrial Life Gets Help From Powerful New Tools\nThree of these seven worlds appear to orbit in TRAPPIST-1's \"habitable zone,\" meaning they might be able to host liquid water, and therefore life as we know it, on their surfaces.\nDespite such work, astronomers had not been able to pin down the path of TRAPPIST-1h. But they had noticed that the six other planets in the system are in \"orbital resonance.\" That is, the worlds have tugged each other into stable orbits whose periods are related to each other by a ratio of two small integers.\nThis illustration shows an artist view of the seven Trappist-1 planets NASA\/JPL-Caltech\nSimilarly, the Jupiter moons Io, Europa and Ganymede are in orbital resonance: For every lap Ganymede completes around Jupiter, Europa makes two orbits and Io completes four. The TRAPPIST-1 resonances are much more complex, but they adhere to the same principle.\nThe six planets' relationships with each other led the research team to propose six possible resonant orbits for TRAPPIST-1h. Various observations ruled out five of the six, but the sixth was confirmed with observations made by NASA's Kepler space telescope from December 2016 through March of this year, the scientists announced in the new study, which was published Monday (May 22) in the journal Nature Astronomy.\n\"The resonant structure is no coincidence and points to an interesting dynamical history in which the planets likely migrated inward in lockstep,\" lead author Rodrigo Luger, a doctoral student at the University of Washington in Seattle, said in the same statement. \"This makes the system a great test bed for planet-formation and -migration theories.\"\nRelated: Mysterious 'Alien Megastructure' Star Is at It Again\nTRAPPIST-1 holds the record for most planets found in orbital resonance. Second place is a tie between the exoplanetary systems Kepler-80 and Kepler-223, each of which is known to harbor four resonant worlds.\nTRAPPIST-1h receives about the same amount of energy from its star as the dwarf planet Ceres, the largest object in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, gets from Earth's sun, NASA officials said. So TRAPPIST-1h is most likely a frigid world unable to host Earth-like life, they added.\nBut that may not always have been the case. The star TRAPPIST-1 is thought to be between 3 billion and 8 billion years old. It was likely much brighter in its youth, perhaps bright enough to make TRAPPIST-1 habitable for several hundred million years in the ancient past, Luger said.\nFollow Mike Wall on Twitter @michaeldwall and Google+.

His Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s sweep was incomplete\u2014the BJP lost one state and will rule only in coalition in two others\u2014but the BJP triumphed dramatically in mega-state Uttar Pradesh.\nThere the BJP forged a broad coalition to overcome caste politics and staged an effective grassroots campaign. Modi, rather than local leaders, acted as the BJP\u2019s public face. The Observer Research Foundation\u2019s Ashok Malik called it \u201ca stupendous achievement.\u201d Even the Congress Party\u2019s Kapil Sibal acknowledged: \u201cNo doubt, it\u2019s an astounding victory for the BJP.\u201d\nThe result strengthens the ruling party\u2019s influence in the Rajya Sabha, the nation\u2019s upper house, which it still does not control, and positions the BJP for reelection in national elections for the more important lower house, or Lok Sabha, two years hence. Modi parlayed a mix of business friendliness, reputation for competence, and Hindu nationalism into a stunning national victory in 2014, humiliating the long-dominant Congress Party.\nToday, with the latter\u2019s dynastic leadership in decline, the BJP appears to be the natural governing party. No politician has enjoyed such sway for years. Observed Sandeep Shastri of Jain University: \u201cModi represents that national-level figure that we\u2019ve not seen since Indira Gandhi,\u201d the Congress Party prime minister assassinated more than three decades ago.\nModi also has made an international impact, raising his country\u2019s profile. He represents a people on their way to greatness. Today India has the world\u2019s fastest growing economy and second-largest population\u2014on its way to becoming the largest. English is commonly spoken and ethnic Indians are productive traders around the world. Several years ago the Cato Institute\u2019s Swaminathan S. Anklesaria Aiyar noted that India\u2019s diaspora, at more than 30 million worldwide, is another source of economic strength and international influence for the homeland. The number of Indian students studying at American universities is second only to those from China.\nNevertheless, Indian voters were most interested in bettering their lives domestically. Indians long languished in poverty as their leaders followed a collectivist, dirigiste economic strategy. New Delhi imposed confiscatory tax rates, employed a bureaucracy rated the worst in Asia, nicknamed the \u201cLicense Raj,\u201d and controlled the economy\u2019s commanding heights. Indian politicians pushed industrialization, but focusing on capital and skill-intensive industries, acting \u201cagainst its comparative advantage,\u201d explained HDFC Bank, since \u201cIndia\u2019s comparative advantage lay in an abundance of relatively low-skilled workforce.\u201d Indeed, New Delhi was not only a political friend but also an economic mimic of the Soviet Union.\nThe consequences for the Indian people were catastrophic. Growth lagged behind numerous other developing nations; until 1983 the poverty rate was about 60 percent. There were brief attempts at economic liberalization in 1966 and 1985, but both elite and popular resistance remained strong. Real progress occurred in 1991, freeing Indians to be more entrepreneurial. Eric D. Dixon and Tarun Vats of the Atlas Network reported: \u201cWithin a decade, the average income in India had doubled, and nearly 250 million people\u2014about a fifth of the population\u2014have risen out of poverty since then.\u201d\nHowever, progress remained incomplete, especially compared to China, which became a global economic powerhouse. Explained Aiyar in a recent Cato Institute study, \u201cAlthough many old controls have been abolished, many still continue, and a plethora of new controls have been created.\u201d Indians\u2019 economic liberty actually peaked in the mid-2000s.\nThe 2014 Economic Freedom of the World report, the most recent ranking, rated India a disappointing 112 out of 159 nations, down from 102 the previous year. (India did substantially better on personal freedom, coming in at 77.) The Heritage Foundation\u2019s 2017 Index of Economic Freedom rated India at 143 of 180 countries, well behind China at 111. India\u2019s rating dropped from the year before, and New Delhi did particularly badly on investment freedom, financial freedom, labor freedom, government integrity, judicial effectiveness, and business freedom.\nAlthough growth increased after liberalization, India failed to overtake China as had been predicted. Since 2013 growth rates have accelerated, though pulling 86 percent of India\u2019s money out of circulation late last year had a negative effect. The International Monetary Fund originally forecast growth of 7.4 percent this year, but cut the estimate to 6.6 percent.\nOther caution lights are blinking. Growth has been driven by government spending rather than private investment, and India\u2019s per capita GDP growth dropped early in the decade, a bad sign for future economic progress. Moreover, job growth remains weak. It first slowed markedly in 2012 but has not recovered under the current government, which according to HDFC Bank, indicates a \u201cgrowing disconnect between economic growth, education, skilling and jobs.\u201d\nNevertheless, India could pull ahead with better policies. The McKinsey Quarterly contended that deregulation would kick growth rates up to ten percent. Inflation is lower than in other \u201cemerging markets\u201d and the Economist Intelligence Unit rates New Delhi\u2019s \u201ccountry risk\u201d below that of China. Growing wealth is spurring domestic demand: India\u2019s \u201cconsuming class\u201d is expected to treble during the coming decade. Democracy provides a political safety valve not present in China.\nModi\u2019s 2014 triumph reflected his pro-business record as chief minister of the state of Gujarat and the widespread belief that he would transform national economic policy as well. However, despite his big win and large parliamentary majority, his government has moved only slowly to free the economy. For instance, the Times of India (New Delhi) complained about the slow \u201cimplementation of projects\u201d and that \u201cthe government hasn\u2019t pressed the pedal hard on reforms.\u201d Business Standard (New Delhi) columnist Shankar Acharya warned: \u201cEconomic reforms have clearly lost momentum and there is a sense of drift in economic policy.\u201d\nIn part this reflects opposition control of the Rajya Sabha, whose membership changes only with state government control. However, New Delhi\u2019s failure to liberalize more also appears to reflect the fact that Modi believes not so much in free markets as in better managed markets. So, too, does the BJP. Milan Vaishnav of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace noted the party\u2019s \u201cnationalist, protectionist wing will also demand a pound of flesh\u201d after the UP victory. Moreover, Sebastian Mallaby of the Council on Foreign Relations argued that Modi \u201cseems stuck in the mindset of a provincial executive: he is more interested in projects than in policies; he is a modernizer, not a reformer.\u201d\nThe demonetization project is a dramatic example of a Modi policy expanding government control over people\u2019s economic lives. Other counterproductive initiatives include agricultural price controls and attacks on \u201choarding.\u201d Worse, according to the Telegraph (Calcutta): \u201cthe Modi government has started to drum up the virtues of creating large state-owned assets in a throwback to a Nehruvian era of creating state monopolies in strategic areas.\u201d This is a prescription for economic stasis.\nStill, the Modi government has restrained spending, sped environmental regulatory approvals, eliminated capital and certification barriers for new businesses, streamlined distribution of welfare benefits, improved sanitation, and attempted to move poorer Indians into the financial system. New Delhi also has begun to improve the electrical grid and transportation infrastructure. Perhaps most important have been passage of a new bankruptcy code and a uniform goods and services tax (GST) to replace a complex and confusing hodge-podge of regional and national taxes (though the new levy itself seems more complicated than necessary). In January the government eased limits on foreign direct investment, including in the aviation, defense, and pharmaceutical sectors.\nThese are important steps. However, much more remains to be done. Eswar Prasad of Cornell argued that the government must demonstrate its commitment \u201cto deep-rooted reforms including reducing labor regulations, unshackling businesses from red tape and bureaucracy, reducing government control of banks and clearing up their bad loans, developing capital markets, revamping the government\u2019s tax and expenditure systems and improving infrastructure.\u201d\nFor instance, New Delhi should end the web of government controls over business hiring and firing. Companies with at least 100 employees generally require government permission to cut staff, which is one reason nine out of ten Indians work in the informal economy. Noted the OECD: \u201cIn labor markets, employment growth has been concentrated in firms that operate in sectors not covered by India\u2019s highly restrictive labor laws.\u201d In contrast, in highly regulated areas employment has been falling. Moreover, contract employees account for almost half of the workforce at large industrial firms, compared to under nine percent in service enterprises.\nThe American Enterprise Institute\u2019s Derek Scissors observed that such restrictions \u201cessentially guarantee mass underemployment and an India that, unlike its neighbors in East Asia, cannot benefit from global demand for manufactured goods.\u201d Yet one unnamed BJP official told the Telegraph (Kolkata): \u201cif it\u2019s a conflict between a corporate entity and its workers, we have to be on the side of the workers.\u201d Even though those workers would most benefit from new and better positions in place of their current jobs.\nModi also should dismantle the state economic sector which has expanded dramatically over the last couple of decades. Losses from public enterprises run billions of dollars annually. Among the biggest problems are public-sector banks. Profits are down and negative overall. These institutions hold 70 percent of the nation\u2019s financial assets: alas, more than a sixth of the loans are \u201cstressed,\u201d many unable to even pay interest. Problem loans total roughly $200 billion, reducing credit for productive enterprises and increasing chances of a financial crisis.\nIn fact, many companies fear the future. Sales growth and capacity utilization are low compared to the past, and business confidence is the lowest in two years. Reported the Economist in early March:\u201dIf India is indeed the world\u2019s fastest-growing big economy, as its government once again claimed last week, no one told its bankers and business leaders. In a nation of 1.3 billion steadily growing at around seven percent a year, the mood in corner offices ought to be jubilant. Instead, firms are busy cutting back investment as if mired in recession. Bank lending to industry, growth in which once reached 30 percent a year, is shrinking for the first time in over two decades.\u201d\nNew Delhi should respond by accelerating reforms. A foreign investor told Open Magazine last year; \u201cThe BJP underestimated the extent of the problem\u201d and concentrated on \u201clow-hanging fruits.\u201d However, spurring manufacturing and reviving banks required more than \u201ca few quick fixes.\u201d India also needs a change in economic philosophy, as public support for statism if not old-fashioned socialism endures. Economist Mohan Guruswamy of the Center for Policy Alternatives observed that \u201cThere is still a distrust of private capital and foreign capital, and a consensus on state control of industries that cuts across parties. People still want a lifetime of employment, a lifetime of assured income.\u201d\nFinally, government must perform better when it acts. India remains a poor nation, so government welfare is no surprise. However, there are nearly 1000 national programs, supplemented by various state initiatives. The result, said Aiyar, is \u201ca bewildering variety of freebies,\u201d many to the well-off. Complained the Economist: \u201cthe plethora of schemes in place for Indians to claim subsidized food, fuel, gas, electricity and so on are inefficient and corrupt.\u201d Better to consolidate the in-kind benefits into individual cash payments. The latter would reduce inefficiency and corruption and return decision-making to the poor.\nMoreover, observed Aiyar in his Cato study: \u201cWith almost no exceptions, the delivery of government services in India is pathetic, from the police and judiciary to education and health. Unsackable government staff members have no accountability to the people they are supposed to serve, and so callousness, corruption, and waste are common.\u201d A mix of privatization and better management are necessary.\nUnfortunately, India\u2019s economy may suffer from the ongoing surge in Hindu nationalism. Modi got his start in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or RSS, which promotes Hindu nationalism. While in Gujarat he was blamed for mob violence that killed hundreds of Muslims, though his responsibility was never proved. Religious persecution and intolerance, long present in India, have worsened with his 2014 victory. Warned the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom in a report issued last month: \u201cthreats, hate crimes, social boycotts, desecration of places of worship, assaults, and forced conversions led by radical Hindu nationalist movements have escalated dramatically under the BJP-led government.\u201d\nMost violence occurs at the state level, beyond the prime minister\u2019s direct reach. However, the BJP has pandered to Hindu nationalists. For instance, in the recent election Modi accused the ruling local party of favoring Muslims. After the BJP victory he appointed as UP\u2019s chief minister a parliamentarian who doubles as Hindu priest and violent provocateur. Indeed, Yogi Adityanath was briefly jailed for his incendiary rhetoric against Muslims. He also has pushed for building a Hindu temple on the site of a mosque destroyed years ago by a mob, which triggered deadly sectarian violence.\nTo the extent these violent currents ripple outward, foreign investment could suffer. Warned Manu Bhagavan of Hunter College, such \u201cregressive identity politics \u2026 are more about the last century than the next.\u201d\nIndia is gaining economically. But continuing liberal reform is necessary to sustain strong economic growth. Modi is India\u2019s most popular politician and dominates the national political landscape. So far he has only cautiously pushed economic reforms, but voters have credited him with making an effort, even forgiving the bungled currency reform since it was targeted at the well-off. He has two years left before the next national contest.\nAfter the election Jain University political scientist Sandeep Shastri predicted that Modi \u201cwill likely try for some measures in the coming months that will capture the imagination of voters that will help him win in 2019.\u201d But that wouldn\u2019t necessarily be economic liberalization. After being accused of running a \u201csuit-boot\u201d administration too friendly with corporate elites, he turned more populist. Novelist Pankaj Mishra argued that Modi relied on ressentiment by \u201cpresenting himself as a relentless scourge of elites and sentinel of the upwardly mobile.\u201d The Brookings Institute\u2019s Tanvi Madan predicted that Modi will move forward on the anti-corruption front, which \u201cis something that resonates with people.\u201d\nDoes Modi want free the economy? Madan contended that \u201cIt\u2019s been established that he is not a free-market guy.\u201d Indeed, Modi looks ever less like Ronald Reagan, to whom the prime minister once was compared, and more like Donald Trump, argued Ruchir Sharma of Morgan Stanley Investment Management. Polls indicate that Indians increasingly want a strong leader, and Modi is \u201cconcentrating power in his own hands, thus shifting the driver of economic growth from the private sector to the state.\u201d The ironic result may be a better managed but not much freer economy."}

Our last column was about an email from Randy Brown, the executive director of Friends of Riverdale Park West, and his acute dislike of the new signs placed in the park as part of a city pilot project.\nThe new signs in Riverdale Park, part of a city pilot project encompassing a \"wayfinding strategy\" that extends far beyond parks, seems to meet with widespread approval from readers. ( JACK LAKEY FOR THE TORONTO STAR )\nBrown described them as \u201cugly,\u201d and said the city did not consult with the local community before installing them, adding he met with city officials involved in the project who would not explain themselves to him. The parks department gave us information that shows the city consulted with the public on the wayfinding project, which has been brewing since 2014, and that most people who took part in a survey approved of them. That had us wondering how Star readers feel about the signs, so we asked for comments and received upward of 20 emails, with only a couple that were critical.\nArticle Continued Below\nWriter and teacher Beth Kaplan sent us a note taking issue with Brown\u2019s assertion that the city did not consult with the locals at Riverdale Park. \u201cThey put up several test panels and asked for feedback; city staff were around for extensive periods asking everyone who passed by what they thought, and taking notes,\u201d said Kaplan. \u201cThese signs are not lovely but informative and useful. Let\u2019s move right along.\u201d \u201cI like those signs,\u201d said Kirk LeMessurier, who identified himself as a local resident. \u201cI think they have a modern, clean feel and are attractive.\u201d \u201cAs soon as I saw the headline I knew this had to be someone from Cabbagetown complaining,\u201d said John Maynard. \u201cIf heritage committees in Cabbagetown are against the new signs, I am all for them!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m in the park at least twice a day with my dogs and I can\u2019t begin to tell you how many people I see consulting the signs,\u201d said Dave Fraser. \u201cMr. Brown does not speak for all the neighbourhood. There are many of us who are grateful for the signs and were pleased to see them installed.\u201d Lilian Hulme-Smith asked a good question: \u201cIs there Braille on the signs, and does the coloring fall under what is within the best viewing range for people with low vision?\u201d\nArticle Continued Below\nMichael Reynolds was the only reader who agreed with Brown, saying, \u201cthey\u2019re terrible. Not in terms of function, but in terms of design execution.\u201d \u201cI think the signs are bright, easy to see and full of useful information,\u201d said Tawnya Hallman. \u201cWhile the colour may not be for everyone, is there a colour that is? \u201cThere are hard working people behind projects like this in Toronto, who are smart, qualified and thoughtful. It bothers me when people cast a shadow on their hard work.\u201d After so many positive comments, it looks like the new signage may be a done deal. And they\u2019re part of a larger initiative to improve the way people navigate the entire city; what\u2019s wrong with that? It\u2019s still not too late to offer feedback to the city.

I think we should work out more ways to do this kind of thing.\"\nThe top 10 rankings are laden with 20-somethings, including Australian world number one Jason Day and Northern Ireland's second-ranked Rory McIlroy, but in the sport's traditional markets, fans and participants are ageing and thinning.\nAustralia, where huge crowds once flocked to local courses when favourite son Greg Norman was in his pomp, has battled to attract sponsors and fans to its marquee events in recent years, while struggling to arrest declining rates of participation.\nGolf tourism fuelled by international visitors has taken up some of the slack for the embattled industry but scores of lower-profile private clubs have slashed fees to lure new members.\nAustralia has never wanted for a pioneering spirit, however, and local sports have gladly ditched tradition in a bid to innovate and open new markets.\nThe nation's domestic Twenty20 cricket competition, the 'Big Bash', has proved an outrageous success since its inaugural tournament in 2011-12, its glitzy mix of sport and entertainment drawing huge attendances and television audiences.\nThe national athletics federation has also attempted to foment revolution with the recent staging of the inaugural Nitro Series in Melbourne, where Usain Bolt and his 'All-Star' internationals competed against five nations in a team-based event held over three meetings. [nL4N1FW066]\nOrganisers promise a similarly relaxed and informal atmosphere at Lake Karrinyup, where there will be live music, DJs and a specially built 90-metre 'shootout hole' to act as a tie-breaker for pairs who halve their six-hole matchplay duels.\nBut with the tournament still dominated by conventional strokeplay over the opening three days, it will not be so revolutionary as to upset the silver-haired set.\n\"This tournament is not to say that strokeplay events aren't still popular,\" Ayles added. \"They are immensely popular around the world. This really just provides an alternative.\n\"If all goes well, we would certainly consider expanding this across Australia and then potentially, Europe and Asia.\"\n($1 = A$1.3029)\n(Editing by John O'Brien)"}

To gain a stronger hold on the market, companies are seen focusing on untapped regional markets with vast unmet needs.

The market in Asia Pacific, however, is expected to emerge as the most promising regional market in terms of new growth opportunities.

Changing lifestyles, rapidly melting social, religious, and ethical barriers, and late pregnancies are also leading to a significant surge in the uptake of oral contraceptive pills globally.\nHowever, the market continues to be limited by social and religious barriers across a number of conservative developed as well as developing countries. Thus a large population of women across the globe confined by these factors is either unable to acquire contraceptives or are required to abstain from the usage of any form of contraceptives.

Neil Tappin offers his US Open 2018 Verdict about a tournament that will be remembered as much for the organisers as the winner.\nDid the USGA go too far? US Open 2018 Verdict\nBrooks Koepka may have emerged from the pack to claim his second consecutive US Open title, but this major will be remembered as much for controversy and farce as for the golf itself. That we are left talking more about the organisers than the winner, tells you all you need to know about what is becoming an annual pantomime that divides the golf-watching public.\nLet\u2019s be clear from the start, the US Open has, over many years, developed a reputation as the hardest of the four golf majors. Win this one and you can rightly call yourself one of the game\u2019s greats \u2013 that\u2019s the theory. Indeed, watching the world\u2019s best players struggle to tame a truly brutal test can make for captivating viewing. As a \u2018USP\u2019, this makes perfect sense.\nUS Open Leaderboard 2018\nAnd yet, golf is a sport that does not need to be reinvented. In recent history the US Open has given us a 300-yard par 3 and a 546-yard par 4. Sixty-yard wide fairways and rough you could lose a toddler in have now become the norm. At Chambers Bay in 2015 (a golf course that was only opened in 2007), the USGA exposed the greens to warm and windy conditions without water. The putting surfaces were not mature enough or frankly, good enough, to do this and in the end they deteriorated to such a degree that you wouldn\u2019t have wanted to host the monthly medal on them, let alone the US Open.\nLesson learned, surely?\nWell, not exactly. This year, the USGA under the stewardship of Chief Executive Mike Davis, took things a step further. On day three of the Championship, a combination of sun and strong winds made the course play incredibly fast. The biggest mistake was placing pins on the edges of slopes. Great shots were routinely punished, skill played second fiddle to luck and the final four groups had an accumulative total of 46-over par. Playing well over the first two days and getting a late tee time became a punishment.\nUS Open Prize Money 2018\nOf course, the farcical nature of the test received a fittingly farcical moment. When Phil Mickelson hit his ball while it was in motion, it created a furore over whether Lefty should have been disqualified. Regardless of which side of the fence you sit, this was the action of a mind clouded by a tricked up golf course. It was pure frustration that led Mickelson to make this mistake but in so doing, he sent a clear message to the organisers. If you do silly things to the course, you\u2019ll get a silly reaction from the players. It was a moment unbefitting of a major sporting event.\nAs for Shinnecock Hills, this truly magnificent old layout was made to look foolish. Every amateur golfer should want to play this incredible course and yet, how many people watching were salivating at the prospect of putting their own game\u2019s through this trauma? Is this what the original designers had in mind when they created the first layout here over a 125 years ago?\nAnd so, yet again, we find ourselves dissecting the actions of the USGA rather than the miraculous play of the winner. The lessons of past US Open mistakes have clearly not been learned. Like a referee stealing the limelight in the World Cup final, the USGA seem hell bent on making this tournament about them.\nThe USGA should watch how the R&A set up their courses for the Open Championship. There is no mythical scoring figure in mind, instead the players get what Mother Nature gives them. If, in the build up to the Open we have a warm, wet summer, the rough will be naturally thick and lush. That also means the greens will be relatively soft and receptive. If strong winds are forecast, pins are placed in flat areas. If the forecast changes, the scoring improves \u2013 so what?\nIn their quest to make the examination paper of the US Open the toughest in the game, the USGA have gone too far. Again."}
{"id":"c775d97d-5e0b-41b4-a26b-55ce344bd4be","text":"And that's a wrap.\nThe 2016 season ended moments ago, with the New England Patriots' 34-28 overtime victory over the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI. The Patriots and Falcons have now joined the rest of the NFL in the offseason, where preparations for the 2017 campaign are well underway.\nYou know what that means, right? It's never too early -- or maybe, in this one case, it is just a bit -- for Power Rankings. What follows is an initial rendering from our ESPN voting panel (a group of more than 80 writers, editors and TV personalities) of how the league might stack up next season.\nClick here to see the final regular-season rankings of 2016.\n2016 record: 14-2\nWhy they're here: It's tough to pick against coach Bill Belichick to field an elite team -- especially after the Patriots compiled the league's best record in a season that began with quarterback Tom Brady's four-game suspension. Brady will turn 40 in August, but for the moment, he is backed up by two quarterbacks who won starts without him in 2016. More than anything, this season reaffirmed Belichick's unique ability to build a team out of what other teams might consider indiscriminate parts.\nWhat could change: The big question looming over the Patriots is when Brady will start playing to his age. It has to happen sometime, right? That will be the point when we start questioning the Patriots' short- and long-term fortunes. Trade rumors around backup Jimmy Garoppolo are illuminating. Would the Patriots really trade a player with such upside when their starter is nearing his 40th birthday?\n2016 record: 11-5\nWhy they're here: The Falcons had the best offense in the league in 2016, and that does not appear to be a one-year wonder. Quarterback Matt Ryan led the NFL in QBR and won the league MVP, receiver Julio Jones was unguardable, and the tailback duo of Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman were more than complementary. From a personnel standpoint, the Falcons are poised for another high-scoring season.\nWhat could change: The Falcons will suffer a big loss in offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan, who will leave to be the 49ers' head coach. Ryan has plenty of experience in changing offensive coordinators, but he clicked better with Shanahan than with any of his previous coaches. Personnel is the most important part of success, but changing schemes can be tricky. The Falcons' defense, meanwhile, had a deficient pass rush in 2016, which went largely unnoticed amid Vic Beasley Jr.'s 15.5 sacks. Atlanta ranked No. 27 in pressure rate (24.9), a weakness that could have more impact next season.\n2016 record: 13-3\nWhy they're here: The Cowboys were good enough to thrive after losing their top two quarterbacks before training camp began, and they are now positioned well for the long term at a number of key positions. Quarterback Dak Prescott (age 23) ranked No. 3 in QBR (83.0), and tailback Ezekiel Elliott (21) led the league in rushing (1,631), aided by arguably the NFL's best offensive line. It was, and will be, a strong combination.\nWhat could change: The Cowboys could get a boost if linebacker Jaylon Smith, a second-round pick in 2016, can get back on the field after a knee injury cost him his rookie season. But the Cowboys' biggest issue in 2016, and one that could impair their run at a Super Bowl title, was a weak pass rush. They ranked No. 30 in the NFL with a 22.7 pressure rate. That's an especially glaring weakness in a playoff game against a top quarterback, and it could impact the Cowboys' 2017 fortunes.\n2016 record: 10-6\nWhy they're here: Teams that finish the season hot leave behind strong memories. The Packers rode an eight-game winning streak into the NFC Championship Game, bolstered by arguably the best series of games in quarterback Aaron Rodgers' career. By the end, the Packers seemed to have solved the offensive issues that caused them a 4-6 start. Converted receiver Ty Montgomery appears to be a legitimate running back, and receiver Jordy Nelson finally made it all the way back from his torn ACL.\nWhat could change: The Packers' defensive collapse in the NFC Championship Game -- they allowed 493 total yards to the Falcons -- was a reminder of their serial deficiency on that side of the ball in the Rodgers era. They must reckon with that fact alongside a scary realization that linebacker Clay Matthews will be 31 next season; he has had only one double-digit sack season in the past four. Defensive end Julius Peppers, 37, is a pending free agent. That's two of the Packers' top defensive playmakers.\n2016 record: 10-5-1\nWhy they're here: Frankly, the Seahawks enjoy a national perspective as a team that plays lockdown defense and benefits from a quarterback in Russell Wilson who can mask any deficiency. Closer observers know that was not always the case in 2016, but the causes presumably can be rectified. Most important is the expected return of safety Earl Thomas, whose broken leg corresponded with a significant dip in defensive production. Opposing quarterbacks completed 65.3 percent of their passes in the games after his injury, with eight touchdowns and no interceptions.\nWhat could change: To maintain this lofty status, the Seahawks will need a better offseason of personnel additions than they've had in recent years. Their offensive line still needs upgrading. They must address a defense with aging stars. Defensive lineman Michael Bennett will be 32 next season. Defensive end Cliff Avril will be 31, safety Kam Chancellor and cornerback Richard Sherman will be 29, and Thomas will be 28.\n2016 record: 11-5\nWhy they're here: Voters aren't taking seriously the possibility that quarterback Ben Roethlisberger could retire this offseason, a possibility he discussed shortly after the Steelers' loss in the AFC Championship Game. It is difficult to imagine backup Landry Jones as an appropriate successor. Assuming Roethlisberger returns, the Steelers have shown the team that they can be when he's on the field with receiver Antonio Brown and running back Le'Veon Bell.\nWhat could change: The Steelers are 3-11 against the Patriots in the past 19 seasons, including playoffs, and must decide whether they need to try something different to overcome New England in the AFC. Bell is eligible for a new contract, and Brown's behavior throughout the season and playoffs has called into question his long-term future with the franchise. That's a lot of uncertainty for a team ranked No. 6, but the assumption is that there will not be wholesale changes.\n2016 record: 12-4\nWhy they're here: The franchise turned a major corner with the ascendance of quarterback Derek Carr, who was having an MVP-caliber season and had the Raiders poised for a playoff run before he broke his leg in Week 16. Carr proved to be a transcendent player, as demonstrated by the Raiders' hapless playoff exit in the wild-card game, but this is not a one-man team. General manager Reggie McKenzie has built one of the NFL's best offensive lines, boosted by free-agent signings and strong drafts, giving the Raiders a dangerously balanced offense. They had the sixth-most rushing yards in the NFL (1,922) to go with Carr.\nWhat could change: An unexpected transition at offensive coordinator is worth monitoring. Quarterbacks coach Todd Downing was promoted to replace Bill Musgrave, whose contract was not renewed. On paper, it will be difficult to improve substantially on an offense that ranked No. 6 in scoring (25.6 points per game). Downing is close with Carr, however. The Raiders also will address a defense that allowed 375.1 yards per game (No. 26 in NFL) but minimized damage by forcing 30 turnovers.\n2016 record: 12-4\nWhy they're here: You can at least count on a winning record from the Chiefs under coach Andy Reid, who has pulled that off in each of his four seasons with the franchise. The Chiefs were the best they've been under Reid in 2016, riding a defense that forced an NFL-high 33 turnovers and an offense that got playmaking from tight end Travis Kelce (1,125 receiving yards) and newcomer Tyreek Hill (12 total touchdowns). There is every reason to believe the Chiefs will continue to at least be a regular-season success in 2017.\nWhat could change: The Chiefs must decide whether they can take the next step with quarterback Alex Smith, a cool and efficient operator who threw just 15 touchdown passes in 15 starts in 2016 and has never thrown for more than 23 touchdowns in any season. Would Reid pursue, say, Tony Romo to better capitalize on what might be a championship window? A new quarterback would certainly shake up the Chiefs' 2017 fortunes, either for good or for bad.\n2016 record: 11-5\nWhy they're here: The Giants' defense took a major jump after a series of offseason additions, allowing the NFL's second-lowest points average (17.8 per game) and forcing 25 turnovers, tied for 11th in the NFL. The emergence of All-Pro safety Landon Collins and the consistency of defensive tackle Damon Harrison, who had the best approximate value (via Pro Football Reference) of any Giants defender in 2016, was especially promising. There is reason to believe that defense can be a strength of the Giants for years to come.\nWhat could change: Teams always are smart to emphasize their superstar playmakers, but the Giants were too reliant on receiver Odell Beckham Jr. in 2016. He accounted for nearly twice as many yards from scrimmage (1,376) as any of his teammates. Without offseason improvement, an extended absence from Beckham would cripple the offense. The Giants will spend the offseason looking for ways to be more well-rounded.\n2016 record: 9-7\nWhy they're here: Although they missed the playoffs, the Broncos didn't slip much defensively. They ranked fourth in scoring defense (18.6 points per game) and fifth in sack percentage (7.6 percent of opposing dropbacks). Entering a season with a new coach (Vance Joseph) and possibly a new quarterback (Tony Romo? Paxton Lynch?) leaves their short-term arc in doubt, but this team is structured well.\nWhat could change: The Broncos have a decent idea what they have in quarterback Trevor Siemian: a level-headed young player with an average arm and below-average accuracy. (His off-target percentage of 20.9 ranked No. 27 in the NFL.) There is more upside for the offense if Lynch wins the starting job, especially with new offensive coordinator Mike McCoy, a great strategist despite his failure as the Chargers' head coach, calling plays.\n2016 record: 6-10\nWhy they're here: On one hand, this is a team that won the NFC South in three consecutive years from 2013-15. Quarterback Cam Newton is just one year removed from an MVP season and will be only 28 when the 2017 season begins. Coach Ron Rivera retains a strong following in the locker room. Those are all strong signs. On the other hand, Newton showed signs of wear in 2016 after years of extra hits absorbed via the run or long duration time in the pocket. It seems clear that a change in Newton's playing style is at hand; his 90 rushes in 2016 were a career low.\nWhat could change: A draft loaded with running backs could take some pressure off Newton, and there could be some intriguing options available in free agency to address key needs. Would Vikings left tackle Matt Kalil join his brother, Panthers center Ryan Kalil, in Carolina? That might make some sense and would be an upgrade. The Panthers are projected to have more than $50 million in salary-cap space. The long-term future of linebacker Luke Kuechly, who didn't play after a Week 11 concussion, could impact the franchise's direction.\n2016 record: 8-7-1\nWhy they're here: A clear shot at the playoffs slipped away via losses in four of the Redskins' final six games, including in Week 17 at home against the Giants, but they remain a franchise on the playoff fringe. The next step is clear. In plays of heightened importance in 2016, the Redskins weren't good enough to convert on either side of the ball. Their defense allowed the NFL's highest third-down conversion rate (46.6), and their offense ranked 29th in red zone efficiency (45.9 percent). Quarterback Kirk Cousins has thrown for 9,083 yards the past two seasons, but his Week 17 fourth-quarter interception scuttled Washington's playoff hopes.\nWhat could change: The Redskins realized they needed a new direction on defense but wound up promoting linebackers coach Greg Manusky to replace fired defensive coordinator Joe Barry after failing to attract an external candidate. Manusky will be better off if general manager Scott McCloughan can upgrade at safety and defensive line this offseason. A long-term contract for Cousins could also smooth the nervous edge off his performances.\n2016 record: 8-8\nWhy they're here: The Ravens have missed the playoffs and had non-winning seasons in three of the four seasons since they won Super Bowl XLVII. The last time that happened in Baltimore, coach Brian Billick was fired. Owner Steve Bisciotti spared coach John Harbaugh this time around. There is institutional respect for Harbaugh's work. But the general downward trend leaves outside observers to debate where he is headed: for a Bill Cowher-like second wind or for the end of a highly successful tenure that has run its course.\nWhat could change: The addition of Greg Roman as a senior offensive assistant\/tight ends coach could serve as a balance to offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg's pass-happy playcalls. (The Ravens led the NFL with 679 pass attempts in 2016, while their 367 carries were the third fewest.) General manager Ozzie Newsome also could help his defense by adding a pass-rusher, as Terrell Suggs approaches his 35th birthday and Elvis Dumervil (33) faces an uncertain future.\n2016 record: 9-7\nWhy they're here: The Lions were a surprise playoff participant, but eight of their victories came via fourth-quarter comebacks engineered by quarterback Matthew Stafford. With a chance to win the NFC North, they lost their final three regular-season games. Then they turned in a dud in a wild-card loss at the Seahawks. As such, it's fair to wonder if the team benefited from above-average quarterback play and a coincidental series of unlikely events, rather than having put itself on a consistent playoff track.\nWhat could change: Some of the Lions' offseason will depend on what they do, if anything, with Stafford's contract. It expires after the 2017 season, and there is no reason to believe he would come more cheaply at that point. With more than $40 million in projected cap space, the Lions are in position to distribute his cap hit evenly, rather than backload it, as they have done in previous deals. They also could help him by balancing an offense that tied for the fewest rushing attempts (350) in the NFL in 2016.\n2016 record: 9-7\nWhy they're here: The Texans enter the offseason as they always do: without an established starting quarterback. They probably maxed out in 2016 with the disappointing Brock Osweiler. His short- and long-range accuracy was brutal, resulting in the NFL's seventh-worst off-target percentage, and his average of 5.26 yards per dropback was the NFL's worst. In other words, no quarterback was less productive on a per-pass basis.\nWhat could change: The Texans probably will have to replace Osweiler -- possibly with Tony Romo -- even though they owe him $16 million in 2017. Their defense, already stingy by AFC South standards (20.5 points per game), should welcome back a healthy J.J. Watt to match with Jadeveon Clowney,?who broke through with his first Pro Bowl season in 2016. The Texans already have managed a smooth transition to defensive coordinator Mike Vrabel from incumbent Romeo Crennel, who will remain on staff.\n2016 record: 7-8-1\nWhy they're here: No glance at the Cardinals can begin without noting the dramatic weakening of their explosive passing game. Their team average of yards per attempt dropped from No. 1 in the NFL in 2015 (8.5 yards) to No. 23 in 2016 (6.85). That's the meat of coach Bruce Arians' offense. As quarterback Carson Palmer approaches his 38th birthday -- or possibly retirement -- it's fair to wonder if personnel and schematic tweaks alone can produce a bounce-back year in 2017. Also, can the Cardinals really count on much more than they got from tailback David Johnson, who led the NFL in yards from scrimmage (2,118)?\nWhat could change: The Cardinals could inspire longer-term confidence by demonstrating a plan beyond the Palmer- Larry Fitzgerald duo. Fitzgerald, who turns 34 in August, caught 107 passes in 2016 but ranked 84th among receivers with an average of 9.6 yards per catch. Adding a big, downfield target will help the Cardinals re-establish their schematic roots.\n2016 record: 9-7\nWhy they're here: A 6-2 finish, powered by a much-improved defense, wasn't enough to satisfy observers who last saw this franchise make the playoffs 10 years ago. (The Buccaneers' most recent playoff victory was 14 years ago in Super Bowl XXXVII.) But there is plenty to build on here. Tampa Bay had the NFL's fourth-best scoring defense (17.1 points per game) over the final eight weeks of the season, and the duo of quarterback Jameis Winston and receiver Mike Evans is promising.\nWhat could change: General manager Jason Licht will have a projected $65 million in cap space if he wants to augment the roster. Some of that will be needed for a Winston contract extension, which could come as early as 2018, but the Buccaneers have plenty to spend. Licht hasn't been shy in the past.\n2016 record: 8-8\nWhy they're here: An avalanche of injuries mixed with some dysfunction reversed the fortunes of a team that won 16 of 21 games between the start of 2015 and Week 5 of the 2016 season. The franchise appears to have transitioned at quarterback, out of necessity, from Teddy Bridgewater to Sam Bradford. But no matter who plays, the Vikings have what is likely a multiyear rebuilding project at offensive line. Bradford isn't the type of quarterback who can thrive consistently without protection.\nWhat could change: An overhaul of the offensive coaching staff, led by new coordinator Pat Shurmur, should better marry the team's personnel scheme, and the Vikings remain strong from a personnel standpoint on defense. But there are still a ton of unanswered questions. Whether or not tailback Adrian Peterson returns, the Vikings must find another featured runner. It's possible they'll need as many as four new starting offensive linemen. Also, Minnesota won't have a first-round pick to jump-start the process, as it gave it up to acquire Bradford last summer.\n2016 record: 8-8\nWhy they're here: Years of failing to build infrastructure around quarterback Andrew Luck have caught up in consecutive 8-8 finishes despite playing in the weak AFC South. That failure cost general manager Ryan Grigson his job, but coach Chuck Pagano appears set to return for at least one more season. Colts quarterbacks were pressured on 34.6 percent of their dropbacks, tied for second most in the NFL this season. It takes a while to overhaul an offensive line, and Luck already is approaching his 28th birthday.\nWhat could change: New general manager Chris Ballard has a strong reputation as an evaluator, which provides optimism that he can accelerate the process of rebuilding the Colts' line and finding Luck more playmakers. Ballard should have about $50 million in cap space to work with, and he'll need to spend some of it on defense, particularly on the edge and in the secondary.\n2016 record: 9-7\nWhy they're here: It's a bit surprising to see them this low, but most observers probably don't favor the long-term success of a run-based offense in this era. The Titans rode that philosophy to their second winning season in eight years, finishing with the NFL's third-most rushing yards (2,187), including 1,287 from DeMarco Murray. But the real impetus for the Titans' surge was the improvement of quarterback Marcus Mariota. Beginning with Week 4, Mariota recorded the NFL's fifth-best QBR (75.3), throwing for 22 touchdowns and five interceptions in that span.\nWhat could change: In reality, the Titans are poised to go places in 2017. They hold picks Nos. 5 and 18 in the upcoming draft, in part because of their decision to trade down from No. 1 in 2016, and they can focus on collecting more playmakers for Mariota. They are projected to have more cap space, about $70 million, than all but two NFL teams.\n2016 record: 10-6\nWhy they're here: Frankly, they're a little low for a team that won nine of its final 11 games to clinch a wild-card playoff berth with a youngish quarterback, a powerhouse tailback ( Jay Ajayi) and a promising first-year coach. But it was the Dolphins' first winning season, let alone playoff berth, in eight years, and perhaps it takes more than that to generate believers. Quarterback Ryan Tannehill will spend much of the offseason rehabilitating a knee injury, a concern for his continued development under coach Adam Gase. Miami's defense, which allowed 382.6 yards per game -- fourth most in the NFL -- must adjust under new coordinator Matt Burke.\nWhat could change: A draft focus on defense would be smart for Miami's outlook. Although the Dolphins are relatively strong up front, led by defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh, they could use multiple second-level playmakers at linebacker. The Dolphins might also consider moving guard Laremy Tunsil, the team's No. 1 overall pick in 2016, to his natural left tackle position.\n2016 record: 6-9-1\nWhy they're here: A streak of five consecutive winning seasons and playoff appearances ended with a thud in 2016. The Bengals' defense, once filled with playmakers, managed 20 takeaways, tied for 19th in the NFL. The future of their secondary is uncertain, given Adam Jones' recent arrest and the pending free agency of cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick. Plus,?longtime left tackle Andrew Whitworth is due to become a free agent. The Bengals are very much a team in transition. To what? That remains unclear.\nWhat could change: Re-signing Kirkpatrick and Whitworth would seem wise, at least for the short term. The Bengals are projected to have more than $47 million in cap space. It also could be argued that they didn't fall as far as they appeared to do. The Bengals lost six games by one score, a problem that could be minimized as they move from place-kicker Mike Nugent to Randy Bullock. Perhaps coach Marvin Lewis, who is seeking a contract extension, will use this offseason as a reset.\n2016 record: 7-9\nWhy they're here: There is high optimism for quarterback Carson Wentz, but his rookie season demonstrated the large learning curve he brought with him to the NFL. He finished the season ranked 26th in QBR (52.8) but displayed all the tools necessary to develop into a much better player. It's fair to question whether the Eagles have surrounded him with enough of an offense, however, to ensure that happens. Without many playmakers and with a receiving corps that had the NFL's sixth-highest drop percentage (5.1), the Eagles averaged just 5 yards per play (29th in the NFL) in 2016.\nWhat could change: The Eagles are poised to make a jump if Wentz continues his development and the Eagles collect more explosive players. Even after surrendering four draft picks to acquire Wentz last season, they have the No. 14 or No. 15 overall pick after trading Bradford to the Vikings. (They'll participate in a coin toss with the Colts at the scouting combine.) This team's priorities should be clear.\n2016 record: 7-9\nWhy they're here: The Saints have been stuck in neutral for most of the past five years. They've finished 7-9 in four of those seasons as the window closes on the Drew Brees era. Although Brees is still playing at a high level -- he ranked fifth in QBR at 72.0 -- the team around him hasn't made much progress. The Saints have never won fewer than seven games with Brees, and he won't let them crash. But until there is reason to be optimistic about the Saints' defense, it will be difficult to expect more than middling results. Since the start of the 2012 season, New Orleans has allowed an average of 26.4 points per game -- third worst in the NFL over that span.\nWhat could change: Defensive coordinator Dennis Allen will return with a mostly new staff. Perhaps that will help the Saints regain an edge. What they really need to do is hit on a pass-rusher or two in the draft. The Saints managed a sack on 4.8 percent of opposing dropbacks last season, sixth worst in the NFL. Improving that statistic might be their quickest path to a playoff return.\n2016 record: 5-11\nWhy they're here: Consecutive last-place AFC West finishes, a coaching change and franchise relocation all add up to a fair amount of pessimism for 2017. The Chargers have a lot working against them before they take their first offseason snap. Their offensive line has been in shambles for years, and their defense is in need of work after allowing an average of 25.7 points per game the past two years -- fifth highest in the NFL.\nWhat could change: Defensive end Joey Bosa could blossom into an every-down game-wrecker in the mold of J.J. Watt after an entire offseason and training camp to refine his skills. New coach Anthony Lynn snagged Gus Bradley as his defensive coordinator, a good hire who could help the Chargers improve defensively in a hurry. If the Chargers can find a playmaking safety in the draft, their defense could at least hold its own in 2017.\n2016 record: 7-9\nWhy they're here: The Bills have moved on to their eighth coach since they last made a playoff appearance in 1999. Sean McDermott has a defensive background -- much like Rex Ryan, Dick Jauron, Gregg Williams and Wade Phillips before him -- but what the Bills really need to focus on is their offense. Quarterback Tyrod Taylor has shown some promise, but the front-office decision to bench him in Week 17 suggests the team will commence yet another offseason search for a quarterback. The cycle continues in Buffalo.\nWhat could change: The Bills have some coaching strength on defense, including McDermott and coordinator Leslie Frazier, and they have the foundation of a strong unit. Under Ryan, the Bills ranked 13th in the NFL in opposing QBR the past two seasons (59.6). If 2016 rookies Shaq Lawson and Reggie Ragland can get healthy, the defense could be an early strength. The Bills' spot at No. 10 in the 2017 draft probably precludes the drafting of a quarterback who can help immediately, but it is high enough to gain immediate help in some fashion.\n2016 record: 3-13\nWhy they're here: Nine consecutive non-winning seasons bottomed out with a 2016 record that tied for the second worst in franchise history. Quarterback Blake Bortles took a step backward in his third season, finishing with the NFL's third-lowest QBR (49.2) and completion percentage (58.9) and forcing an end to coach Gus Bradley's tenure. If new coach Doug Marrone and vice president of football operations Tom Coughlin remain committed to Bortles, as they appear to be, you won't see much public confidence in the Jaguars' chances to improve in 2017.\nWhat could change: The Jaguars have some nice pieces on defense that could coalesce in a different coaching environment. If Coughlin's tough love filters onto the field, a group that includes defensive linemen Dante Fowler Jr., Malik Jackson and Yannick Ngakoue -- along with cornerback Jalen Ramsey -- could prosper. The Jaguars also have the No. 4 overall pick and, barring a trade, will have five top-five picks on their roster when training camp opens.\n2016 record: 4-12\nWhy they're here: After extending their streak of consecutive non-winning seasons to 13, the Rams aren't getting any benefit of the doubt. Their young quarterback, Jared Goff, had the NFL's lowest QBR among all quarterbacks who started at least four games. (The Rams were 0-7 in his starts.) They hired a 31-year-old head coach, Sean McVay, whose bright offensive mind is likely to be mitigated by inexperience in his first season. What's more, the Rams don't have a first-round draft choice, thanks to the 2016 trade to acquire Goff, to help upgrade an anemic offense that ranked last in the NFL -- and it wasn't close -- in scoring 13.6 points per game.\nWhat could change: There is high optimism around the league that McVay will eventually connect with and elevate Goff. Perhaps that could come earlier than expected, and while he's at it, maybe McVay can figure out how to reverse tailback Todd Gurley's disappointing second season. Acquiring one or two legitimate playmakers -- the Rams are projected to have more than $40 million in cap space -- could make a big difference. McVay also made an excellent first hire in defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, who will have a fair bit of talent to work with, including the NFL's best defensive tackle in Aaron Donald.\n2016 record: 3-13\nWhy they're here: Hired with an expectation to repeat the fixes he has executed elsewhere, coach John Fox has instead stumbled to a worse record (.281 win percentage) than predecessor Marc Trestman (.406). Fox's usually sound defense has been terrible, allowing the eighth-most points in the NFL the past two seasons, and he was unable to coax stability from quarterback Jay Cutler. (In fact, Fox appeared to favor journeyman Brian Hoyer last season.) The Bears finished 2016 with the NFL's fourth-lowest Total QBR (45.7) and appear poised to start over at the position in 2017.\nWhat could change: Rookie running back Jordan Howard is a bright spot, having amassed the NFL's second-highest total of rushing yards (1,313), and he could take the pressure off a new\/young quarterback in 2017. The Bears also could get a boost from the presumed return of multiple high-end players who suffered injuries in 2016, from offensive linemen Kyle Long and Hroniss Grasu to receiver Kevin White to cornerback Kyle Fuller.\n2016 record: 5-11\nWhy they're here: The Jets had four quarterbacks on their roster last season, and it's quite possible that none of them has a future with the team. Ryan Fitzpatrick and Geno Smith are pending free agents. Bryce Petty was awful (19.4 QBR) in a four-game audition.? Christian Hackenberg received so little practice time that it's difficult to know anything about him in an NFL context. The Jets found that they weren't nearly as close to competing as they thought they were after a 10-6 season in 2015. It's going to be tough to do much about that this offseason. The Jets are projected to be more than $8 million over the 2017 salary-cap limit, the worst projected situation in the league.\nWhat could change: They should be able to find a blue-chip player with the No. 6 overall pick in the draft. Who knows? The Jets wouldn't be the first team to pull a decent starting quarterback from nowhere. (They did so just two years ago with Fitzpatrick.) They could upgrade their draft assets or possibly get a good player in return if they trade defensive lineman Sheldon Richardson.\n2016 record: 2-14\nWhy they're here: If it weren't for the Browns, the 49ers would have absorbed a national focus as perhaps the NFL's weakest franchise. They've lost 19 of their past 23 games and will undergo their third coaching transition in as many years, the first team to do that in 40 years. The 49ers don't have a single quarterback under contract for 2017, and years of disjointed drafts have left them with one of the NFL's most barren rosters. The 49ers were one of two teams without a single Pro Bowl player in 2016, and in ESPN Insider's most recent roster rankings, they ranked No. 32. General manager John Lynch is an interesting but entirely unpredictable hire.\nWhat could change: Presumptive coach Kyle Shanahan has proved that he can adapt his offense to different styles of players, having utilized a read-option with Robert Griffin III?in Washington and a version of the West Coast scheme with Matt Ryan in Atlanta. That bodes well for the 2017 49ers' offense, regardless of who is on the field. The defense has some building blocks, including linemen Arik Armstead and DeForest Buckner, and could establish some footing with a few draft hits or free-agent signings. The 49ers are projected to have more than $70 million in salary-cap space.\n2016 record: 1-15\nWhy they're here: The worst team of the decade (.259 win percentage since 2010) dispatched most of its best players and predictably produced the NFL's worst team in 2016. That's a lot of \"worsts.\" The Browns bottomed out without addressing their long-term need at quarterback and still have glaring personnel weaknesses at most every position, none worse than offensive line. Their top playmaker, receiver Terrelle Pryor Sr., is a pending free agent.\nWhat could change: The Browns own four spots in the first two rounds of the 2017 draft, including the No. 1 and No. 12 picks, and could inject life into their quarterback job in a hurry. Everything about a full rebuild flows from there. The recent re-signing of linebacker Jamie Collins, meanwhile, offers hope that the Browns will put to use the enormous amount of salary-cap space they're projected to have: nearly $100 million."}

It would come with a pair of oven mitts for handling all the hot takes.\nHalf of the town seems to be saying this is worse than Watergate and the beginning of the end of Robert Mueller. The other half sounds like they are witnessing the installation of a junta.\nBut you know enough by now to understand that it\u2019s neither of those things, not by a long shot. Let\u2019s do figure out what it actually is, though. First, you should read it here if you haven\u2019t already.\nBut here are some relevant revelations, regardless of which narrative to which you subscribe.\nFirst, we have confirmation that the dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele was used in obtaining surveillance warrants for former Trump staffer Carter Page. This is significant since this a longstanding accusation of the foes of the Mueller investigation.\nThey argue that since Steele and his handlers at the investigation firm Fusion GPS were paid by Trump\u2019s political opponents, Steele\u2019s work shouldn\u2019t be allowed to be used against the Trump campaign. There\u2019s no substantiation of the claim that it was the sole reason for the warrants, but it was in there.\nSecond, we know the names of the Justice Department officials who sought warrants against Page, including some of the greatest villains in the defense\u2019s narrative. Former FBI Director turned Twitter troll James Comey, the recently ousted Andrew McCabe and Resistance hero, Sally Yates. But also Trump appointees Dana Boente and Rod Rosenstein.\nThough we have a pretty good idea of what Trump thinks about his current deputy attorney general, Rosenstein, at least Boente seems to still be in good graces, having just been named as general counsel for the FBI, a huge gig aimed right at the heart of overhauling the agency.\nThird, we have corroboration of prior reporting by our Fox News colleagues about how the wife of a since-demoted Justice Department official acted as the conduit for Steele\u2019s dossier. She worked for the research firm that employed Steele and passed it on to her husband and the agency.\nFourth, we also now know that the FBI cut ties with Steele when he confirmed to a friendly reporter his involvement with the investigation in the fall of 2016.\nWhile the memo makes other smaller-bore allegations, including against McCabe for his testimony about the dossier, these four data points are offered in support of the central claim from Nunes & Co.: That the agency wrongfully, unethically and perhaps illegally withheld the true provenance of their information in seeking the warrant.\nThat\u2019s a huge claim that suggests not just Obama-era corruption at the Justice Department, but ongoing crookedness.\nAnd if the origin of dossier was withheld from the FISA court, then warrant would have been granted in error, perhaps denying the proceeds of those warrants. That certainly seems to be the argument of the president\u2019s eldest son, himself a subject of the investigation, is making.\nIn short, the memo reads as if it was written by a criminal defense lawyer who was looking to impeach witnesses are exclude evidence for a potential trial or indictment.\nAnd it might just work.\nThe secret strength of the memo \u2013 and the benign explanation for the FBI\u2019s objection to its disclosure \u2013 is that it makes allegations that the agency cannot answer because of security rules.\nWhen the agency went nuclear over the release, it seems to have been hinting at the fact that in order to answer the charges leveled by Nunes and the Trumps, the agency would have to reveal even more of its work and show even more of its hand on the Trump investigation.\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan says the memo is not about the work of the special counsel, but it really is. Presumably that\u2019s what the foreign policy hawks on the Washington Post\u2019s editorial board were getting at in their harsh indictment of Ryan today.\nRyan, though, also said he believed that the Democratic counter-memo should also be revealed. And we suspect that all of the committees of jurisdiction in the House and Senate will be disgorging enormous volumes of information in the following weeks.\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy buttressed Ryan\u2019s assurances with his own statement today: \u201cAs I have said repeatedly, I also remain 100 percent confident in Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The contents of this memo do not - in any way - discredit his investigation.\u201d\nBut will it be enough to save Rosenstein, Sessions and Mueller?\nThe memo certainly ratchets up the pressure on Mueller. If the special counsel wasn\u2019t hearing Trump\u2019s footsteps loudly enough before, this memo should sound like Clydesdales at a full gallop.\nBut even if the allegations stick, the memo frames powerful taking points for the president\u2019s defenders as the investigation reaches its terminal phase. Even if its bunkum, it\u2019s still good messaging for MAGA Nation.\nAs Kevin Williamson acidly argues today, most of Trump\u2019s supporters, even in Congress, are no longer troubled by untruths of either omission or commission. In Williamson\u2019s explanation, even if the memo was just a stunt aimed at protecting Trump, many in the GOP wouldn\u2019t even care.\nThe reductive reasoning: If the other side is crooked, a little crookedness in one\u2019s own defense is permissible. It\u2019s basically the moral case for plot of \u201cLethal Weapon.\u201d The bad guys are so bad and the system is so corrupt, sometimes you just have to throw an Afrikaner or two out of a skyscraper window.\nOne other big takeaway: This is as close to a majority report as we are likely to ever get from the House Intelligence Committee. There will be a return volley from the Democrats at some point, somehow, some way, but this is really the end for the investigation in the House.\nPage, the subject of these warrants, has presumably long ago ceased to be of interest to investigators either in Congress or at the DOJ. This is an after-action report, not a real-time update.\nBrace yourselves. There will be lots and lots of dumping and lawyerly spinning from all sides as Mueller approaches and reaches the finish line. Treat it all with healthy skepticism and do what you can to reserve judgement until we see the results.\nTHE RULEBOOK: THE GOOD AND THE BAD\n\u201cThe cries of the nation and the importunities of their representatives have, upon various occasions, dragged their monarchs into war, or continued them in it, contrary to their inclinations, and sometimes contrary to the real interests of the State.\u201d \u2013 Alexander Hamilton,Federalist No. 6\nTIME OUT: LET\u2019S GET READY TO RUMBLE!!\nDon\u2019t be like these people. At least know enough to talk intelligently about the Super Bowl.New Yorker: \u201cOn Monday, when the New England Patriots arrived in Minnesota for Super Bowl LII, Bill Belichick, the head coach, descended the stairs of the team\u2019s plane wearing a black fedora. \u2026 The sports media, always eager for imagery, pounced. But after reporters asked Belichick about the uncharacteristic accessory he explained that the hat had belonged to his late father, Steve, who coached and scouted in college football for forty years. This was classic Belichick, offering a prosaic explanation for a decision that others wanted to invest with meaning or mystery. \u2026 As Belichick and [Tom Brady] have prepared for their eighth Super Bowl together, the press has struggled to find something new to say about the two men\u2014hence all the attention on Belichick\u2019s hat. The consensus seems to be that the outcome of the game against the Philadelphia Eagles won\u2019t really affect the so-called \u2018legacies\u2019 of either Belichick or Brady\u2026\u201d\nFlag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with\nyour tips, comments or questions.\nSCOREBOARD\nTrump job performance\nAverage approval: 40.2 percent\nAverage disapproval: 55 percent\nNet Score: -14.8 points\nChange from one week ago: up 1 point\n[Average includes: Monmouth University: 44% approve - 48% disapprove; Gallup: 38% approve - 58% disapprove; Fox News: 45% approve - 53% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 36% approve - 58% disapprove; ABC News\/WaPo: 38% approve - 58% disapprove.]\nControl of House\nRepublican average: 40.8 percent\nDemocratic average: 48.4 percent\nAdvantage: Democrats plus 7.6 points\nChange from one week ago: Democratic advantage down 0.8 points\n[Average includes: Monmouth University: 47% Dems - 45% GOP; Fox News: 44% Dems - 38% GOP; Quinnipiac University: 51% Dems - 38% GOP; ABC News\/WaPo: 51% Dems - 39% GOP; CNN: 49% Dems - 44% GOP.]\nGOP STILL FAR FROM CONSENSUS ON IMMIGRATION DEAL\nRoll Call: \u201cImmigration negotiations are moving so slowly that congressional leaders haven\u2019t even agreed on which policy areas must be addressed as part of a deal \u2014 a fissure that exists even within the Republican Party. The White House and many House Republicans say that at a bare minimum, four pillars need to be addressed in any bill: border security, protections for \u2018Dreamers\u2019 who will lose their legal status with the end of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, family-sponsored visas and the Diversity Visa lottery program. But House Democrats and some senators of both parties say the only realistic path to a bipartisan deal is a narrowed focus on DACA, which is all Democrats really want, and border security, Republicans\u2019 top priority. \u2018My own view is if we can solve DACA and border security, that may be the best we can hope for,\u2019 Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Thune told reporters here Thursday.\u201d\nMeanwhile Trump says if Dems don\u2019t deal, he\u2019ll walk - WSJ: \u201c\u2026many involved in the debate said the chances of a deal appear to be fading. \u2018We\u2019ll either have something that\u2019s fair and equitable and good and secure, or we\u2019re going to have nothing at all,\u2019 Mr. [Donald Trump] told Republican lawmakers at a retreat at the Greenbrier resort here. On Capitol Hill, there was no sign of a breakthrough in the talks a week before the Senate was scheduled to begin debate. Mr. Trump used his State of the Union speech this week to cast many unauthorized immigrants as dangerous criminals. And people in both parties predicted the other side would suffer the greater political consequences if there is no deal, a dynamic that makes compromise less likely.\u201d\nRyan tries to bring welfare reform back into consideration - Politico: \u201cSenate Republicans last December panned Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s pitch to overhaul entitlements. But the Wisconsin Republican is back at it again, repackaging his proposals in hopes of gaining traction on welfare reform. During a GOP retreat here in Appalachia, Ryan urged congressional Republicans to tackle \u2018workforce development.\u2019 He messaged the somewhat amorphous phrase as a matter of \u2018helping people\u2019 \u2014 not a budget-cutting excursive. But at least a half-dozen Republicans told POLITICO that Ryan's proposal could include work requirements for welfare beneficiaries, which could repel senators. Indeed, at least two Senate Republicans said Thursday that they liked the idea in theory \u2014 but weren\u2019t sure the upper chamber would ever take it up.\u201d\nAnd what about the budget? - Roll Call: \u201cRep. Steve Womack, Budget chairman for less than a month, is considering skipping a budget resolution \u2014 thinking time would be better spent changing the budget process. \u2018If I can read the tea leaves on what\u2019s coming from the Senate, that doing a budget resolution that will be meaningful, that we can get House and Senate together on, is very problematic right now,\u2019 the Arkansas Republican said at a Thursday press conference here, where GOP lawmakers were having their annual retreat. \u2026 The annual budget process calls for the president to submit a budget request to Congress and the chambers to use that to come up with their own budget blueprint. But the budget resolutions \u2014 nonbinding overviews of fiscal goals \u2014 that have come out of the House and Senate Budget committees in recent years have seen delayed floor action or none at all, or have been used as conduits for the reconciliation process to pass partisan legislation without the threat of a Senate filibuster.\u201d\nTax bill begins to deliver change, starting with bigger paychecks - AP: \u201cThe contentious tax overhaul is beginning to deliver a change that many will welcome \u2014 bigger paychecks. Workers are starting to see more take-home pay as employers implement the new withholding guidelines from the IRS, which dictate how much employers withhold from pay for federal taxes. Those whose checks have remained the same shouldn\u2019t fret \u2014 employers have until Feb. 15 to make the changes. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has estimated that the new rules will mean more take-home pay for about 90 percent of American workers.\u201d\nREPORT: MCCONNELL READIES REPLACEMENT FOR COCHRAN\nWaPo: \u201cSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has asked the governor of Mississippi to consider appointing himself to the Senate if ailing Republican Sen. Thad Cochran resigns from office, according to two people familiar with the conversations. The idea, which McConnell (R-Ky.) discussed directly with GOP Gov. Phil Bryant this week, would give Republicans a formidable candidate in advance of a possible special election in the state later this fall. President Trump, a supporter of Bryant, backs the plan, according to a person familiar with the situation, though there are several other options that McConnell and Trump have discussed if Bryant declines. Like others interviewed for this article, the person spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private talks.\u201d\nRomney will make a Senate race announcement in two weeks - Salt Lake Tribune: \u201cThe former Massachusetts governor and 2012 Republican presidential nominee said Thursday that he\u2019ll announce on Feb. 15 whether he\u2019ll run for the Senate seat that Sen.Orrin Hatch is vacating. All indications are that he\u2019s in. \u2018Looking forward to making an announcement on February 15th about the Utah Senate race,\u2019 [Mitt Romney] tweeted Thursday afternoon. If Romney weren\u2019t going to run, he\u2019s not likely to tout an announcement two weeks ahead. And rarely do potential candidates hint at a candidacy if the end result is to say \u2018no thanks.\u2019 Friends and supporters of Romney say they want to let him make the formal declaration.\u201d\nWith no formal race announcement, Scott\u2019s fundraising shows Senate race in sight -Politico: \u201cIn the clearest sign he\u2019s ready to challenge Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, Florida Gov. Rick Scott has raised more than $1.1 million for a super PAC he recently revived and stocked it with top consultants from his previous campaigns. Privately, he\u2019s talked up his good polling numbers, according to several supporters who have spoken to Scott recently. A Scott bid would complicate Democratic hopes of winning back the Senate next year \u2014 of the 10 Democrats up for reelection in states carried by President Donald Trump, Nelson has been considered one of the most vulnerable.\u201d\nDNC fudged how much it spent on Alabama special - McClatchy: \u201cIn the immediate aftermath of Doug Jones\u2019 shock victory in the Alabama Senate race, the Democratic National Committee tried to take no small amount of credit. Indeed, it took $1 million worth of credit. The truth is more complicated. After Jones defeated Republican and accused pedophile Roy Moore, the DNC said it had quietly spent $1 million constructing a voter-outreach effort for the Democrat, including an extensive campaign of text messages, phone calls, and door-knockers. Now, faced with documentation that questions the claim, DNC officials say the committee spent only $250,000 of its own money on the race, cash that funded more than two dozen staffers on the ground in the state who, among other things, conducted extensive outreach to African-American voters. The rest \u2013 nearly three-quarters of the total funds originally claimed \u2013 was not a direct injection of DNC money but instead cash the DNC raised on behalf of Jones through email solicitations.\u201d\nThe House districts that matter for a Dem takeover in 2018 - Center for Politics: \u201cIn sketching out a potential path to a bare Democratic House majority of 218 seats out of 435, we found that in all likelihood the Democrats will need to win similar numbers of Republican-held seats won by Hillary Clinton as well as by Donald Trump in the last presidential election. Clinton-won districts are not enough on their own. It is hard to construct a Democratic majority without the party netting several seats from California, and Democrats also likely need to win at least multiple seats apiece in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, where a new district map may be in the offing. The growing number of Republican-held open seats may allow the Democrats to net a third or more of the seats they need to win the House from districts that don\u2019t have an incumbent. But as we\u2019ve previously said, the majority of Democratic gains will have to come from beating incumbents, unless considerably more Republican incumbents retire from vulnerable seats.\u201d\nDems looking strong in key SoCal House races - LAT: \u201cDemocrats have a few problems to sweat over in this year\u2019s midterm elections: winnowing their vast fields of candidates and navigating California\u2019s top-two primary system, to name a couple. But in Orange County, a key battleground as they attempt to take back the House, money doesn\u2019t seem to be one of them. Incumbents in all four Orange County districts held by Republicans raised less money than some of their challengers in the last quarter of 2017. The reports cover fundraising through Dec. 31, before Reps. Ed Royce of Fullerton and Darrell Issa of Vista announced they were bowing out. Their seats are two of the likeliest to flip to Democrats in November.\u201d\nContinetti: \u2018The Back to the Future Democrats\u2019 - Free Beacon: \u201cThe fate of working-class people in the country\u2019s interior is a defining domestic issue. For the Democrats to win nationally, they must stanch their losses among this key voting bloc, just as Clinton\u2019s husband and Barack Obama did. \u2026 [Trump] has framed these issues in ways that leave the Democrats in the cold, and oh by the way he\u2019s taken family leave away from them too. He\u2019s for tight labor markets within the original free trade zone, the United States, and all the Democrats have left is virtue signaling and grievance mongering. Maybe that\u2019s why Nancy Pelosi looked so unhappy Tuesday.\u201d\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\nPoll: 70 percent want Trump to talk to Mueller - The Hill\nTrump holds meeting with NoKo defectors to send message to Kim Jong Un - WaPo\nRead this: What happens when one successful school district goes all in cultural reeducation - Weekly Standard\nWhat would Litmas Day be without The Mooch? - Vanity Fair\nDNC hires former Kerry campaign manager Cahill as interim CEO - Politico\nAUDIBLE: SO WE\u2019LL PUT YOU DOWN AS \u2018DECLINED TO COMMENT\u2019\n\u201cPlease print out my statement, roll it into a little ball, and shove it up your tight liberal a-- Greg.

I was at Dr. King\u2019s Detroit March in 1963, actively following in the steps of other Yankees who had become aware of the tragedy of segregation in our nation. It was de facto (and not spoken of) where I grew up, de jure where these young men took a stand for justice. It was great because time and again, protesters stood by their values, leaving police \u2018unable to take action due to the lack of provocation\u2019. Those determined to maintain inequality were repeatedly exposed for who they were by assault, murder, bombing and assassination. The young men at the lunch counter were models for all of us, not just then, but today.\u201d \u2013 Don McGaffey, Redford, Mich.\n[Ed. note: Thanks for writing in, Mr. McGaffey. I was born at the end of the great tumult that stretched from 1963 to the mid-1970s so I do not have firsthand experience. But I know from living in that era\u2019s aftermath the astonishing degree of disruption you and your peers lived through. I also know that the actions of those young men and women at the Greensboro Woolworth\u2019s were not broadly popular in the moment. There had been for a century white northerners very sympathetic to the cause of black southerners kept in a legal state of sub-citizenship. But those same sympathetic northerners tended to be unhappy when the actions of those victimized by Jim Crow threatened to become too disruptive. The following eight years would prove many of those concerns correct. No one who watched Detroit burn in the aftermath of Martin Luther King\u2019s assassination could say otherwise. But that\u2019s the thing about loving humanity. If you believe in human freedom as the only morally acceptable objective for a government to pursue, then disruption and disquiet becomes a necessary price for its pursuit. The miracle of the Civil Rights Movement is that we navigated it as a culture as well as we did. The question for new generations is whether we can fully recognize what happened, but somehow not be possessed by the past.]\nShare your color commentary: Email us at\nHALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM and please make sure to include your name and hometown.\nIS THAT HEALTH CLASS OR ECONOMICS?\nAustin American-Statesman: \u201cA student at Noel Grisham Middle School in Round Rock is in hot water after ordering a stripper to come to the school on Thursday.

So, I wouldn\u2019t say the property market is crashing because there is still a willing buyer for a willing price tag,\u201d Geh who represents the Malaysian chapter of the International Real Estate Federation told Malay Mail Online.\nGeh likened the situation to the English folklore Robin Hood, noting that the rich would not like the current situation while the \u201cpoor\u201d would be happy being at the receiving end.\nProperty agents here told Malay Mail Online that luxury home or commercial unit owners were willing to shave between 20 to 30 per cent off property prices to seal a deal.\nThis is supported by data from National Property Information Centre (NAPIC), which showed a general decline in transactions within the luxury home segment.\nFrom the second quarter to the third quarter of 2016, total transactions dropped from 2,014 to 1,826 \u2014 a 9.3 per cent decline.\nThe same was seen with high-end commercial properties that fell 10 per cent in the same period.\nWhen contacted, property consultancy firm Knight Frank managing director Sarkunan Subramaniam pointed out that 2017 is a good year to buy property.\n\u201cThe market now has seriously bottomed out and we anticipate the market to recover by the end of this year. Hence we believe this year would be the best year to buy property,\u201d he said.\nBased on a second half property market report for 2016, Sarkunan said there were still launches and previews of luxury condominiums and thus concurred with Geh on the \u201cwilling buyer, willing seller\u201d scenario.\nStatistics by NAPIC revealed that Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Johor were among the states that have been hit the hardest in the luxury property market segment.\nIn Johor, Iskandar Regional Development Authority (IRDA) noted that the housing market was highly segmented from the low-end to the uxurious.\n\u201cThere may be a slowdown in demand for the high end landed segment but, the supply is also not as superfluous as that of serviced apartments,\u201d IRDA said in a statement responding to Malay Mail Online.\nIt said demand for affordable and low-cost properties were not met in the southern part of the Peninsular.\n\u201cEven now, there is a dearth of housing in the price bracket of RM150,000 to RM450,000 which the majority (about 50 per cent) of the population can afford,\u201d it said.\nAccording to data from NAPIC on residential homes in the city valued at over RM1 million, unsold units increased by over nine per cent from the first quarter of 2014 to the same period a year later.\nCumulatively, this is equivalent to RM158 million worth of surplus units in the luxury home segment, based on figures from the first quarter comparison alone. Figures for subsequent quarters are not yet available."}
{"id":"fbc46d20-3329-42a9-8547-b5fbcd9914f7","text":"A child plays in Santiago, Chile. Ricardo Moraes\/Reuters\nA billion kids are now growing up in urban areas. But not all cities are planned with their needs in mind.\nThere\u2019s a device called the Mosquito that emits an annoying sound at a very high frequency\u2014so high that only young people can hear it. It\u2019s marketed by its manufacturers as a means of discouraging kids from loitering in streets and other public spaces. (Shopkeepers have blasted Barry Manilow, to similar effect.) The UK\u2019s first children\u2019s commissioner, Sir Al Aynsley-Green, called it \u201can ultrasonic weapon designed to stop kids gathering,\u201d and cited its use as proof that the nation\u2019s attitude toward its youngest residents was fundamentally wrong. \u201cThis country is one of the most child unfriendly countries in the world,\u201d he said in 2010. What if, instead of devising ways to deter kids from using public space, cities were built to encourage it? That\u2019s a question that city officials, planners, and NGOs are thinking about. Designing cities with young people in mind\u2014particularly outdoor spaces that encourage safe movement and social interaction\u2014stands to be an issue of growing concern globally. By 2050 around 70 percent of people will be urbanites, and the majority of them will be under 18. Today, over a billion children are growing up in cities. Not only will better design help these children thrive and become healthier, more successful adults, but planning for children, with their more limited range and unhurried pace, means simultaneously planning for other vulnerable groups, such as the disabled and the elderly. And the well-being of children can have a way of uniting policymakers who disagree on most everything else.\nBut the fate of urban kids\u2014and their role in shaping city life\u2014can be a fraught topic. In hyper-expensive U.S. cities like San Francisco, which has seen its share of child residents plummet to 13 percent, prosperity has resulted in a relative absence of children in the city, which in turn has made it \u201ca little bit more of a colder or harder place,\u201d as CityLab\u2019s Richard Florida told The New York Times last year. In cities struggling with crime and poverty, on the other hand, youths can often be seen as more of a threat: See, for example, how the issue of youth violence plays out in Baltimore, where elected leaders frequently invoke the specter of juvenile criminality. Amy Levner, a vice president at KaBOOM!, the U.S. nonprofit that works to provide community-designed play spaces for children living in poverty, said the narrative of child-friendly cities has intensified in the past year, and a recent report on the subject from London-based design firm Arup has furthered the conversation. \u201cThe fact that the work came out of a major, multinational firm is exciting,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just coming from academics or policymakers, so it\u2019s reaching a different, broader audience.\u201d So what does designing a city around kids mean? The Arup report\u2019s authors are clear that it\u2019s not just about building more playgrounds, however important such spaces are and will continue to be. The report focuses on two main aspects of design: everyday freedoms and children\u2019s infrastructure.\nEveryday freedoms refer to children\u2019s ability to travel safely on foot or bike and without an adult in their neighborhood\u2014to school, to a rec center, to a park. The \u201cpopsicle test,\u201d in which a child can walk from their home to a store, buy a popsicle, and return home before it melts, is one way to measure this ability. Children\u2019s infrastructure means the network of spaces and streets that can make a city child-friendly and encourage these everyday freedoms. \u201cWhen we create big parks and the big museum in the middle of a city, only certain kids use it, but if we build smaller and more locally, all neighborhoods benefit.\u201d Strategies for how to ensure such child-friendly design focus on walkability and decreasing the dominance of the automobile. The authors recommend interventions like wider sidewalks and protected cycle lanes and footbridges, and point to examples such as Barcelona\u2019s \u201csuperblocks\u201d\u2014square sections of the city where cars are only permitted on perimeter roads, leaving large chunks of space free for pedestrians and cyclists. The report also advocates for more parks, such as Bicentennial Children\u2019s Park in Santiago, Chile, which spans the city and provides a continuous, green walkway and play space through neighborhoods rich and poor. \u201cWild spaces,\u201d where children can play in nature, are also touted. Rotterdam, for instance, offers a forested area in one of its city parks where children can make dens, fires, and rafts\u2014and even camp out overnight.\nOther recommended interventions include bus and tram stops that invite creative play, such as a pilot bus stop in Singapore that features a swing and a rack of books for perusal. The report offers a myriad of other strategies, from planting community gardens to creating infrastructure that anticipates climate change, like stormwater parks that can be used in both flooded and dry conditions. One consistent theme, says Arup: The most effective interventions are implemented at the hyperlocal level. Think front yards and neighborhoods. \u201cOn average,\u201d the authors write, \u201c[spaces in front of homes] make up at least 25 percent of a city\u2019s space and have the greatest potential to encourage everyday freedoms and social interaction.\u201d Focusing on the very local also means that more children can access the interventions. Splashy downtown megaprojects are typically less meaningful amenities for urban families. \u201cWhen we create big parks and the big museum in the middle of a city, only certain kids use it,\u201d said Michael Feigelson, executive director of the Bernard van Leer Foundation, which develops and shares knowledge about early childhood development. \u201cBut if we build smaller and more locally, all neighborhoods benefit.\u201d\nSeveral cities, including Buffalo, New York, and El Paso, Texas, are investing heavily in building children\u2019s museums. These may be appealing draws for tourists, but Levner sees the focus on such expensive downtown development as something of a cautionary tale. \u201cThese solutions are often implemented in places with a lot of political will and funding,\u201d she said. \u201cCities focus on creating a wonderful downtown spaces, but they are often only for people who can afford them, leaving many kids and families behind.\u201d Arup\u2019s report looks mainly at the kid-friendliness of cities in the developed world; child-friendly design can be even harder to accomplish in lower-income countries, where urbanization is occurring very rapidly and in an unplanned manner. \u201cPeople often think of urbanization in the developing world as very dense, with slums and the like, but low-rise sprawl is even more of a problem,\u201d said Jens Aerts, an urban planning expert at UNICEF. \u201cCities in sub-Saharan Africa, for example, are often less compact, and it\u2019s harder to adjust these urban environments to be more child responsive.\u201d The report recommends that children and families be included in urban planning processes, and Aerts noted that this is particularly critical in lower-income countries. \u201cIt\u2019s about creating community life and interaction,\u201d he said. \u201cThis means policies like defining shared spaces for children and families and regulating land use, infrastructure standards, and decision making so that\u2019s possible.\u201d \u201cIf you do everything in the report but you don\u2019t have enough housing and support services, your success will be limited.\u201d Is the plan put forth by Arup enough? Brent Toderian, former chief planner of Vancouver and advocate for making downtowns conducive to family life, has one criticism: a lack of attention given to housing and services. While any smart addition to the narrative of designing for families is positive, he said, the report\u2019s focus on the public realm skips over the need for housing that fits families at many price points, and essential supports such as daycare and schools. \u201cIf you do everything in the report but you don\u2019t have enough housing and support services, your success will be limited,\u201d he said. \u201cGood strategies address all three elements.\u201d While Jerome Frost of Arup agrees that housing and services are a necessity, he countered that first investing in the public realm means ultimately investing in the larger vision Toderian describes. The initial investment, he said, \u201ccreates value that can be captured and recycled to help fund the affordable housing and public services that underpin successful urban childhoods.\u201d\nThere\u2019s another reason why the value of good public space for children\u2019s health and well-being should not be underestimated, according to Feigelson. It\u2019s easier, and cheaper, to fix. \u201cWhen you can\u2019t change housing stock easily, having green spaces nearby, for instance, where families can get out and socialize really does make a big difference,\u201d he says. \u201cChanging bigger ticket items can take a long time and a lot of politics. Beginning with activities that are a bit easier, less expensive, and visible can be a great way to start the debate. City leaders need to feel like they can get things done.\u201d\nFunding from the Annie E. Casey Foundation was provided to support our project \"The Kids\u2019 Zone.\""}

Fifth St. in San Jose Japantown.\nObjects are often said to be \u201cmute\u201d witnesses to history. In this slide presentation, Nancy Ukai will explore some of the stories that she discovered in her research on objects in the Eaton Collection of Japanese American camp artifacts.\nThe items, which include barrack nameplates, furniture, paintings, photographs and carvings, were separated from the community for more than 70 years after they were collected by crafts scholar Allen H. Eaton in 1945 as the camps were closing. Eaton wanted to mount an exhibition but never did, and the objects, which were handed down to his daughter and then to a contractor\u2019s family, came on the market for the first time in 2015.\nAfter a nationwide protest by Japanese Americans, including JAMsj, who criticized private profiting off works that represented suffering and injustice, the auction was cancelled. The collection was later acquired by the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles.\nThe date of this lecture marks the day before the 75th anniversary of the signing of Executive Order 9066 on Feb. 19, 1942, as well as the 65th anniversary of the publication of Eaton\u2019s book, \u201cBeauty Behind Barbed Wire: The Arts of the Japanese in Our War Relocation Camps.\u201d\nUkai is a writer and researcher based in Berkeley. After graduating from UC Santa Cruz, she lived in Japan for 14 years, working as a Fulbright English fellow, a weaving apprentice at a Buddhist temple, and as a journalist for Newsweek and the Asahi newspaper in Tokyo.\nFree with admission to the museum (non-members, $5; students with valid ID and seniors over age 65, $3; JAMsj members and children 5 and under, free).\nSeating is limited.

But on Tuesday, the statuary in London's Parliament Square got a new face: suffragist leader Millicent Fawcett.\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May spoke at the unveiling ceremony and hailed Fawcett as a pioneering feminist who was instrumental in gaining political agency and power for women throughout the country.\n\"I would not be standing here today as prime minister, no female MPs would have taken their seats in Parliament, none of us would have had the rights and protections we now enjoy, were it not for one truly great woman: Dame Millicent Garrett Fawcett,\" May said.\nThe bronze statue depicts Fawcett at age 50 as she was awarded a brooch from the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. In her hands is a placard that reads, \"Courage Calls To Courage Everywhere,\" which was taken from a speech she gave after the death of fellow suffragist Emily Wilding Davison at the 1913 Epsom Derby.\nBorn in 1847, Fawcett dedicated much of her life to fighting for women's rights. She began campaigning for the right to vote at age 19 and quickly became well known as a speaker and organizer. She became president of the NUWSS in 1907 and worked to broaden the group's base to include working-class women. She died in 1929, a year after all women over the age of 21 were granted the right to vote.\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan noted Fawcett's inclusion, or that of any woman in Parliament Square, is long overdue.\n\"When you think of the great people in Parliament Square and when you realize that not one of them is a woman, it sort of begs the question, are we saying there haven't been incredible women in the past? That our country hasn't been built on the back of great women?\" Khan said.\nThe campaign to include a statue of a woman was launched by activist Caroline Criado Perez. She told the BBC that she was jogging past the historic square on International Women's Day in 2016 when she when noticed the absence of any female figures. She started the campaign \"as she sat on a bench outside Buckingham Palace at the end of her run,\" according to the broadcaster.\n\"If [Fawcett] were a man, she'd have hundreds of statues up to her,\" Criado Perez told the BBC. \"She's directly facing Parliament with her placard, so the MPs can see her everyday and think, 'I should probably go and sort that problem out.' \"\nFawcett's monument is also the first in the square to be created by a female artist \u2014 Gillian Wearing, a conceptual artist who won the Turner Prize in 1997.\n\"Other designers and artists just didn't get it like Gillian did,\" Criado Perez told the BBC. \"For me, it was very important [Millicent] was middle aged. I wanted her to be standing there not at all sexualised, but statesmanlike.\"\nCriado-Perez previously campaigned successfully to make Jane Austen the new face of Britain's 10-pound note."}

Our patron was a local McDonald's franchise that rewarded wins with a free hamburger and small soft drink \u2014 a semicovert marketing strategy we happily embraced. In the second year, when our pitcher's accuracy improved dramatically, we had a winning record. That summer, we ate a lot of hamburgers. We'd ride in groups of twos or threes across town to the appointed McDonald's, piling into minivans or, with any luck, Jenny's mom's convertible. We'd slurp Dr. Peppers and devour our just-big-enough burgers. McDonald's was my introduction to onion, minced and reconstituted from its freeze-dried form, and the smallest dab of yellow mustard, its sharpness masked by the sweet-and-tangy ketchup, the perfect-but-always-too-small pickle. After our meal we'd play outside, shaking the Hamburglar jail and squeezing down the too-narrow twisty slides. Our childhoods were waning, but in those long summer evenings, we held on.\nIn college, Wendy's was the fast-food restaurant of choice, given its two-minute proximity to my dorm. It was a step up from McDonald's: thick milkshakes that required a spoon, spicy chicken sandwiches, baked potatoes topped with cheese sauce and broccoli. Taco Bell was strictly drinking food \u2014 grease and sugar to forestall or recoup from a hangover. And then I started to grow up and work in restaurants, and good food abounded: ravioli rolled into thin sheets, filled and pressed each morning; olive tapenade and garlic-laden cream cheese, served with flatbread grilled over fire; paper-thin beef carpaccio, marinated with lemon and capers, garnished with shaved Parmesan. Working in restaurants provided me with both an education about good food and the opportunity to eat it often. For years after I left the industry, I shunned fast food.\nThen I had a son. At 8 months of age, he pulled himself into a standing position and immediately began to cruise the furniture. He was a whirlwind of activity, energy begging to be released. As he grew into a preschooler, expending physical activity was our daily priority. In summers, we'd rotate trips to the park with visits to the zoo and wildlife sanctuary. When it rained, we'd hit Themuseum, but that was a pricey, once- or twice-a-month treat. In my search for indoor alternatives, I discovered an oldie but a goody: McDonald's PlayPlace.\nDespite his border-collie-level energy, my son had little interest in food. He nursed past his second birthday. His main \"solid\" foods were pur\u00e9ed fruit and veggie pouches and PB & J sandwiches on raisin bread. He ate with his hands until age 4, having no motivation to learn to use cutlery \u2014 or to try new foods that required it. Luckily, french fries with ketchup were among his favourite foods. So at McDonald's, I ordered him a Happy Meal, deep-fryer guilt assuaged by the inclusion of a few peeled apple slices. I instructed the boy to eat a single chicken nugget before he could see his toy or play on the indoor jungle gym, a labyrinth of foam mats and plastic tubes. Apparently, this suspense was an excellent motivator to get my son \u2014 who otherwise refused to eat meat \u2014 to try a McNugget. And, it turns out, he liked them.\nAnd so I found myself living a flurry of contradictions. On rainy days, I brought my son to McDonald's, a fast-food restaurant, for exercise and protein. I ordered a salad \u2014 the greens included kale! \u2014 topped with a piece of glorious, crispy battered chicken. Never mind how that chicken was raised or slaughtered or what the fast-food workers were paid \u2014 sorry, Michael Pollan \u2014 my son was eating the meat! He was voluntarily ingesting much-needed protein into his string-bean body. And I was drinking a soda, because I was sleep-deprived with baby No. 2 and desperately needed caffeine, but anyway, it was diet. I couldn't handle the spike to my blood sugar. The baby was hungry, too, so as my older son jumped and climbed and shrieked with delight, deeply entrenched in the pleasures of childhood, I unhooked my bra in McDonald's PlayPlace to feed my new baby the original fast food."}
{"id":"208cac3e-f600-4c89-843d-0493c792e906","text":"Aerosmith was almost one of the few classic-rock era bands to withstand the test of time. After playing together for 46 years, the iconic rock outfit announced their impending breakup and farewell tour in 2016. Despite the split, frontman Steven Tyler shows no intention of giving up his infamous rock 'n' roll lifestyle. The aging rocker performed one of his first solo shows at the BMO Harris Pavilion last night, delighting the crowd with a setlist loaded with Aerosmith hits, a few of his solo tunes and countless covers.\nFrom the back of the venue, a fan would hardly be able to distinguish current Steven Tyler from the gaudy, flamboyant Tyler who fronted Aerosmith in the mid-1970s. Sporting purple glitter bell bottoms and his signature collection of silky scarves, Tyler led his seven-piece band with his timeless glam-rock finesse. His long, wavy hair followed him as he bounced around the stage.\nThough his voice is noticeably more weathered than some of his peers, Tyler was able to hit the high notes and hold the long notes with ease. A quick Google search will reveal that Tyler is 70 years old, but after watching last night\u2019s set, one would never suspect that Tyler could order off the senior citizen\u2019s menu. His stage presence was magnetic; it was hard not to stare as he groped the mic stand and hurled a used harmonica into the crowd.\nHe began his set breezing through Aerosmith\u2019s \u201cSweet Emotion,\u201d an entirely appropriate song made legendary by Richard Linklater\u2019s sweaty summer flick Dazed and Confused. He quickly transitioned into a second Aerosmith hit, \u201cCryin.\u201d The crowd was immediately transfixed, dancing in their plastic chairs while trying not to spill their drinks. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that I am an alcoholic\u2026 in recovery,\u201d Tyler quipped. \u201cBut, the first beer I ever drank was a Miller, so it\u2019s all your fault!\u201d\nLike many of their classic rock contemporaries, Aerosmith\u2019s collection of greatest hits is massive. During the second half of his set, Tyler performed \u201cJaded\u201d and \u201cDream On,\u201d the latter inducing a massive audience sing-along. He certainly isn\u2019t famous for subtlety, and his over-the-top demeanor hasn\u2019t aged a day since the band\u2019s 1972 debut. Tyler slipped only two of his solo tracks into his set, both of which were well-received by the audience. Both songs were performed with a heavy dollop of soul, and it\u2019s clear that Tyler\u2019s solo work draws inspiration from the same bluesy rock that has influenced Aerosmith from the very beginning.\nThe lone fault in Tyler\u2019s set was the hefty amount of cover songs. He managed to slip multiple Beatles covers into the set, and he closed the show with a blistering rendition of Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201cWhole Lotta Love.\u201d He performed every cover with his soulful swagger, but it\u2019s safe to say Tyler has plenty of tried-and-true Aerosmith songs in his back pocket that would please his fans much more. During some points in the set, Tyler and company felt like a very skilled church festival cover band. If Aerosmith diehards were expecting to hear a few of the band\u2019s deeper cuts, they were likely disappointed."}

It said Russia must be persuaded it would face \"unacceptably dire costs\" if it were to threaten even limited nuclear attack in Europe.\nThe sweeping review of U.S. nuclear policy does not call for any net increase in strategic nuclear weapons, a position that stands in contrast to a tweet President Donald Trump sent shortly before he took office, that the U.S. \"must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.\" In his State of the Union address Tuesday, he made no mention of expansion, though he said the arsenal must deter acts of aggression.\nA 74-page report summarizing the review's findings calls North Korea a \"clear and grave threat\" to the U.S. and its allies. It asserts that any North Korean nuclear attack against the U.S. or its allies will result in \"the end of that regime.\"\nIt also cast China as a potential nuclear adversary, saying the U.S. arsenal is tailored to \"prevent Beijing from mistakenly concluding\" that it could gain advantage by using its nuclear weapons in Asia, or that \"any use of nuclear weapons, however limited, is acceptable.\"\nThe Pentagon-led review of the U.S. nuclear arsenal and the policies that govern it was ordered by Trump a year ago. In a written statement, Trump said U.S. strategy is designed to make use of nuclear weapons less likely. In an apparent reference to the threat of catastrophic cyberattack, he said the U.S. aims to strengthen deterrence of major attacks against the U.S. and its allies, including those that \"may not come in the form of nuclear weapons.\"\nOfficially known as a nuclear posture review, and customarily done at the outset of a new administration, the report drew blistering criticism from arms control groups.\n\"President Trump is embarking on a reckless path - one that will reduce U.S. security both now and in the longer term,\" said Lisbeth Gronlund, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. She said the administration is blurring the line between nuclear and conventional war-fighting.\nThe Trump administration concluded that the U.S. should largely follow its predecessor's blueprint for modernizing the nuclear arsenal. It also endorsed adhering to existing arms control agreements, including the New START treaty that limits the United States and Russia each to 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads on a maximum of 700 deployed launchers.\nThe treaty, negotiated under President Barack Obama, entered into force on Feb. 5, 2011, and its weapons limits must be met by Monday. The U.S. says it has been in compliance with the limits since August and it expects the Russians to comply by Monday's deadline. As of Sept. 1, the last date for which official figures are available, Russia was below the launcher limit but slightly above the warhead limit, at 1,561."}

It\u2019s fair to wonder how long these statistics will remain, though, because although advocates are working very hard to eliminate the death penalty, it\u2019s feared the practice could return with a vengeance this year.\nThese activists at anti-death penalty rallies in Little Rock know death row best \u2014 they were exonerated https:\/\/t.co\/y44YmRT3Ep #Daily360 pic.twitter.com\/ULHGSutPPP\u2013 The New York Times (@nytimes) April 17, 2017\nAccording to a newly released Amnesty International report, only 20 people were put to death in the United States last year, which is the lowest figure since 1991. The U.S. is just one of 23 countries that endorse capital punishment.\nJames Clark is a death penalty expert for Amnesty International. He believes the reason there\u2019s been a general reduction in executions is because jurisdictions are realizing that capital punishment does not deter crime, plus it\u2019s a costly exercise.\n\u201cProsecutors are charging the death penalty less, jurors are less inclined to hand down death sentences and that trend to stop using the death penalty trickles upward to result in a downward trend in executions we\u2019re seeing.\u201d\nIn 2016, death sentences were contained to just five states in the U.S. \u2013 Florida, Alabama, Texas, Missouri, and Georgia. Two years prior, there were seven states using the death penalty.\n\u201cEven states that are able to execute are doing it far less frequently. Those few states that are pursuing executions are becoming an isolated minority.\u201d\nBig Pharma has become a leader in the fight against the death penalty https:\/\/t.co\/gA4yPauxjy pic.twitter.com\/M2cv9AAMHz\u2013 Business Insider (@businessinsider) April 17, 2017\nThen there\u2019s the question about lethal injection protocols. Pending litigation has slowed down and even halted executions in some states because inmates on death row claim that the sedative known as Midazolam is not effective: Midazolam is used prior to injecting more painful lethal drugs.\nIn fact, Midazolam has been blamed for botched executions in Oklahoma, Ohio, and Arizona. Both the possibility of lawsuits and the lack of availability of the drug have stymied states waiting to execute prisoners.\nIt was just last month that a federal judge ruled that lethal injections in Ohio could be too painful to be considered constitutional. This ruling prompted Governor John Kasich to postpone the executions of eight inmates.\nActivists now fear that when these legal challenges have been resolved, executions could increase this year. It\u2019s understood that there are currently almost 3,000 inmates on death row in the United States.\nArkansas is just one of 12 states that hasn\u2019t been deterred by the pending legal challenges; they\u2019re planning to execute seven people over a 10-day period very soon because one of their lethal injection drugs is due to expire by the end of April.\nJames Clark is the senior death penalty campaigner for Amnesty International U.S.A., and he says that some states have put executions on hold or instigate \u201clegal challenges that have prevented executions\u201d after several executions resulted in \u201cagony and pain.\u201d\n\u201cBut not every state has slowed down as a result of that. We\u2019re calling on authorities to look rationally at the justice system rather than whipping up a sense of fear.\u201d\nAnti-death penalty crusader Sister Helen Prejean to speak at #DePaul Wednesday as part of panel discussion.https:\/\/t.co\/dHHsq1LLbk pic.twitter.com\/pcHPdDW7g9\u2013 DePaul Newsroom (@DePaulNewsroom) April 17, 2017\nThe Huffington Post reported that plans to execute seven inmates over a 10-day period in Arkansas has drawn a lot of international attention.\nIn 2016, 1,032 people were executed in 23 countries, while the year before, a record 1,623 people were executed. According to Amnesty International, however, figures from countries like North Korea and China, and countries in conflict like Syria, are unreliable at best.\nIn its full report, Amnesty International said that China leads the world in the use of the death penalty, followed by Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq. Next, comes Pakistan, Egypt, then the United States. Even though the Chinese government considers executions to be a state secret, Amnesty International believes that China easily surpasses the combined total of all countries.\nWilliam Nee is Amnesty International\u2019s researcher in China.\n\u201cThe United Nations and other bodies have asked every country that executes around the world for information on the number of people given death sentences and executed, but China has not cooperated with these bodies for 40 years.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the United States has long been criticized by international legal groups and human rights activists for its use of the death penalty. In fact, it\u2019s the only country in the Americas that currently carries out executions, and along with Japan, it\u2019s the only member of the G8 to do so.\nLethal injection is the primary execution method in the US\u2019 31 death penalty states.

One hundred and forty-one countries are either no longer using it or have completely abolished executions.\nAmnesty claims that in most countries where people were executed or sentenced to death, capital punishment was imposed following proceedings that did not comply with international fair trial standards. Their research claims that in countries like China, Bahrain, Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and North Korea, some death sentences have been based solely on confessions that could well have been extracted by means of torture.\nAt least 7 states are considering barring the death penalty for severely mentally ill: https:\/\/t.co\/Tj75IowBRI via @RebeccaBeitsch pic.twitter.com\/E38r8b3G0r\u2013 Pew States (@PewStates) April 17, 2017\nKate Allen is the United Kingdom\u2019s director of Amnesty International, and she believes that the U.K. has toned down its long-standing foreign policy of urging other countries to abolish the death penalty, and that \u201ctrade and security issues\u201d are getting in the way of larger human rights issues, in particular regarding countries like Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.\n\u201cWhen, shockingly, Bahrain executed three men after deeply unfair trials recently, the Foreign Secretary could muster only the mildest of rebukes. At its best the U.K. does some very important work in encouraging countries to end capital punishment, but with death sentences running at record levels around the world, now is not the time to go quiet on the issue. If governments in Beijing, Manama, Islamabad, and Riyadh see there\u2019s very little public outrage over executions, then they\u2019re going to think they\u2019ve got a green light to carry on killing.\u201d\nHowever, a spokesperson for the Foreign Office said that the United Kingdom opposes the death penalty.\n\u201cWe condemn and do not support it under any circumstances. The global trajectory is towards abolition and the UK supports this trend. We will continue to back the UN global moratorium on the use of the death penalty as a first step towards ultimate abolition.\u201d\n[Featured Image by View Apart\/Shutterstock]"}

This week we'll focus exclusively on the Bills' overtime victory over the Colts in snow-blanketed Orchard Park. That's right, the Blizzard Bowl.\nThe CBS telecast opens with the crew in the booth sending it down to Steve Tasker, who deserves a lifetime achievement Emmy for his four hours of sideline work during what was a legit lake-effect snowstorm. Later in the telecast, play-by-play man Andrew Catalon threw it to Tasker with a, \"Steve, you still alive down there?\" I don't even think he was kidding.\nThis is pretty much as bad as it got. This is when it most felt like the Colts' white helmet and uniform combo would present a serious disadvantage for the Bills, who opted for their garish \"Color Rush\" garb. The Colts even did a little trolling about it on Twitter. It's a given that people at New Era Field were experiencing something wild and unique. But those watching on television were also treated to a surreal experience.\nThe Bills will clinch top Ebenezer Scrooge status this holiday season if they don't throw their groundscrew a bone after this. This was an unprecedented circumstance acording to people who have been close to Bills football for decades. The storm hit one hour before kickoff and continued through four quarters and a full overtime period. The work for the crew simply never stopped.\nHere's another surreal report from Tasker late in the third quarter: \"The shovel crew is gassed. They're trying to run back and forth across the field, trying to keep the field clear between plays. They're taking a knee and sucking down Gatorade and everything. I've never seen anything like this game. It's taken a toll on everybody.\"\nSeriously, if there isn't at least a beefy Best Buy gift card in the crew's stockings, the football gods should double down on this Bills postseason drought.\nThis is a funny punt. I don't imagine Rigoberto Sanchez got too much experience in these conditions at the University of Hawaii.\n\"The wide receiver did not get two feet in bounds before disappearing in a bottomless snow drift until April. The ruling on the field is an incomplete pass. Third down.\"\nYou know who was loving this game? NFL Films, that's who. Sabol Inc. gonna eat. The above replay comes from CBS, who did fine work given the challenges (true story: the telestrator froze). That view of Kelvin Benjamin's touchdown is quite beautiful, isn't it? Another reminder of how much high-definition television has enhanced the sports fan experience. You kids today don't even appreciate it! (loses balance on porch, falls, breaks hip)\nIf you've ever wondered what 5-foot-9, 250-pound fullback Mike Tolbert looks like when attempting to cut and accelerate in a foot of snow, wonder no more!\n\"We kept saying it was like we were on a beach [in the sand],\" Bills wide receiver Deonte Thompson said after the game. \"The snow was so high so every time we stepped in it we would sink so it was tough to run a route. This is going to be something I tell my grandkids about. ... It was a crazy day today.\"\nLet's also give it up for Bills fans, who seemed to make the most of a difficult in-stadium fan experience. Something tells me Bills Mafia was a little more lubricated than usual by the second half. While we're here, how the hell did these fans get home after the game? Are they still there? Is this a National Guard situation? SAVE THE BILLS MAFIA!\nThere were three touchdowns scored in this game, which amounts to something of a Christmas miracle. The first two led to extra-point attempts, which gave us the high comedy of a bunch of men in tights furiously attempting to clear a landing spot for the poor kicker before the play clock expired. It was like a Double Dare challenge.\nBefore Adam Vinatieri attempted his game-tying PAT late in regulation, an angry official chased away a Colts water boy (man?) who was getting footsy with turf. No helping allowed, water man!\nVinatieri, of course, is the most famous snow kicker in NFL history, thanks to his heroics in the 2001 AFC Divisional Playoffs (yes, better known as The Tuck Game, Raiders fans). The old man added to his legacy with this funky extra point that hooked inside the upright like a Randy Johnson slider.\nVinatieri missed both his field-goal attempts, including one in the final seconds of the fourth quarter that would've given Indianapolis the win. We'll give him a pass, but someone still has to tell his kids Santa won't make it this year:\nKicking in a blizzard could cost Adam Vinatieri a $500,000 incentive. He needs to hit at least 90% of his field goals this season to get it. He was at 95.7% before the Buffalo game. He's now at 88%. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Joel Corry (@corryjoel) December 11, 2017\nLeSean McCoy's touchdown run in overtime set off a joyful celebration in a game that, lest we forget, had huge implications for a Buffalo team attempting to qualify for the postseason for the first time in 18 years. Even if they miss out again, no one can take away their conquest in Blizzard Bowl I.\nNever before has a snow angel been this well-earned. Flap your wings, my rugged celestial cosplayer. You deserve to fly.\nUntil next week.\nDan runs the End Around section of NFL.com and hosts the award-winning Around The NFL Podcast. Follow him on Twitter if you want."}

(AP) \u2014 After a Florida radio station's general manager told hosts they didn't have to put an obnoxious repeat caller on the air a couple of months ago, the man stood on the sidewalk outside and vented his irritation with the station through a bullhorn.\nCraig Kopp, manager of WMNF-FM in Tampa, said the guy left for a while but reappeared \u2014 the day after a shooting left five Maryland newspaper employees dead.\nNow Kopp's stomach is twisted in knots wondering how to handle the situation.\n\"I walk this fine line all the time between the most precious of things, the First Amendment, and health and safety,\" said Kopp, a broadcast veteran in charge of 70 volunteers who host music, news and heated political talk shows on the listener-supported station.\nThe difficulties journalists face when dealing with threatening behavior from members of the public came into stark relief in Thursday's deadly attack at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis.\nSuspect Jarrod Ramos, 38, has a well-documented history of harassing the paper's staff. He filed a defamation suit against the paper in 2012 that was thrown out as groundless and often railed against them in profanity-laced tweets.\nRamos' ire began with an online harassment and stalking case stemming from contact with a high school classmate in late 2009 or early 2010. The woman eventually went to police, and Ramos pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor harassment charge. The newspaper's story about the case touched off a yearslong tirade from Ramos.\nA barrage of menacing tweets led to an investigation five years ago, but a detective concluded Ramos was no threat, and the paper didn't want to press charges for fear of \"putting a stick in a beehive.\"\nPeople who have been the victims of online discussion of physical violence, doxing (publishing private information) and rape threats aren't surprised the Capital Gazette attack started with online harassment.\nKatie Kausch said she was harassed online as an intern at MTV after writing a story about people who don't believe the Sandy Hook shooting that killed 26 at an elementary school really happened.\nAnonymous people unhappy with the story found Kausch's college grade point average and her little sister's school address and published them online. They wrote vague, menacing statements like \"I hope nothing happens to you... .\"\nKausch said MTV's legal team was helpful to a point, but because the harassers were anonymous and hadn't issued a specific threat against her, there wasn't much she could do.\n\"Legal was an all-female team; everybody had experienced some level of doxing or threats,\" she said, adding that she and her mother decided not to report the harassment to police.\nSarah Kogod, a former director of development for sports website SB Nation who has led workshops on how to deal with online harassment, said the threats are difficult to handle, both for police and the social media networks themselves.\n\"The general rule is that if it's a direct threat, all jurisdictions will take that seriously,\" she said. \"The challenge comes when the communication is vague. It's brushed off as someone being a jerk. In most cases, it is.\"\nShe encourages liberal use of the block function and thinks companies need to deal better with online harassment.\n\"I truly feel that organizations have a responsibility to make sure they can guide their staff through that harassment,\" both online and off, she said.\nIt's something Kopp, the station manager, has considered. Although he's used to sharp online words like ones they remove from the news department's Facebook page, he wonders how to handle the in-person threat of the angry man with the bullhorn. He's putting in new surveillance cameras and people must be buzzed in the front door, something that seems anathema to the station's community-oriented approach.\n\"We've had potlucks with the doors wide open, for the community to come right in to see what radio station looks like. I don't want to stop that,\" he said.\nSeveral weeks ago, the man marched past a receptionist into the on-air studio. By the time police came, the man was back on public property. So far, Kopp has called police twice on the man, but there's been no arrest.\n\"I think some of these people are unstable, and in the current environment, I don't know what could set somebody off in the wrong direction. It's a constant worry, now more than ever before,\" Kopp said."}

Credit: Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) Experiments at ANSTO have provided supporting evidence of unexpected enhancement of water solubility of biomolecules in an aqueous solution of divalent transition-metal cations.\nThe discovery is significant for understanding physical, biological and chemical processes involved in drug design, functions and synthesis of macromolecules, and may even provide clues in the prevention of Alzheimer's disease.\nFundamentally, the findings may potentially change the traditional view of the interactions between biomolecules with metal cations.\nThis research outcome, recently published in Physical Review Letters, is part of an international collaboration between ANSTO's Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering (ACNS) and the research group for interfacial water at Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics (SINAP), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.\nGenerally, in solution with many multivalent transition-metal ions, such as Cu2+, Pt2+, Pd2+, and Co3+, the solubility of aromatic amino acids decreases significantly because most of them will form complex precipitates with the ions, as documented in standard chemistry and biochemistry reference works.\nHowever, considerably increased solubility of tryptophan (Trp) in a CuCl2 aqueous solution has been observed experimentally and predicted theoretically by the research group led by Professor Haiping Fang at SIAP.\nTranslational diffusion co-efficient data as a function of momentum transfer . Credit: Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO)\nThis unusual phenomenon can only be observed under a special condition of high local concentration of Cu2+ at the surface of Trp.\nFundamentally, it is attributed to the strong interaction between Cu2+ and the aromatic ring in Trp, referred to as the cation-pi interaction.\nCo-authors Dr Dehong Yu and Dr Richard Mole carried out measurements using quasi elastic neutron scattering (QENS) on the Pelican instrument at ACNS. The experiment provides direct evidence of the strong cation-pi interaction responsible for the enhanced solubility of Trp in a CuCl2 aqueous solution.\nQENS exploits small energy exchanges between the diffusing particles and scattered neutrons, which is directly related to the diffusive processes taking place in the system. The self-diffusion coefficient of the system can be obtained from the QENS measurement.\nThe significant difference in diffusion coefficients between tryptophan with and without Cu2+ suggested that the tryptophan complex containing Cu2+ moved much more slowly than the tryptophan without Cu2+.\nThis observation supports the theoretical prediction of the enhancement of water affinity due to the presence of Cu2+.\n\"In this experiment we make full use of the QENS capability of the Pelican instrument and the high sensitivity of neutrons to hydrogen atoms to study Trp dynamics under different environments, as the QENS signal from the entire system is dominated by the hydrogen atoms in tryptophan,\" said Yu.\nExplore further: Pelican instrument provides crucial experimental evidence of unusual quantum state\nMore information: Guosheng Shi et al.

It\u2019s not our fault. I\u2019m sure if you asked the fans of the Warriors and the Cavs around the world, whether it\u2019s in the Bay Area or in Cleveland, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re happy with their team performance. The only people I hear saying that are fans from other teams, which is natural. I don\u2019t blame them. But as long as our fan base is happy, that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the first time in NBA, NFL, MLB or NHL history that the same teams are meeting four straight times in the championship round, and intrigue in the teams hasn\u2019t waned yet. The NBA had its most-watched conference finals since 2012, as both teams had to rally from 3-2 deficits to win Game 7s on the road.\nBut if this series quickly becomes as lopsided as some fear \u2014 ABC analyst Jeff Van Gundy said he couldn\u2019t remember a bigger gap between finals teams and said any game the Cavs win is a huge upset \u2014 many of those people who have tuned in the last few years might be looking for something else to watch by the time the series switches to Cleveland.\n\u201cIf James and the Cavaliers win Game 1, you know, the interest is going to skyrocket because they are going to have done what very few \u2014 except for them maybe \u2014 think they can do, which is win at Golden State,\u201d Van Gundy said. \u201cIf they get blown out both games, it doesn\u2019t matter what we say. People aren\u2019t going to be as excited.\u201d\nThe players won\u2019t apologize for showing up again, or worry that it hurts the NBA.\n\u201cI mean, it may not be as suspenseful as a lot of people want it to be or as drama-filled,\u201d Durant said, \u201cbut that\u2019s what you\u2019ve got movies and music for.\u201d\nSome things to watch when the series begins at Oracle Arena:\nBE LIKE MIKE\nIf the Warriors win, it would be their sixth NBA championship and tie them for third on the all-time list with the Chicago Bulls, who won all theirs with Michael Jordan. Then it would be a long way to go from there to catch Boston (18) or the Lakers (17).\nMOVING ON UP\nJames could vault into second place on the NBA Finals\u2019 career lists for points and assists. He has 1,247 points and needs 71 to pass Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1,317) and move behind only Jerry West (1,679). His 339 assists are 61 behind Bob Cousy (400). Magic Johnson had 584.\nSCORING STARS\nWhile matching up on the court, James and Durant could flip-flop on the career post-season scoring list. James currently has a slight edge, with his 28.83 points per game placing him fourth and slightly ahead of Durant, who has averaged 28.75. Durant has been even better in the NBA Finals, with his 32.9 points per game ranking last year\u2019s finals MVP behind only Rick Barry (36.3) and Jordan (33.6) among players who have appeared in at least 10 games.\nDOING IT WITH Defence\nThe much-maligned Cavaliers\u2019 defence has shown up in the post-season, where Cleveland is allowing just 99.9 points per game, second among the 16 teams. The Cavs held Boston under 100 points in four of the final five games of the East finals. More impressively, Golden State kept high-scoring Houston under 100 in five straight games and is right behind Cleveland at 100.3 in the playoffs.\nNEW-LOOK LOGO\nViewers will notice something new on the court during the series. The familiar NBA Finals logo has been replaced and the floor will now be marked with one that reads \u201cThe Finals presented by YouTube TV.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\nFollow Brian Mahoney on Twitter: http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/Briancmahoney\n\u2014\u2014\nMore AP NBA: https:\/\/apnews.com\/tag\/NBAbasketball"}

The products aren\u2019t regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and her concern about customer safety grew when she discovered more than 1,500 ingredients known to cause health problems are banned in Europe but haven\u2019t been eliminated in the U.S.\nDupuis felt the marketing was misleading, there was no transparency, and manufacturing benefited companies rather than consumers. So she began making soap and other products in her kitchen and giving samples to friends and relatives.\n\u201cI wanted to do something good for women that wouldn\u2019t damage their health or the environment,\u201d she said. \u201cThese products are being washed down the drain and are affecting the planet.\u201d\nShe moved back to Amherst in 2010 and decided the following year to market her products to retail stores. She was working as an assistant to Tom Horton of Sustainable Resources, and his wife introduced her to people at Joia Beauty in Northampton, and they sold out of her products in weeks.\nShe continued to sell her product line, and in 2012, with help from fianc\u00e9 (now husband) Graham Immerman, Dupuis launched a campaign and raised more than $7,000 on Indiegogo to donate safe skin-care products to women in need.\nThat same year, Horton introduced her to Paul Silva at Valley Venture Mentors (VVM). In 2015, Olive Natural Beauty won the first VVM Accelerator program for startups in Springfield. She and her team of 10 per-diem workers prepared and packaged 300,000 units of products and generated $250,000 in revenue by the end of that year, and she gave the keynote speech at the 2015 Grinspoon, Garvey & Young Entrepreneurship Conference.\nLast year, Dupuis hired 13 local women to help fulfill orders and was featured multiple times on ipsy, the largest beauty-product sampling program in the world. Since then, 200,000 \u2018ipsters\u2019 have been introduced to her safe skin care, and she has mentored many VVM entrepreneurs seeking help with their startups.\n\u201cI dreamed about having my company become successful, but never thought this would happen,\u201d she told BusinessWest. \u201cIt has been a very humbling experience, and I am not only proud but very grateful to people who have helped me.\u201d\n\u2014Kathleen Mitchell"}
{"id":"63c8c9eb-31cd-4d93-a511-00a738abd7cf","text":"Working from home can be a dream for many. But for some, it can also mean a bigger tax bill.\nScroll for more content...\nIf you live in one state but work remotely for an employer based in another, you risk paying more tax than you would if you lived and worked in the same state. In a few cases, you may even end up double taxed.\nThe good news: You can avoid this fate if your home state has a reciprocal tax agreement with a neighboring state, which establishes that your income would only be taxed by one of the two.\nSuch agreements exist in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New Jersey, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin as well as the District of Columbia.\nOr, absent a reciprocal agreement, those who work from home some of the time may be allowed to split their income tax burden: They pay tax on income earned from home to their resident state, and they pay tax to their employer's state for days they work at the office.\nBut that's not always the case.\nHow you can end up double taxed\nYou risk being double taxed if you live in one state but work for a company based in New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania or Nebraska.\nThese five states apply a so-called convenience vs. necessity test. If they determine that working from home is a matter of convenience for you rather than a necessity for your employer, \"you will owe taxes to those states on the income you earn during your work-from-home days,\" said Cosimo Zavaglia, an associate at the law firm Morgan Lewis.\nRelated: 3 reasons your boss doesn't want you to work from home and why she's wrong\nNew York is toughest in this regard, according to Roxanne Bland, a contributing editor to State Tax Notes.\nFor instance, to contend that working from home is a necessity, you must prove you could not possibly do your work at your employer's office or that your employer requires you to work from home as a condition of employment. You also may need to prove the employer has a business purpose to have an office exactly where you live or that you regularly hold business meetings at your home office and never use it for personal reasons. The list goes on.\n\"Very few telecommuters would meet this standard. Thus, New York's convenience of the employer test will likely result in double taxation of a telecommuter's income,\" Bland wrote in Tax Notes.\nRelated: The business traveler tax threat\nThat's because your resident state may also choose to tax the income generated by your working from home.\nFortunately, many states give you a tax credit for any taxes you pay to another jurisdiction. So effectively you end up only paying income tax to one state when all is said and done, although you still have to file two state tax returns.\nBut not all states are so generous. Connecticut, for instance, only gives residents a credit for taxes paid to another state for income earned in that other state. It won't give you a credit for money you earned working from your living room in Fairfield.\nSo if you telecommute from Connecticut to an employer based in New York you'll end up being double taxed on the portion of your income earned from home.\nCalifornia has different rules. It taxes its residents on all income, regardless of where it's earned. So if you live in California and telecommute to an employer based in New York, you could be double taxed on at least a portion of your income as well.\nWhen you'll simply pay more\nMore common than double taxation is the risk of paying more tax than you otherwise would if you simply lived and worked in the same state.\nIf you telecommute from Florida - which has no state income tax - but work for an employer in a state with an income tax, you'll likely end up paying that on some or all of your income.\nOr if you work for a company in a state with a higher income tax than your home state, you'll end up paying the higher of the two amounts, according to Zavaglia. That's because your home state will only give you a tax credit up to the tax you'd owe if you earned all your income in-state.\nHe added that \"this increase in total taxes is even more of an overall concern now that state and local taxes in excess of $10,000 are no longer deductible at the federal level.\""}

But it seems that for many people it takes a horrifying personal experience to really understand how dangerous it can be. For Cade Huckabay, it took a swollen head for him to realize that protecting your skin from the sun is no joke.\nThrough a series of photos on Twitter, Huckabay showed followers just how unbelievable sun damage can be, when his head swelled up to the point where a touch of his fingertip would leave a dent in it.\n\u201cOne time I shaved my head, got severely sunburned, & swelled up just a little bit,\u201d Huckabay wrote, understating what can be seen in the photos. The amount of swelling is pretty severe, but it\u2019s no surprise, considering it was his head\u2019s first full exposure to the sun.\n\u201cSince it was always covered in hair or a hat, my scalp had basically never seen sunlight before that,\u201d Huckabay tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cNeedless to say, I got it kinda bad.\u201d\nReplies to the tweet have shown a lot of concern about Huckabay\u2019s health post-burn, with many asking if he consulted a doctor. The Texan shared with some followers that Advil and ice \u201cgot the job done,\u201d but further explains that he refrained from a doctor\u2019s visit, since there were no other symptoms.\n\u201cI knew the swelling was just from the burn, and I wasn\u2019t having any other symptoms of something more serious being wrong with me,\u201d he says. \u201cI was perfectly healthy other than my head being a few sizes overgrown.\u201d\nAccording to images shared in response to Huckabay\u2019s tweet, it\u2019s evident from other people\u2019s responses that the incident isn\u2019t the first of its kind.\nLuckily, Huckabay has learned his lesson and seems more serious about protecting his skin, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve learned to wear a hat pretty much every time I do any kind of yard work!\u201d As for his responses to concerned followers, he takes full responsibility for his sunburn, and now warns others to wear sunscreen."}

McDonald, and is more evidence that two former members of the high court were aligned against him, Democrats said Tuesday.\nWithin hours of McDonald\u2019s nomination to be chief justice on January 8, State Sen. Michael A. McLachlan, R-Danbury, sent him a request for specific documents and records from his time on the court.\nIf the letter seemed familiar to McDonald, it might have been because it was nearly identical, word for word, to a letter he had sent to then-Supreme Court Justice Peter T. Zarella in 2006 when Zarella was nominated to be chief justice. McDonald was a state Senator at the time and co-chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n\u201cWe would be happy to meet with you to discuss your nomination and potential questions regarding your plans for the Judicial Branch,\u201d said the April 4, 2006 letter from McDonald and his committee co-chairman, then-Rep. Michael P. Lawlor. \u201cI would be happy to meet with you to discuss your nomination and potential questions regarding your plans for the Judicial Branch,\u201d Sen. McLachlan wrote on January 8.\nBoth letters have nearly identical opening and closing paragraphs and identical requests for material related to the state Criminal Justice Commission, as well as their speeches and seminars.\nDemocrats say it\u2019s more than a coincidence that a letter from McDonald to Zarella, whose nomination to chief justice was unsuccessful, was sent back to McDonald at the start of his confirmation process.\nState Senate President Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, said Tuesday that it\u2019s clear that Republicans, with the aid of Zarella and another former justice, C. Ian McLachlan, assisted in the near-unified Republican opposition to McDonald.\n\u201cIt is also additional evidence that there was a concerted effort among Republicans, from the very beginning, with side support from two former justices,\u201d Looney said. \u201cIt gives more credence to the argument that the decision was made to oppose Andrew McDonald\u2019s nomination, and reasons were developed after the fact to support that decision. It\u2019s word-for-word except one missing paragraph, (on the Rules Committee) but Justice McDonald was not on the Rules Committee.\u201d\nGov. Dannel P. Malloy said the interference of politics in the judicial branch should \u201coffend fair-minded people everywhere.\u201d\n\u201cIt is now undeniable that Senator McLachlan and his Republican colleagues never had any intention of fairly considering Justice Andrew McDonald\u2019s nomination,\u201d Malloy said. \u201cWe need look no further than the completely different treatment they gave this week to another well-qualified nominee.\u201d\nZarella was nominated by Gov. M. Jodi Rell who later withdrew the nomination after then-Chief Justice William J. Sullivan admitted to delaying the release of a controversial decision to possibly assist Zarella\u2019s candidacy.\nThe 2006 letter was released to Hearst Connecticut Media on Tuesday morning by the state Judicial Branch under an open-records request. Both McDonald and Lawlor declined to comment on the letters.\nSenator McLachlan, a real estate agent, said Tuesday his FOIA request \u201cwas intentionally written to mirror the 2006 request.\u201d Republican staff requested the 2006 letter from the Judiciary Committee, he said, using it as \u201ca model\u201d to direct to McDonald on the day of his nomination.\n\u201cThe information sought is customarily and routinely requested as evidenced by the letter written by then Senator McDonald and Representative Lawlor,\u201d McLachlan said of the 2006 request. \u201cAlthough the letters were extremely similar, the responses to each were markedly different, with Peter Zarella providing numerous bankers\u2019 boxes worth of information, and Justice McDonald providing a three ring binder.\u201d\nMcDonald\u2019s candidacy for chief justice was opposed by every Republican in the Senate and the House but one. It failed 19-16 in a Senate vote last month. One Senate Democrat voted against him and another recused herself from voting. Hearst reported on Sunday that emails obtained under the state\u2019s open-records laws indicate that C. Ian McLachlan and Peter T. Zarella, former Supreme Court justices now in senior positions with the firm of McElroy, Deutsch, Mulvaney & Carpenter, received emails related to the nomination from Sen. McLachlan and the legislative lawyer for Senate Republicans.\nIn addition, Ian McLachlan, the senator\u2019s cousin, advised him on the nomination, as he has about other legal issues during his 10 years in the General Assembly and his tenure on the Judicicary Committee.\nThe senator said that while he met with Zarella and his cousin, he did not speak with Zarella about the McDonald nomination. Late Saturday night, Zarella issued a statement via email that said he never contacted legislators about the McDonald candidacy. Ian McLachlan has not returned requests for comment.\nZarella, a former chairman of the West Hartford Republican Town Committee, was named to the high court in 2001 by then-Gov. John G. Rowland, and served with McDonald for three years before leaving the court in 2016. Rowland named Ian McLachlan to the Appellate in 2003 and was elevated to the Supreme Court by Rell in 2009. He retired to 2012, a year before the nomination of McDonald, who still serves on the Supreme Court.\nSuzanne E. Baldasare, a partner in McElroy, Deutsch, Mulvaney & Carpenter\u2019s Fairfield office said the law firm \u201cwas neither aware of, nor involved in, this matter. The Firm has been and remains non-partisan, and does not endorse, or seek to defeat, any candidate for any office.\u201d\nMcDonald sat for a 13-hour Judiciary Committee hearing in February that focused mostly on his legal writings that sparked a charge from supporters that Republicans were politicizing the nomination. On Monday, Justice Richard Robinson\u2019s three-hour hearing \u2014 and confirmation vote \u2014 centered on questions from lawmakers on what his goals might be as chief justice.\nkdixon@ctpost.com Twitter: @KenDixonCT"}

The document also implies that religious\/belief communities may exercise their rights without state registration.\nOne of the key recommendations of the opinion is to refer systematically not only to \u201creligion\u201d, but also to \u201cbelief\u201d, in order to eliminate the differential treatment between \u201creligious\u201d and \u201cbelief organisations\u201d where the latter may not benefit from the same rights and guarantees.\nThe opinion noted that the Holy Armenian Apostolic Church is conferred \u201cthe exceptional mission \u201c by the Constitution and is subject to a special legislation prevailing over the Draft Law in question. The Council of Europe and OSCE\/ODIHR experts recommend ensuring that privileges enjoyed by the Holy Armenian Apostolic Church are objectively justified and are not thus discriminatory.\nThe limitations on the manifestation of freedom of religion or belief should be narrowed down and qualified more strictly. Notably, the reference to \u201cstate security\u201d should be replaced with the term \u201cpublic safety\u201d, or at least this term should be given the narrow interpretation compatible with the European standards.\nThe report was adopted at the Venice Commission\u2019s plenary session on 17 March.\nEnglish \u2013translator\/editor: Tigran Sirekanyan"}

The artworks were to be auctioned this week.\nThe images from CCTV footage showed two males wearing dark clothes, black gloves and bandanas partially covering their faces. Police estimated they were 20-30 years old.\n\"If you recognise any of these men \u2013 even if you suspect it could be someone you know, please get in touch with us,\" Detective Inspector Scott Beard of the Auckland City Police said in a statement.\nAuckland's international airport was on high alert for anybody trying to transport the paintings out of the country, police said. They also informed Interpol, the global police cooperation agency.\nLindauer, who emigrated to New Zealand in the 1870s, is best known for his detailed portraits of Maori chiefs. The stolen art, believed to have been painted in the 1880s, are portraits of Chief Ngatai-Raure and his wife, detailing the Maori practice of facial tattooing.\nThe New Zealand Herald reported that the paintings were valued at NZ$1 million ($700,000) as a pair.\n\"It is one of the most significant art thefts in New Zealand if we look at the value of the works,\" Ngarino Gabriel Ellis, a senior lecturer in Maori art history at the University of Auckland, told Reuters.\nEllis said it was likely the thieves thought they could sell or ransom the paintings, but warned that it would be difficult.\n\"You cannot sell them anywhere globally through an auction house because they are under pressure in terms of due diligence,\" she said. \"Also, ransoming doesn't normally come off because almost always they are nabbed when the money is collected.\"\nNigel Borell, curator of Maori art at the Auckland Art Gallery, said Lindauer's work was very important to New Zealand's history.\n\"Lindauer was probably New Zealand's most prolific portrait painter,\" Borell said. \"The saddest part is the fact that some irreplaceable damage may have occurred during the robbery.\"\n($1 = 1.4284 New Zealand dollars)\n(Reporting and writing by Benjamin Weir, Editing by Darren Schuettler)"}

The conservative National Party ended with 44 per cent of the vote, while the liberal bloc of the Labour Party and the Green Party ended with a combined 43 per cent.\nNegotiations to form the next government will now begin in earnest.\nBoth sides will need to talk with the small New Zealand First party, led by maverick 72-year-old lawmaker Winston Peters. That party finished with 7 per cent of the vote, leaving it holding the balance of power.\nPeters hasn't indicated which of the larger parties he favours. A former National Party lawmaker, Peters has formed coalitions in the past with both National and Labour.\nIn the 120-seat parliament, the votes translate to 56 seats for National, 46 for Labour, nine for New Zealand First and eight for the Green Party. The final vote count gave both Labour and the Green Party one extra seat apiece over their election night tally. Those came at the expense of the National Party, which lost two seats.\nPrime Minister Bill English said voters had clearly favoured National over Labour and he looked forward to engaging with Peters so National could lead a strong and stable government.\nThe National Party has held power for the past nine years.\n\"Not since 1969 has the National Party finished ahead of the Labour opposition at four successive elections, and I want to thank everyone involved in this historic achievement,\" English said in a statement.\nLabour leader Jacinda Ardern said she welcomed the final tally."}

Flynn when he was national security adviser in the first days of the Trump administration about his conversations with the Russian ambassador, current and former officials said on Tuesday.\nThe interview raises the stakes of what so far has been a political scandal that cost Mr. Flynn his job. If he was not entirely honest with the F.B.I., it could expose Mr. Flynn to a felony charge. President Trump asked for Mr. Flynn's resignation on Monday night.\nWhile it is not clear what he said in his F.B.I. interview, Mr. Flynn maintained publicly for more than a week that his conversations with the ambassador were innocuous and did not involve Russian sanctions, something now known to be false.\nShortly after the F.B.I. interview, on Jan. 26, the acting attorney general, Sally Q. Yates, told the White House that Mr. Flynn was vulnerable to Russian blackmail because of inconsistencies between what he had said publicly and what intelligence officials knew to be true.\nAt issue is a conversation during the presidential transition in which Mr. Flynn spoke to the Russian ambassador about sanctions levied against Russia by the Obama administration. The call spurred an investigation by the F.B.I. into whether Mr. Flynn had violated the Logan Act, which prohibits private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments in disputes with the United States.\nOn Wednesday, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said that President Trump was made aware of the situation weeks ago. Mr. Spicer said the White House had reviewed the situation and determined that Mr. Flynn didn't violate any laws during his call with the Russian ambassador.\nMr. Spicer said Mr. Flynn was asked to resign because he had lost the trust of the president and vice president."}

Philipp Gunz \/ MPI EVA LeipzigReuters\nNew discoveries and new dating methods show that in fact many of the bones belong to modern Homo sapiens, and they lived as far back as 300,000 or 350,000 years.\nThe earliest previous Homo sapiens bones date back 195,000 years ago and they\u2019re from clear across the continent, in modern-day Ethiopia.\nTaken together, the findings show modern humans were dispersed across Africa long before anyone ever thought.\n\u201cThere was no Garden of Eden,\u201d Jean-Jacques Hublin, a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany who has been working at the site for decades, told reporters.\nRelated: Mastodon Bone Findings Could Upend Our Understanding of American Pre-History\nInstead, he said, modern humans arose across Africa.\nBack then, the Sahara desert wasn\u2019t such a barrier and people could have crossed north Africa much more easily, Hublin and colleagues argued.\nThe site has been under excavation since the 1960s, but a team recently found a new layer, along with flint tools that had been heated by fire. Pieces of bone and skull from five different people are among the new finds.\nAn almost complete adult mandible discovered at the Jebel Irhoud site in Morocco. Jean-Jacques Hublin \/ MPI EVA via EPA\nWriting in the journal Nature, Hublin and colleagues argue the skulls belong to clearly modern humans, even if the head shape is a little longer and narrower than those of modern people. As with all scientific discoveries, they are throwing out the evidence for debate and discussion. No single story is ever the last word on any issue.\nThe team dated tools and bones to between 300,000 and 350,000 years ago.\nRelated: Early Homo naledi may have buried dead in caves\n\u201cThis evidence makes Jebel Irhoud the oldest and richest African Middle Stone Age hominin site that documents early stages of the Homo sapiens clade,\u201d they wrote.\nAlong with the human remains are bones of gazelles, zebras, wildebeest and other prey animals, as well as leopards and lions.\n\u201cThanks to improvements in dating techniques, particularly in luminescence dating, this layer, from which all the specimens had been excavated, is now revealed to be approximately twice as old as previously thought,\u201d Chris Stringer and Julia Galway-Witham of Britain\u2019s Natural History Museum, who were not involved in the research, wrote in a commentary.\nRelated: Pre-Human Lucy Climbed Trees\n\u201cWe agree with Hublin and colleagues that the Jebel Irhoud fossils now represent the best-dated evidence of an early \u2018pre-modern\u2019 phase in H. sapiens evolution.\u201d\nExcavations at the Jebel Irhoud site in Morocco. Shannon McPheroon \/ MPI EVA Leipzig via Reuters\nIt's not so easy finding ancient human remains. Unless they are preserved somewhere dry \u2014 like the deserts of north and east Africa \u2014 not much is left of anything after tens of thousands of years. Finds are rare and each one must be studied intensively to provide evidence about the many species of pre-humans and early modern humans that populated the world.\nStringer and Galway-Witham also agree that Homo sapiens probably continued to evolve a bit while remaining the same species. Brains grew and changed and intelligence probably did, too, they said.\nIt's the latest astonishing find that rewrites the history of early humans. Earlier this year a team argued they had found evidence that either modern humans or pre-humans were in North America 150,000 years ago."}
{"id":"8224ea91-39f6-4bac-a118-34f99b071f45","text":"The Other Fish has a long lineage in Bethlehem, tracing its roots back to The Dancing Fish on the city\u2019s South Side under owner Lucy Lennon, which operated the Japanese restaurant 2000 to 2007. The restaurant then moved to the north side. Now owned and operated by Matthew Reichard, the neighborhood joint has become a favorite among locals.\nThe menu has some traditional items, like ramen and udon noodle bowls, but gets creative in sushi options, such as the \u201cDrunk on Tuesday Roll,\u201d which features a \u201ccertain well known corn chip,\u201d and options with local flavor, such as Deja Brew dish (spicy tuna sashimi served over thinly sliced avocado) and the Andretti roll (a spicy scallop hand roll).\nThere\u2019s the classic teriyaki beef chicken or salmon if you\u2019re not feeling adventurous, and other filling entrees such as shrimp and vegetable tempura if you\u2019re not into sushi.\nSetting and d\u00e9cor: The decor is no-frills. A bar along the sushi case with seating for eight offers an up-close look at the food being prepared. Situated on the right of the narrow restaurant are three two-seat tables. Only one four-seat table and a bit of outdoor dining accommodates groups. If you like your sushi with a side of punk and rock, music by the likes of Rage Against the Machine, Streetlight Manifesto and Nirvana was playing while we dined.\nAppetizers: On my first visit my wife got the house salad ($4), a pretty straightforward affair of lettuce and carrots topped with house ginger dressing. While the salad was drowning in dressing, it was such a fantastic concoction I couldn\u2019t stop picking at her dish.\nOn my second visit I got takeout and went for the Kamakazi chicken ($8), which was fried with a small amount of batter and a very light spice. Frequent readers of this column know my almost insatiable appetite for spicy food, and this dish left me wanting heat, especially given the name and the warning it was \u201cspicy.\u201d The kicked-up mayo on the side certainly helped.\nEntrees: On my first visit, my wife and I took a tour of the sushi menu, as that was all that was being offered that evening. The Mi Amore roll ($9.50) was chock full of velvety salmon, spicy tuna, and fresh avocado. Her Fox ($8.50) roll was similarly amazing, with cucumber and tempura crunch in lieu of the salmon.\nThe Japanese bagel roll ($8.50), an interesting American bastardization, was my favorite, stuffed with cream cheese and smoked salmon, lending that classic New York deli flavor to a Japanese dish. Even the apple cucumber roll ($6) was excellent, a bright and perfect spring dish that surprised us both.\nOn my second take-out run I got the ramen noodle bowl ($13), and let me just say: wow. The stellar umami-laden miso broth, the classic Ajitsuke Tamago soft-boiled egg, housemade noodles, and spicy (yes!) chili oil left me wanting more. Thin slices of beef, shiitake mushrooms and a load of scallions rounded out the quart and made this a home run.\nService: We ran into a few problems trying to dine at The Other Fish. On one visit it was unexpectedly closed, and on the night of our second visit it was offering only sushi. Nonetheless, when we visited the first time the service was friendly and quick, and my second take-out order was promptly ready at the stated time.\nBottom line: I\u2019d easily recommend The Other Fish. The sushi is great, and there are a lot of inventive options. And the ramen is so on point it I already can\u2019t wait to eat it again. Dinner on one visit for two totaled $34.57. Takeout dinner for one with copious leftovers on a repeat visit totaled $21.28.\nDETAILS\nThe Other Fish\n59 E.

{"id":"8a696072-8e8d-46cc-a631-53fe4ecd0b3b","text":"WE are less than a week away from the solar eclipse on August 21 (Monday) which will be visible to all of North America. The \u201c are less than a week away from the solar eclipse onwhich will be visible to all of North America. The \u201c path of totality \u201d where the total solar eclipse is visible will stretch through 13 states from Oregon to South Carolina. In the centre of that 112-km wide path, the total eclipse will last from 2 minutes to 2 minutes and 40 seconds. Outside of this path, observers will see a partial eclipse.\nBig events also mean big opportunities for scammers and unscrupulous businesses. With a rare event like this, it is important to plan carefully and to trust your instincts. Here are some things to be wary of while you get ready for the eclipse.\nCounterfeit Eclipse Glasses\nTo view the solar eclipse directly without damage to your eyes, you need special solar filter glasses. These are much more powerful than sunglasses. While sunglasses only block about 50% of the sun\u2019s rays, solar filter glasses block more than 99.99%. Unfortunately, many of the solar glasses available online may be counterfeit or do not meet safety specifications. Your best bet is to stick with a brand whose glasses are certified by NASA and the American Astronomical Society (AAS). Here is a list of reputable vendors from AAS\nHere are some additional tips for safe viewing:\nRegular sunglasses, even very dark sunglasses, are not enough.\nWarn children of the danger in viewing the eclipse without protective eyewear.\nDo not look at the uneclipsed or partially eclipsed sun through an unfiltered camera, telescope, binoculars, or other optical device.\nDo not look at the sun through a camera, a telescope, binoculars, or any other optical device while using your eclipse glasses or hand-held solar viewer \u2013 the concentrated solar rays will damage the filter and enter your eye(s), causing serious injury.\nIf the filters on your eclipse glasses are torn, scratched, punctured or coming loose from their cardboard or plastic frames, discard them.\nIf you are unable to get glasses, one way of indirectly observing the eclipse is by using a pinhole projector. NASA has instructions on how to do this, as well as files to print out and use, here\nAccommodation Scams\nIf you are looking for a place to stay during the eclipse, be careful if you are booking through a site like Airbnb, VRBO, or Craigslist. Make sure to correspond within the website or app and not through other means. Always double check that a listing is on the real website and emails are coming from official addresses. Using a credit card offers the best fraud protection. Don\u2019t deal with anyone who asks for payment outside of the platform\u2019s approved options.\nThere have been reports of travelers who booked hotels for the eclipse long in advance (before it was widely publicized) only to see their reservations canceled or moved to hotels far from viewing spots. Some of the original rooms are then offered again at a much higher rate. If you are traveling out of town for the eclipse and have a hotel booked, make sure you double-check your reservations before heading out.\nEvent Scams\nCities across the path of totality are holding eclipse festivals with both free events and VIP viewing parties. Scammers may set up fake events or charge people for access to free public parties. These tips for avoiding summer festival scams can also help you separate real eclipse events from fake ones. NASA has information on many events here\nBus Scams\nTraffic will likely be very heavy on any road between a major city and the eclipse path. A bus might sound like great option, but be careful you don\u2019t make a reservation only to end up without transportation. Make sure you deal directly with a bus or limo company to avoid scammers using a legitimate business as a front . Go to BBB.org to look for accredited businesses and read reviews and complaints before you book.\nThis month\u2019s eclipse may be a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see a rare astronomical event right in your backyard.

The most sweeping of the two compels the campuses to do away with remedial classes taken by thousands of new students each year. The chancellor\u2019s office said it disagrees with the association and plans to have the changes in place this fall.\nThat\u2019s when new students deemed to need remedial classes will have the new classes to choose from. The national association and CSU faculty said that\u2019s not enough time for professors at each campus to come up with a replacement.\n\u201cEssentially [students] are being guinea pigs in an experiment that we are forced to execute and it\u2019s not clear to me what\u2019s being proposed is any better than what we had,\u201d said Cal State Northridge math professor Michael Neubauer.\nHe said the new classes are covering some of the same material covered by the remedial classes but that material hasn\u2019t earned students college credits in the past.

(AP) \u2014 Unveiling a long-awaited plan to combat the national scourge of opioid drug addiction, President Donald Trump called Monday for stiffer penalties for drug traffickers, including embracing a tactic employed by some of the global strongmen he admires: the death penalty.\n\u201cToughness is the thing that they most fear,\u201d Trump said.\nThe president traveled to New Hampshire, a state ravaged by opioids and which is also an early marker for the re-election campaign he has already announced. The president called for broadening awareness about drug addiction while expanding access to proven treatment and recovery efforts, but the backbone of his plan is to toughen the punishment for those caught trafficking highly addictive drugs.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about nice anymore,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis is about winning a very, very tough problem and if we don\u2019t get very tough on these dealers it\u2019s not going to happen folks \u2026 I want to win this battle.\u201d\nThe president formalized what he had long mused about publicly and privately: that if a person in the U.S. can get the death penalty or life in prison for shooting one person, a similar punishment should be given to a drug dealer who potentially kills thousands.\nTrump has long spoken approvingly about countries like Singapore that have fewer issues with drug addiction because they harshly punish their dealers. During a trip to Asia last fall, he did not publicly rebuke Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, who authorized extrajudicial killings of his nation\u2019s drug dealers.\nOutside a local firehouse that Trump visited before the speech, someone compared the leaders with a sign that said: \u201cDonald J. Duterte.\u201d\n\u201cDrug traffickers kill so many thousands of our citizens every year,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s why my Department of Justice will be seeking so many tougher penalties than we\u2019ve ever had and we\u2019ll be focusing on the penalties that I talked about previously for big pushers, the ones that are killing so many people, and that penalty is going to be the death penalty.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cOther countries don\u2019t play games. \u2026 But the ultimate penalty has to be the death penalty.\u201d\nThe Justice Department said the federal death penalty is available for limited drug-related offenses, including violations of the \u201cdrug kingpin\u201d provisions in federal law.\nIt is not clear if the death penalty, even for traffickers whose product causes multiple deaths, would be constitutional. Doug Berman, a law professor at Ohio State University, predicted the issue would be litigated all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.\nJohn Blume, a professor and director of Cornell Law School\u2019s death penalty program, said the Federal Drug Kingpin Act has yielded few \u201ckingpins\u201d or major dealers, mostly ensnaring mid- to low-level minorities involved in the drug trade.\nOpioids, including prescription opioids, heroin and synthetic drugs such as fentanyl, killed more than 42,000 people in the U.S. in 2016, more than any other year on record, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nTrump has declared that fighting the epidemic is a priority for the administration, but critics say the effort has fallen short.\nLast October, the president declared the crisis a national public health emergency, short of the national state of emergency sought by a presidential commission he put together to study the issue.\nTrump called for a nationwide public awareness campaign, which he announced in October, to scare kids away from dabbling in drugs. He announced a new website, www.crisisnextdoor.gov , where members of the public can share stories about the dangers of opioid addiction.\nTrump said the administration will work to cut the number of opioid prescriptions that are filled by one-third within three years.\nThe president also discussed how his policies, including a U.S.-Mexico border wall and punishing \u201csanctuary\u201d cities that refuse to comply with federal immigration authorities, would help reduce the flow of drugs and help end the addiction epidemic.\nMonday was Trump\u2019s first visit as president to New Hampshire, which has long occupied a special place in his political rise. He captured his first Republican presidential primary here in 2016, though he narrowly lost in the general election to Democrat Hillary Clinton.\nTrump drew criticism last year after leaked transcripts of a telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto showed he had described New Hampshire as a \u201cdrug-infested den.\u201d The Washington Post published the transcripts.\nThough the 2020 election is more than 30 months away, early jockeying is already happening in states that play an outsized early role in choosing a party\u2019s nominee. Retiring Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., a persistent Trump critic, visited New Hampshire, which holds the nation\u2019s first presidential primary, last week. He told Republicans someone needs to stop Trump \u2014 and it could be him if no one steps up.\nMeanwhile, the president\u2019s daughter, White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump, spent Monday discussing infrastructure and workplace development in Iowa, which traditionally holds the first presidential nominating caucus.\n___\nSuperville reported from Washington.

According to the Antarctic Heritage Trust, \"it has been documented that Scott took this particular brand of cake with him at that time.\"\nThe Huntley & Palmers fruitcake was wrapped in paper and housed in a tin-plated iron alloy tin, which is showing signs of deterioration. However, the cake itself is \"well-preserved,\" the conservators say.\n\"There was a very, very slight rancid butter smell to it, but other than that, the cake looked and smelled edible!\" the Trust's Programme Manager-Artefacts Lizzie Meek said in a statement. \"There is no doubt that the extreme cold in Antarctica has assisted its preservation.\"\nThe century-old dessert was found with nearly 1,500 other artifacts from two huts at Cape Adare.\nAccording to the Trust, the first buildings on the continent \"were built by Norwegian Carsten Borchgrevink's expedition in 1899 and later used by Captain Scott's party in 1911.\" Meek says the team members were finishing up their work collecting objects when they were surprised to find the old dessert.\nShe adds that even present day explorers love a good fruitcake: \"It's an ideal high-energy food for Antarctic conditions, and is still a favorite item on modern day trips to the ice.\"\nThe cake's sheer density probably helps. As NPR's Maria Godoy has reported, people doing outdoor work in the Antarctic need about 5,000 calories a day \u2014 and more like 6,500 if you're involved in manhauling, which is \"pulling sleds across the ice and snow with their bodies.\"\nMaria writes that there's one clear lesson that Antarctic explorers have learned over the years: \"When life is stripped down to man versus the most brutal elements, bring plenty of snacks.\"\nThis is something Scott's team knew \u2014 in fact, Maria says that \"his party conducted a study that suggested a high-carb, high-fat diet to be optimal for the harsh climes.\"\nBut tragically, explorers on Antarctic expeditions were often hungry. Scott himself starved to death while on the return journey from the South Pole.\nThe objects recovered from Cape Adare \u2014 including a watercolor painting of a Tree Creeper bird by scientist Edward Wilson \u2014 are undergoing conservation treatment and will be returned there, because the huts are deemed an Antarctic Specially Protected Area. That will happen after restoration work is finished on the buildings themselves."}

We may have weedy grass, but we\u2019re busy making the best mead possible.\u201d\nThe Buzz on Honey\nHoney is crucial to mead production because it not only provides sugar for fermentation but adds distinct flavor. \u201cMead\u2019s terroir\u2014it\u2019s sense of place\u2014comes from the honey, which reflects the flowers the bees feed on and the soil that sustains those plants,\u201d John said. At Rohan Meadery they use Texas-produced wildflower honey.\n\u201cThere are a lot of weird imports,\u201d Wendy said.\nFor instance, she said, the Chinese are inoculating their bees with growth hormones to stimulate honey production, and they also export ultra-filtered products, which removes all traces of pollen and the only clues as to the honey\u2019s origin. In some cases, the imported product is not actually honey but a man-made substitute.\n\u201cHoney is too important to what we do to take any chances, so we depend on regional sources we can trust,\u201d Wendy said.\nBlissful Folly Farm is home to only 20 hives that the family tends themselves. They also purchase honey from the Reed family of Montgomery, Texas, who operate BeeWilde Bee & Honey Farm and manage about 3,000 hives. The Rohans use wildflower honey, which is gathered in the fall and is dark with complex flavors, to make their beverages.\n\u201cOur mead will always be small batch because of the honey supply,\u201d John said.\nThe Rohans currently make 14 styles of mead. At any given time, eight are available depending on season and fruit availability. A tasting flight that offers five samples of in-stock meads, wines or ciders is available for $5.

That will inevitably lead to Arsenal fans urging the club to add immediate reinforcements to the squad.\nHowever, January is also a time for forward planning; at that point, the Gunners will be able to enter negotiations to sign foreign-based players on free transfers.\nThat would be a particularly smart strategy for Arsenal. With Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil both able to walk away without the Gunners receiving a fee unless the players agree new deals, Arsene Wenger needs to consider ways to augment his squad without spending too much.\nArsenal have already appointed Sven Mislintat to improve their recruitment team, which suggests they are aware they are entering an important period of squad building. As soon as Mislintat has his feet under the desk, he will be scouring the list of players whose deals expire in 2018 for potential signings.\nLast summer's Bosman acquisition, Sead Kolasinac, already looks like a shrewd move. In this piece, we take a look at four players Arsenal could bring to the club for nothing in the summer of 2018.\nLeon Goretzka\nTF-Images\/Getty Images\nGerman midfielder Leon Goretzka is already being talked about as a prospective Arsenal signing. Earlier in December, Daniel Cutts of The Sun reported that the Gunners are set to beat a number of top European club to the player's signature:\n\"Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger is closing in on a free transfer for Schalke star Leon Goretzka.\n\"The German midfielder is out-of-contract next summer, and wants to leave for a new challenge.\n\"A number of Europe's top clubs have looked at snapping the 22-year-old up, including Manchester United and City.\n\"But the Gunners are confident they have won the race for his signature, in a major coup for Wenger's men.\"\nGoretzka plays for Schalke 04\u2014the same club Kolasinac left last summer. They seem to have as much trouble keeping their stars as the Gunners do.\nCentral midfield isy an area where Arsenal could do with reinforcements. Their first-choice partnership is Aaron Ramsey alongside Granit Xhaka, although there are doubts over whether the Switzerland international is of the requisite calibre to be at the hub of a successful Arsenal side.\nThere also isn't much competition for places. Francis Coquelin and Mohamed Elneny have been exposed as little more than squad players, while Jack Wilshere's fragility means he is unlikely to hold down a first-team place. As for Santi Cazorla, there must now be doubts over whether the Spaniard will play again after his latest injury setback.\nGoretzka would be a terrific addition to Wenger's options. He is a box-to-box midfielder, with his remarkable stamina enabling him to be effective at both ends of the pitch.\nIt's his exploits going forward that he has become best known for. He has a knack of arriving into the box at the perfect time to meet cutbacks from wide areas. Combine that with an impressive long-range shooting ability, and Goretzka offers a real goal threat.\nThere is bound to be plenty of competition for someone as gifted as Goretzka. The player himself has indicated that January will be when his future is decided. Speaking to reporters recently, he said: \"I have to find out for myself what the next step should be. I have to consider a million things. I am a person who is very meticulous in such decisions. I play through all the scenarios. So I need time. There doesn't exist a deadline, but I think we are in the final phase. The final decision will be made in January.\"\nIt's quite rare that the opportunity arises to sign a player who could immediately strengthen your first XI for no transfer fee. Goretzka's potential availability is one such opportunity, and Arsenal simply have to make him a big offer in January.\nKepa Arrizabalaga\nJuan Manuel Serrano Arce\/Getty Images\nBy the end of this season, Petr Cech will be 36. It's essential Arsenal start looking for a long-term replacement for the veteran shot-stopper.\nThat's not likely to be David Ospina. The Colombian's contract expires at the end of this season, and he's likely to take the opportunity to seek first-team football elsewhere. If Wenger were serious about anointing Ospina as Cech's successor, he might well have given him more chances to test himself in the Premier League.\nWenger has never put too much emphasis on the goalkeeping position, muddling through with the likes of Manuel Almunia and Lukasz Fabianski for longer than was appropriate. He can't afford to make a similar mistake again\u2014Arsenal must move for a top young goalkeeper to ensure they are not too reliant on an ageing Cech.\nKepa Arrizabalaga would fit the bill. The 23-year-old is still a relative novice but is already being talked about as the next great Spanish goalkeeper.\nHe has been a regular for Spain's under-21s, and it's surely just a matter of time until he is challenging David De Gea for a place in the senior side.\nTo put his progress in some perspective, while he is the same age as Arsenal prospect Matt Macey, he is already playing regularly in La Liga for Athletic Bilbao. Macey, meanwhile, has only made one start for the Gunners.\nThe biggest issue here is going to be competition. Having been foiled in their moves to sign De Gea, Real Madrid are reportedly hot on Kepa's case. According to Marca, the Spanish champions are prepared to pay the \u00a317 million needed to buy out Kepa's contract in January (h\/t Will Griffee of MailOnline).\nArsenal might not be in such a hurry and are likely to concentrate on persuading the youngster to sign a pre-contract to move in the summer. Interestingly, because Kepa is under 24, he would not arrive at Arsenal or Real for nothing. His fee would be set by a tribunal, but the likelihood is he would still prove to be far cheaper than he would be on the open market.\nArsenal have made a bit of a mess of Cech's succession, allowing Wojciech Szczesny to leave despite Juventus deeming him good enough to replace Gianluigi Buffon. This is a chance for the Gunners to redeem themselves and land one of Europe's brightest prospects.\nBernard\nCARLO HERMANN\/Getty Images\nArsenal were first linked with Brazilian forward Bernard back in July 2013\u2014and the Evening Standard even described them as being \"on the verge\" of finalising a deal for the then-Athletico Mineiro man:\n\"Arsenal are on the verge of finally making their first major signing of the summer as they close in on a club record deal for Brazil international Bernard.\n\"Tottenham, Liverpool, Borussia Dortmund, Shakhtar Donetsk and Porto have also been keen to buy the Atletico Mineiro but Arsenal are in advanced negotiations with Atletico Mineiro over a \u00a321million switch.\n\"Sources in France suggest Bernard has agreed a five-year contract worth \u00a350,000-a-week after tax and will be in London on Friday for a medical.\"\nHowever, it wasn't to be. The deal stalled, and Bernard ended up joining Shakhtar Donetsk. He has enjoyed a relatively successful spell there, winning two Ukrainian Premier League titles, two Ukrainian Cups and two Super Cups. He's also been able to regularly experience UEFA Champions League football.\nBernard is seemingly preparing to test himself in another country. His contract is winding down, and the man with 14 Brazil caps to his name could be looking for a new challenge.\nIt's relatively clear where he would fit into the Arsenal squad; with Ozil and Sanchez potentially off, Wenger will need players capable of operating behind the striker. Bernard has not proved to be a reliable goalscorer, but he is an impressive creator. With that in mind, he would be a more obvious replacement for the German.\nThe big question is whether he has the physical power to cope with Premier League football. Bernard is short of stature and slight of build, and there's every chance he could struggle to acclimatise to English football. However, given there would be no transfer fee needed to secure his services, it might be a gamble worth taking.\nMark Uth\nAMELIE QUERFURTH\/Getty Images\nIn recent years, Arsenal have made a habit of signing players from the Bundesliga. The likes of Xhaka and Kolasinac are likely to be followed by more additions from Germany\u2014especially with Mislintat about to join the club.\nOne potential target is Mark Uth. He's hardly a household name in England, but that hasn't prevented Wenger from taking a punt on players in the past.\nWith Olivier Giroud finding first-team football increasingly difficult to come by, it's possible he will agitate for a move this summer, if not before. If he has ambitions of preserving his place in the France team, he may well have to leave Arsenal.\nThat could leave the Gunners needing a striker to back up Alexandre Lacazette and Danny Welbeck. They have young prospects with potential, like teenager Eddie Nketiah, but Wenger may consider it too soon to promote such a young player to the first-team squad.\nIf Arsenal need a forward to help fill out their squad, Uth could be an option. It's difficult to envisage him being signed as a starter, but he would be a decent rotation option on a free transfer.\nLike Giroud, Uth is something of a late developer. After failing to make the breakthrough at Cologne, he was allowed to join Dutch side Heerenveen. After a loan spell with Heracles, he fought his way into the Heerenveen first team, enjoying a strong 2014\/15 campaign.\nThat prompted Hoffenheim to bring him back to Germany. He has gone on to establish himself as a regular starter and an effective goalscorer. While he is capable of playing from the right flank, he is generally at his best when deployed as a striker.\nUth is 26 and reaching his prime. He is tall at 6'1\" and seems to have the natural athleticism to cope with the Premier League. His best asset is probably his movement\u2014he is quick enough to escape defenders and make the most of his composed left-footed finishing.\nHe has scored 10 goals in 21 appearances across all competitions in 2017\/18. It's a creditable record, especially as seven of those goals have come in the Bundesliga.\nIf reports in Kicker are to be believed (h\/t TalkSport), Tottenham Hotspur are already eyeing a move for Uth at the end of the season. Mislintat might well suggest Wenger adds him to his own shopping list\u2014it's not often such a prolific attacker is available on a free.\nAll contract info via Transfermarkt.\nJames McNicholas is Bleacher Report's lead Arsenal correspondent and follows the club from a London base.

Even if the charge is true, the river, which is the mighty Brahmaputra in India, has enough tributaries with adequate rainfall in catchment areas after coming down to the plains to bring in water to it, he said. \"Even if China diverts water of the river, India does not need to worry,\" Roy Chowdhury said at a symposium 'India-China relations - Ways to resolve contentious issues'. China has denied reports that it is diverting water of to Xinjiang province. Former Security Advisor M K Narayanan, however, took a stronger view of the issue, saying China is trying to start a water war with India. \"China is actively considering a water war over the Brahmaputra,\" he said. Gen Roy Chowdhury blamed the laziness and lack of on the part of the Indian economic sector for lagging behind the Chinese in the industrial and manufacturing front. Referring to the dumping of Chinese goods in India, including even the Lord Ganesha idols, he said it is India's fault not to have pursued a three-pronged approach of \"cooperate, compete and confront.\" \"It is the lazy and greedy Indian economic sector to blame, and not China.\nWe should manufacture good quality products cheaper than China,\" he said. He said 'Made in China' products have overtaken India a long ago and asserted that the Indian manufacturing sector should be strengthened in order to compete with that country. With the Asian economy outgrowing the western economy, focus has shifted from the USA and Europe to Asia and from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean, Narayanan said. \"Rarely has the world seen the rise of two populations at one time and that too in the same region and the results have not been benign; China and India are competing on several counts - political, economic and military,\" Narayanan said. Though the USA is at present their main adversary, the Chinese feel that the real challenge they will face will be from India, the former NSA said at the two-day symposium organised by the Research Centre for Eastern and North Eastern Regional Studies, a Kolkata-based think-tank, that ended yesterday. Former Indian Air Force chief Air Marshal (retd) Arup Raha said, to counter the Chinese threat of befriending our neighbours, India should engage more with these countries by selling them military hardware and also by holding joint military exercises, both bilateral and multi-lateral."}

At least 33 percent of the housing will be permanently affordable and the new development in the neighborhood is expected to generate nearly half a billion dollars in funding for local and regional transit improvements, according to SF Planning.The housing stock in Eastern SoMa is currently 25 percent single-room occupancy hotels, catering to the lowest income residents in the city.According to the ordinance to be considered by the SF Planning Commission later this month, the plan aims to retain SRO hotels, which primarily serve \"elderly, disabled, and single-person households.\"SF Planning's Historic Preservation Committee is slated to consider legislation adopting the Central SoMa plan on Wednesday, March 21st, and the Planning Commission will get a briefing on the legislative package the following day.The Planning Commission cannot take formal action on the plan until the environmental review is complete. The environmental impact report could be certified at the commission's April 12th meeting, according to a notice sent to stakeholders last week.Once the plan is adopted, the city's review of TMG Partner's proposed addition to 505 Brannan can move forward."}

(Photo: TOM BEAUDOIN)\nJust one minute into Friday\u2019s homecoming game at Redford Thurston, it didn\u2019t look like it was going to be the Eagles\u2019 night.\nRedford Union junior running back JuJuan Stokes burst through the line for a 79-yard touchdown run and the Panthers tacked on two more TD runs by Stokes before halftime to go up 21-8.\nBut the Eagles, after playing what coach Bob Snell described as their worst half of the season, turned things around in spectacular fashion. A late flurry capped off a 20-point fourth quarter and sent the game to overtime at 34-34.\nThurston then won the game 42-40 with a TD in the second OT session, collecting the coveted Supervisor\u2019s Cup in the process. The Eagles now are 5-2 (3-2 in the Western Wayne Athletic Conference Red Division) and just one win away from a playoff spot.\n\u201cWe had nowhere to go but up and we had to pull ourselves back up,\u201d said Snell, about the second half transformation. \u201cAnd to their credit they did it. It\u2019s not easy for 16- and 17-year-olds to be shaken like that, and then rise back up and get their composure back and play a great second half.\u201d\nPanthers head coach Miles Tomasaitis lamented the final outcome, but not the fact the RU-Thurston rivalry game is as strong as ever.\n\u201cUnfortunately, somebody had to lose the game and tonight it was us,\u201d said Tomasaitis, whose team fell to 3-4 overall. \u201cBut what a great game, great rivalry. Coach Snell does a great job with the kids. And with all the stupidity that happens in the world we just got a great football game to play against these guys.\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m happy to bring it back because it was missing for a few years. The rivalry actually means something, the game\u2019s competitive and a lot of fun.\u201d\nOn track\nThurston senior halfback Demetrius Dowd was instrumental in the comeback, with touchdown grabs of 13 and eight yards in the final five minutes of the final frame. The more dramatic of the two came on a do-or-die play with 17 seconds remaining.\nOn fourth-and-goal from the 8-yard line, quarterback Keysean Ware (in for starter Zachary Crofford, who had just hobbled off with an apparent leg injury), dumped the ball to Dowd, and it looked like the Panthers had him stopped short of the goal line.\nDowd kept churning his legs and the second effort paid off with the score.\n\u201cWe got a nickname, we\u2019re the Train Boys,\u201d Dowd said. \u201cWe just told each other we were going to keep chugging down the train tracks. I just didn\u2019t want to disappoint my team because I know they really need me.\n\u201cI know I\u2019m a senior, this is my last homecoming game. I didn\u2019t want to let anybody down.\u201d\nThurston still needed to convert the two-point play to send the game to overtime. Junior Leonard Funches took it in with a run. Funches earlier jumpstarted the Eagles\u2019 big fourth quarter when he scored on a 49-yard TD run with 11:41 to go in the fourth.\nThat came just 10 seconds after RU\u2019s Throton Cain scored on an 11-yard carry on the first play of the fourth to make it 28-14.\nBoth teams failed to score in their first crack at an overtime TD (teams start from the 10-yard line). But then Jayshawn Adams swept around left end for the tie-breaker and Funches again scored a two-point conversion.\nCarrying the ball for Redford Thurston is Leonard Funches (20), while RU's Trevon Williams looks to make a stop. (Photo: TOM BEAUDOIN)\nRedford Union responded on Issac Grant\u2019s touchdown run, but the Panthers were unable to make the two-pointer needed to extend the game to a third overtime.\n\u201cWe had the play called, the ball was slippery in the quarterback\u2019s hands,\u201d Tomasaitis said. \u201cAnd he couldn\u2019t get the pitch off or else we\u2019d still be playing right now.\u201d\nFollowing are several other takeaways from the contest:\n\u2022 TOUGH TO STOP: Twice, the Eagles seemed to have Stokes bottled up, and both times he found a way through the maze for touchdown runs. Stokes was a one-man wrecking crew in the first half, with TD runs of 79, 28 and 50 yards.\n\u2022 KEY RESPONSE: Dowd helped get the home crowd into it when he scored on a 74-yard kickoff return late in the fourth quarter, to put the Eagles on the board at 14-8.\n\u2022 HOMECOMING KUDOS: Rob Spicer, a Thurston alum who played in the NFL with the New York Jets, was recognized during the second quarter. Also introduced was coach Don Riehl who led the Eagles from 1954-79.\n\u2022 1969 REVISITED: Members of the undefeated, state champion 1969 Thurston football team (8-0 record) were introduced following the first quarter, to warm applause.\nUnder the leadership of coach William McDonald, the Eagles set a Class A record for consecutive wins. Stepping out onto the gridiron were alums Bob Graustein, John King, Steve Boyak, Larry Marshall, Don Kneller and Bill Lenerz.\n\u2022 REDFORD RAIN: There was a drizzle falling at Thurston during the first half, and the rain came down harder after the 20-minute homecoming intermission. But fans did not budge as the rivals battled for Supervisor's Cup honors.\n\u2022 BACK AND FORTH: The Eagles won the cup back from RU (winners in 2016). Redford Twp. Supervisor Tracey Schultz-Kobylarz presented the trophy following the game.\nRedford Union's Kenneth Perry (7) runs the ball down the sidelines while Thurston's Keysean Ware (7) tries to bring him down.

The law, which took effect Jan. 1, bars police from turning over immigrants in their custody to federal agents.\n\"What it does is it builds off S.B. 54 by expanding to all city departments, to ensure that we are not sharing information that is inappropriate with federal authorities, and that we are really protecting people\u2019s information,\" Garcia said.\nThe measure, named the Long Beach Values Act, calls for protecting the privacy of immigrant residents. No city resources can be used to create registries based on such information as immigration status or religious affiliation.\nThe council is also moving ahead on a proposed legal defense fund for immigrants facing deportation, similar to one the city and county of Los Angeles contributes to. The Long Beach defense fund would be similarly funded with public and private dollars.\nThe Long Beach decision comes as the Trump administration continues to criticize sanctuary cities and follows the federal Department of Justice's suit against California, challenging three state laws, including S.B. 54. The legislation cited in the lawsuit restricts cooperation between local police and businesses on one side and federal immigration agents on the other.\nThe White House issued a statement during Trump\u2019s visit to Southern California this week, stating sanctuary cities are \"endangering both communities and law enforcement.\"\n\"Sanctuary policies in California have allowed the release of numerous criminal aliens charged with serious crimes who could continue to harm communities,\" according to the White House statement.\nOfficials in cities that limit cooperation with immigration agent maintain it is not their job to enforce federal immigration laws. They further argue immigrants would fear police and be unwilling to report crimes and serve as witnesses if local law enforcement cooperates heavily with immigration agents.\n\"We are not an immigration or deportation force,\" the Long Beach mayor said. \"We are focused on bread-and-butter public safety issues and making sure our community is safe.\"\nThe Trump administration has attempted to withhold grant funds from jurisdictions that don't readily cooperate with immigration officials, prompting ongoing legal challenges.\nThe federal suit against California escalated existing tensions between the Trump administration and the state, which is widely seen as the center of resistance against many of the president's policies."}

Interior NVH is the noise and vibration experienced by occupants whereas exterior NVH is concerned with the noise radiated by vehicle. The increase in demand to reduce the noise and vibration in order provide comfort to user and government initiative to make safer and quieter vehicles followed by rise in sales of automotive vehicles drives the demand for automotive NVH materials market.\nGet Research Report Overview @ https:\/\/www.transparencymarketresearch.com\/automotive-nvh-materials-market.html\nAutomotive NVH Materials Market: Segmentation\nBased on materials type, automotive NVH materials can be segmented into rubbers, engineering resins, molded foam and others. Rubbers type accounted for major share of the NVH market and is likely to remain the dominant material type during the forecast period. Rubber based materials are easy to manufacturer and easily replaceable. Also they provide ideal noise insulation and vibration damping. Rubbers have high density due to which they are widely accepted as sound absorbing material in automotive industry.\nBased on vehicle type, automotive NVH materials are segmented into passenger cars, Light Commercial Vehicles (LCV) and Heavy Commercial Vehicles (HCV).Passenger cars accounted for prominent share in the NVH materials market and likely to remain the dominant market during the forecast period. Change in lifestyle and increase in middle class income coupled with supporting financial schemes for purchasing cars have contributed the increase in sales of passenger cars especially in developing countries. All these factors has fueled the demand for automotive NVH materials. Also increase in use of electric and hybrid cars in near future due to environmental regulations is also anticipated to drive the demand for automotive NVH materials during the forecast period.\nBased on application, automotive NVH materials can be segmented into absorption and insulation. Demand for absorption segment contributed major market for automotive NVH materials in 2016 and likely to remain the dominant market during the forecast period. Absorption in automotive is related to sound and vibration absorption. Automotive manufacturers are designing vehicles in order to give customer comfort and smooth ride. Hence, they are increasing the use of sound and vibration absorption materials in the passenger cars and also in LCV and HCV.\nAutomotive NVH Materials Market: Region-wise Outlook\nBased on region, the automotive NVH materials market can be segregated into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Middle East & Africa. In terms of consumption, Asia Pacific held major share of the automotive NVH materials market in 2016. It is likely to remain the dominant region during the forecast period.

However, I feel very strongly that we must not take off the prize. \u201cAir transport and the numerus spin-off businesses must be sustained to keep our economy vibrant.\u201d\nSpeaking briefly was Minister within the Ministry of Public Infrastructure, Annette Ferguson who said that agriculture, forestry, mining, tourism and social services all rest on the back of air transport system.\nShe said that because Guyana is mostly covered by dense forests with limited inter-connecting roadways, and given its wide geographical spread, it must depend on air as a means of transport.\nAs such, she welcomed the upcoming conference, expressing pride at knowing that the high-profile air transport conference would be hosted in Guyana.\nLater on during a panel discussion, Chief of Economic Regulatory Framework at the ICAO, Peter Alawani told the audience that the ICAO chose to support Guyana, based on its observation of Minister Ferguson\u2019s support of the initiative, and the potentials which exist in the region.\n\u201cImpressed by her participation and zeal, the President of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, Olumuyiwa Aliu felt there was need to support Guyana, and to place Guyana on the world map and to see how we can further support the development of transport in the Caribbean,\u201d he explained.\nIn 2017, Minister Ferguson accepted the President\u2019s Council Certificate, which was awarded to Guyana at the ICAO World Aviation Forum, for being one of the world\u2019s most improved states for Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) in aviation.\nPACKED AGENDA\nAccording to Director-General of the Guyana Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA), Egbert Field, representatives of the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), FedEx as well as the World Trade Organisation and World Tourism Organisation will all deliver presentations at the conference.\nThe five-day agenda will include topics on: National aviation issues; how Guyana can invest in aviation; harmonisation and the economic benefits; liberalisation of air cargo; stimulation of investment and the promotion of air links between Africa and the African Diaspora.\nHe, too, attributed the interest shown in Guyana to the works of the Ministry of Public Infrastructure in recent years, and the country\u2019s efforts to uphold international standards in aviation.\n\u201cGuyana has moved very, very strongly upward in the ladder of compliance with ICAO,\u201d Field said, adding:\n\u201cICAO is looking at Guyana as one of the model counties. This is what the Council and the President have seen, and they see the promise; they see that there are a number of aviation priorities that the government is placing emphasis on, hence the request for Guyana to host this coming conference.\u201d\nResponding to a query from General Manager of Air Services Limited (ASL), Annette Arjoon-Martins as to whether there are plans in the pipeline to utilise air transport to develop Guyana\u2019s agriculture sector towards becoming the breadbasket of the region, Alawani said:\n\u201cAviation is the most regulated industry. Even when you have the produce, you also need agreement among states for you to be able to transport those goods.\nREMOVING THE BARRIERS\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why one of the things that will be addressed in this conference is how to remove all those regulatory impediments, to the extent that we can legalise air cargo and the free movement of goods and cargo, not just amongst the region but all over.\u201d\nIn closing, Alawani, whose purpose for being in Guyana is to assess the country\u2019s ability to host the event, said that based on his observations and interaction with the local planning committee, he is very impressed by the country\u2019s preparedness for the conference."}

But whether you\u2019re planning a getaway to another coast or continent, the thought of being away from home can bring about feelings of anxiety (mixed in with those butterflies of excitement).\nThese jitters can exist because you\u2019re traveling solo or maybe because you\u2019re nervous about flying in general. You might even be traveling with the fam and anxious about the awful things you\u2019re hearing about in different parts of the world. \u201cIt\u2019s natural to feel nervous when roaming outside our comfort zones, especially in a new, unfamiliar setting or when far from friends or family,\u201d licensed psychologist Lauren Hazzouri, PsyD, founder of the online community for young women called #HeyLauren , tells Teen Vogue .\nAnd it\u2019s important to know that you are not the only one. \u201cAfter all, many of us experience travel anxiety in the best of circumstances,\u201d Hazzouri explains, and \u201chearing about sad events on the news ups the ante.\u201d And factor in that anxiety is incredibly common \u2014 a quarter of teens experience it , and many aren\u2019t receiving treatment.\nHere are some ways to cope with anxiety and fear, while traveling.\nTake control of your thoughts.\nHazzouri explains that \u201cin anxiety-provoking situations, our \u2018negative thought voice\u2019 holds on to dribs and drabs of data, piece-meals them together and comes up with irrational conclusions that make us feel uneasy and scared.\u201d\nKeep this in mind: Thoughts are not facts. \u201cInstead of buying into what your anxious thoughts are telling you, challenge your thoughts and replace them with more realistic truths,\u201d Hazzouri advises. If you\u2019re nervous about traveling and having something bad happen, keep in mind, \u201cfor example, you\u2019re statistically more likely to experience a car accident than a terror attack or plane incident,\u201d she says.\nFocus on deep breathing & relaxing your muscles\nYou know that feeling you get when you\u2019re nervous? Your breath quickens, your muscles tighten, and your heart rate increases. This is basically your body\u2019s natural response to stress and anxiety, aka the fight-or-flight response, and it makes the perceived threat seem dangerous, even when it\u2019s not. To combat this physiological response, take a few minutes to breathe, and then tense and release your muscles.\nHazzouri explains how it\u2019s done: \u201cTo start, focus on your breath. Breathe in through your nose for 3 to 4 counts, hold for 3 to 4 counts, and slowly exhale. Repeat. Next, start your progressive muscle relaxation exercise and start with the muscles in your face. Tense the muscles as tightly as you can for several seconds and release. Progressively work down your body to your neck, shoulders, arms, hands, abdomen, buttocks, legs, and feet.\u201d\nThis is super important to try, because as Hazzouri puts it: \u201cYour body can't be in panic mode and relaxed at the same time.\u201d So achieving a chilled out state will help keep your nerves at bay.\nUse your senses to practice mindfulness.\nUsing your senses \u2014 sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell \u2014 and keeping a safe distance from your negative and catastrophizing thoughts can help you relax and get present, now.\nTo be mindful of the moment and help you relax on a plane, or a crowded beach or street, Hazzouri suggests engaging your senses whenever you can (for example, listening to people chatting, savoring the taste of your gum or gelato, and consciously smelling things like foods permeating from restaurants or the in-flight coffee from the beverage cart). According to Hazzouri, \u201cEngaging your senses has the power to hold your focus in the here and now. Remember: you\u2019re always okay right now!\u201d\nDo not cancel outings or avoid scenarios (unless you have a legitimate reason to).\nAccording to Hazzouri, avoiding anxiety-provoking situations is the equivalent of feeding a stray cat. \u201cIf you avoid it, it doesn\u2019t go away \u2014 EVER\u201d, she says. \u201cIt not only comes back, it comes back with friends.\u201d\nSo what can you do? Get the facts about your destination(s), take safety precautions, be vigilant and aware of your surroundings at all times, and savor these precious life-building experiences (even if those pesky jitters creep on you every now and then).\nHazzouri offers this advice: \u201cLife is all about showing up (even when it\u2019s uncomfortable). It\u2019s time we all get comfortable being uncomfortable. Using evidence-based skill sets is a sure way to help you enjoy your daily life here, there and everywhere. It\u2019s better to live out loud uncomfortably than stay stuck in your comfort zone. As it turns out, that\u2019s not living at all.\u201d\nRelated: Gina Rodriguez Watched a Video of Herself Having Anxiety for an Important Reason"}

And the target of their taunts is focused on another goal, according to his sister.\nThe non-athletes will not be allowed to attend a school sporting event the rest of the year, according to Steve Hogen, the district athletic director for Mesa Public Schools.\nThe athletes will have to sit out a specified amount of games.

And how.\n\u201cHis biggest challenge will be leading the further calibration of interest rates when the US economy is late cycle amid a synchronized global economic upswing and fiscal stimulus is on its way,\u201d Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics told AFP.\n\u2013 Yellen legacy \u2013\nAs Yellen departs, the only Fed chair in nearly 40 years not to be reappointed for a second term, she leaves an economy with unemployment at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent \u2014 half the rate when she became chair \u2014 quiet inflation and nearly four years of uninterrupted growth.\nIn addition, she steered the Fed out of its massive bond buying program and began the process of \u201cnormalization,\u201d or reducing the size of investment holdings, without upsetting the skittish financial markets.\nYellen prevailed in the debate to raise interest rates only gradually to ensure the economic recovery was on solid footing. The Fed has raised the key lending rate five times in her tenure, including three times last year.\n\u201cYellen hands the incoming Chair Jerome Powell a more \u2018normalized\u2019 economic and monetary policy environment,\u201d Bostjancic said.\nThe Fed in December raised the benchmark lending rate for the third time last year, and indicated that another three hikes were likely this year.\nBut the minutes of the meeting show there was heated debate among the policymakers about how quickly they would need to move this year based on differing outlooks for inflation and the impact of the tax cuts.\n\u2013 Powell\u2019s challenge \u2013\nInflation has remained stubbornly below the Fed\u2019s two percent target, but the policy statement last week said the central bank expects prices to move up in the near term.\nThe first rate increase of 2018 is widely expected to come in March, which also will feature the first press conference by Powell, who has served on the Fed board since 2012.\n\u201cMassive fiscal policy piled on top of an economy that was growing solidly and has limited labor availability has not been tried before,\u201d economist Joel Naroff said.\n\u201cHow this \u2018Grand Fiscal Experiment\u2019 affects wage and price inflation is something Fed has to be worried about.\u201d\nIn practical terms, raising rates more quickly has challenges.\nThe Fed can decide to move at any time, whether it has a policy meeting scheduled or not, but officials like to telegraph their intentions to markets clearly to avoid any upset, and explain the decision once it has been made.\nSo since 2011, the committee has only announced rate changes at one of the quarterly meetings that include press conferences by the Fed chair. That means a faster pace of rate hikes would mean four rather than three this year.\nMore increases than that could really spook markets into thinking the Fed is seeing real cause for concern about the threat of inflation or the durability of the recovery."}

Hannibal is widely considered one of the greatest generals of the ancient world - outmanoeuvring the might of the Roman army and ruling much of Italy for 15 years. His Carthaginian forces originated in Tunisia but made an unlikely quest across the Mediterranean, capturing much of Europe before arriving in Italy. Hannibal famously led his forces - complete with war elephants - over the alps into Italy, and captured much of Rome in a surprising victory. He was later defeated in a counterattack that pushed his forces back to North Africa. During their retreat, the Carthaginians lost control of the Iberian peninsula around 211 BC, and with it some of the richest silver mines of the Mediterranean world. Revenues from the rich Spanish silver mines coupled with booty and extensive war reparations from Carthage, helped fund the expansion of its territory.\nThe finding, which gives a tangible record of the transition of Rome from a regional power to an Empire, is to be presented today at the Goldschmidt geochemistry conference in Paris.\nScientists analysed silver content from a group of coins made either side of the Second Punic War from 218-201 BC, regarded as one of the pivotal events of European history.\nDuring the conflict, Hannibal initially inflicted a shock defeat on the Romans, only to be defeated himself in a counterattack that pushed his forces back to North Africa.\nDuring their retreat, the Carthaginians lost control of the Iberian peninsula around 211 BC, and with it some of the richest silver mines of the Mediterranean world.\nRevenues from the rich Spanish silver mines coupled with booty and extensive war reparations from Carthage, helped fund the expansion of its territory.\nNow geochemical analysis of coins from the time have provided proof of the importance of the Spanish silver to the Roman conquest.\nA group of German and Danish scientists led by researchers at Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany, analysed 70 Roman coins dating from 310-300 BC to 101 BC, a period which bracketed the Second Punic War.\nThey were able to show that lead in the coins made after 209 BC has distinctive chemical signatures, which identified most of the later coins as originating from Spanish sources.\nBefore the war, Roman coins were minted using the same Aegean silver as Greek cities in Italy and Sicily.\nHannibal's defeat meant the Romans captured the silver mines of the Iberian peninsula, bringing so much silver into the Roman empire that it can be traced through the coinage (pictured), scientists say\nAs the conflict turned to the Romans' favour around 209 BC, and as silver as booty and reparation payments flowed into Italy, the silver used was Iberian, meaning each coin had a far higher silver content.\n'This massive influx of Iberian silver significantly changed Rome's economy, allowing it to become the superpower of its day,' study coauthor Dr Katrin Westner, of the Institute for Archaeological Sciences at Goethe University, Frankfurt, said.\n'We know this from the histories of Livy and Polybius and others, but our work gives contemporary scientific proof of the rise of Rome.\nThe effects of the Romans' eventual defeat of the Carthaginian leader Hannibal (fresco pictured), who famously led his forces - complete with war elephants - over the alps into Italy, can still be seen today, a new analysis of ancient coins has found\n'What our work shows is that the defeat of Hannibal and the rise of Rome is written in the coins of the Roman Empire.'\nCommenting, Professor Kevin Butcher (Department of Classics and Ancient History, University of Warwick, said:\n'This research demonstrates how scientific analysis of ancient coins can make a significant contribution to historical research.\n'It allows what was previously speculation about the importance of Spanish silver for the coinage of Rome to be placed on a firm foundation.'"}

But I\u2019d say that\u0092s more of the same for this Raiders team.\nDon\u2019t let anyone try to spin it: Sunday\u2019s 26-15 loss to the Chiefs wasn\u2019t nearly as close as the final scoreline indicated.\nIt was an embarrassing display \u2014 a limp performance in a game that was as close to a must-win as any Week 14 contest could be \u2014 and another clear-cut case of why serious changes need to be made at all levels of the Raiders\u0092 organization.\nNo, the Raiders haven\u2019t technically been eliminated from playoff contention, but what reason does anyone have to believe that this team will rise to the occasion and win their final three games of the season to give themselves even the remote shot of making the postseason?\nThe Raiders have now played three critical road games as underdogs \u2014 at Buffalo, vs. New England (in Mexico City), and at Kansas City \u2014 and have been blown out three times.\nThe Raiders can beat bad teams \u2014 they can stay with mediocre teams, too \u2014 but when this team needs to win and they have to play a good team outside of the Coliseum, they\u2019ve been utterly overmatched.\nThey were again in Missouri:\nKansas City effectively won Sunday\u2019s game with 3:22 left in the third quarter, after taking a 26-0 lead. At that juncture, the Raiders had 77 yards of total offense and fewer first downs than the Chiefs had scoring plays (six to four).\nForget the 191 yards and two touchdowns in garbage time \u2014 the Raiders real performance came in the first 42 minutes of Sunday\u2019s game. That\u0092s the one that should be remembered.\nFor a normal organization, a performance like that, parlayed with the disappointment of the team\u2019s 6-6 start leading up to it, would prove to be the impetus for major changes \u2014 clearly, there are rings broken on the Raiders\u2019 chain \u2014 but there\u2019s no guarantee that will be the case with this franchise.\nExpectations have exposed this Raiders organization\u2019s flaws. For the first time in a long time, Oakland was expected to be a playoff team. Few paid any mind to the fact that the Raiders were effectively an 8-8 team last year that had an incredible (and unsustainable) run of late-game success \u2014 this team\u2019s arrow was viewed as pointing straight up and nothing was off the table for it.\nFans are always optimistic, so you can\u2019t fault Raiders fans one bit for expecting big things from this team.\nBut this Raiders coaching staff and, subsequently, the Raiders\u0092 roster clearly bought into their own preseason hype and it\u2019s proven to be anchor this season.\nWhen this team wins \u2014 no matter the opponent they beat \u2014 it\u2019s a validation of that preseason hype and an opportunity to let anyone who questioned that hype know that they were wrong to doubt.\nWhen this team loses \u2014 as they did Sunday \u2014 it creates a crisis of confidence. Fingers are pointed, people are thrown under the bus, and people lash out.\nAll that shouldn\u2019t be surprising. When you expect big things (a Super Bowl) but have never proven that you can actually do the things necessary to achieve such successes (beat a good team on the road), your emotions are beholden to the moment.\nAs such, this Raiders team has been an emotional roller coaster all season, and thirteen games into this disappointing campaign, they\u2019re still yet to prove that they\u2019re anything more than an average team.\nHad the expectations going into the season not been so high \u2014 had the Raiders not bought into the outside hype instead of stoking the fire \u2014 the Raiders\u2019 2017 season wouldn\u2019t be viewed in such a negative light.\nAfter all, in order to be disappointed, you must first fail to meet expectations.\nBut it\u0092s too late for the Raiders to fix that now.\nSo what happens next?\nThere\u2019s plenty of blame to go around, for sure, but the two most important people on an NFL team \u2014 the head coach and starting quarterback \u2014 are well-insulated from repercussions.\nJack Del Rio, who took over a laughingstock outfit and turned it into a respectable unit, cashed in after last year\u2019s flukey 12-win campaign, signing a four-year contract extension earlier this year.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that Del Rio has never proven that he can take a good team and make it great as a head coach, as was his task this season. Nor does it matter that he\u2019s a defensive-minded (and hands-on) head coach and former linebackers coach who can\u2019t put a good defense on the field or develop a good linebacker.\nTo fire Del Rio, Mark Davis, who handpicked Del Rio and rewarded him with a lucrative new deal in February, would have to first admit that he was wrong about the Raiders\u2019 head coach and then eat a big chunk of cash that frankly, he might not have lying around.\nDavis might be peeved about the Raiders\u2019 lack of competitiveness, but can he swallow both a ton of pride and cash? I doubt it.\nAnd Carr? We\u2019re in the first year of a five-year, $125 million contract that was, for a while, the most lucrative in NFL history.\nBut behind one of the best-paid offensive lines and going up against one of the worst defenses in the NFL, Carr didn\u2019t look worth $25,000 a year when the game was actually in the balance on Sunday.\nHe was skittish, unaware, and inaccurate \u2014 but that\u0092s nothing new for him.\nAnd when the outcome of the contest was no longer in doubt and Kansas City was laying off, he was able to find success, but even then, he was a dink-and-dunk quarterback who wasn\u2019t all that great at either dinking or dunking.\nBut remember: he looked good against the Dolphins\u2026\nStill, the Raiders aren\u2019t going to cut him or trade him \u2014 don\u2019t be ridiculous. He\u2019s the first worthwhile quarterback this team\u2019s had since Carson Palmer, so he\u2019s getting a free pass. WIth that huge contract, the Raiders have tied the franchise to Carr, for better or for worse.\nSo who is going to be held accountable for this perceived debacle of a season?\nUnderlings. Subordinates. Lackeys.\nThe kind of people you change out when you need to make a show but who can\u0092t truly change the course of a franchise.\nOffensive coordinator Todd Downing? He\u2019s as good as gone. He was hired because he was Carr\u2019s confidant, but that relationship hasn\u2019t resulted in the quarterback\u0092s evolution.\nAnd while interim defensive coordinator John Pagano will probably stick around for next season, he\u2019ll be on the hot seat all next season \u2014 the first guy to go if things don\u2019t change with the NFL\u2019s worst defense.\nPerhaps there will be a shakeup of the team\u2019s power structure, but that doesn\u2019t truly matter. Del Rio and Reggie McKenzie might not work in concert after this season, but since McKenzie isn\u2019t without blame in the Raiders\u2019 predicament either, what\u2019s it matter who has the upper hand in that relationship?\nThe blunt truth is that without a great head coach and a great quarterback, you don\u0092t stand much of a chance of being great in the NFL (unless you have a great head coach and a great defense \u2014 so that excludes the Raiders). We\u2019re now in year three of this Del Rio-Carr partnership and these two men are still yet to prove they\u2019re anything more than average at their jobs but have been rewarded as if they\u2019re amongst the elite in the NFL.\nMaybe the duo of Del Rio and Carr can get this Raiders team over the hump in the years to come. Perhaps with expectations off their shoulders next season, they can show what they\u2019re worthy of the Raiders\u2019 faith and compensation.\nBut when the expectations were raised this season, both men have wilted.\nIsn\u2019t it more likely that this brand of eventful mediocrity is all this duo can provide?"}

The city is predicted to have temperature ranging between 40 and 42 degrees Celsius.\nThe wind is likely to blow from northwest to north during the period.\nAccording to the information available on the met department website, the maximum temperature (47.8) recorded in Karachi in the month of May was on May 9, 1938.\nRelief for Karachi\nWhile the rest of the province is expected to have hot to very hot weather in coming days, met officials have stated that coastal winds will help break the heat spell the city has been experiencing for the past few days, providing the much-needed relief residents want in the month of Ramazan.\nThe sea breeze, according to the department, will restore gradually from Friday along the coastal belt bringing Karachi temperature to normal range of 35-37\u00b0C during next week.\n\u201cToday (Wednesday) was Karachi\u2019s hottest day of this year,\u201d said Shahid Abbas, regional director of the met department in Karachi, adding that it was the peak hot day.\nExplaining the factors contributing to hot weather conditions in the city, he said: \u201cFirst, there was light\/calm wind, which supports rise in temperature. The moisture content level was 4 to 6pc that also contributes to dry, hot weather. In addition, the atmosphere was laden with dust particles, which trap heat and shoot up temperature.\u201d\nAccording to him, these factors made the day different and created intensely hot conditions. People who protected themselves from the hot wind and remained indoors felt comfort even without using their air-conditioners.\nHe predicted that temperature in the city would normalise in coming days, though upper areas of the country would experience warm weather as well as Multan to Nawabshah belt.\n\u201cThe time between mid May to mid June has been the warmest period in Pakistan over 50 years. Presently, there is no forecast for a weather system this year that could provide some relief,\u201d he noted, adding that weather patterns were changing and weather becoming intense.\nDr Seemin Jamali, the executive director of Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, also overseeing its emergency section, said though a few people came with symptoms of heat exhaustion, there was no serious case related to heatwave.\n\u201cThere has been no serious case so far (which can be attributed to the current heat spell). A few people came post-Iftari with complaints of fever and loose motions, but that is a normal occurrence in Ramazan,\u201d she said, adding that there had been no death exclusively due to heatstroke.\nDr Jamali advised people to continue with the preventive steps they had taken.\n\u201cThis time is different because people are generally more aware and practically taking steps to protect themselves. I think the media needs appreciation for playing a positive role in this regard. It\u2019s also good that schools have been closed down in this season,\u201d she said.\nPublished in Dawn, May 31st, 2018"}

{"id":"11c701ac-76f4-4ec7-9167-7f587d067ef5","text":"Whitney tells a maddeningly familiar story: the one about talent squandered on drugs; the one about a bright, brilliant girl who became a spent woman. Church solos beget record deals beget sold-out stadiums. A meteoric rise; a swift crash and burn. All the greatest hits.\nIt\u2019s a well-worn tale, but that doesn\u2019t diminish the scale of its tragedy. Whitney, the new Whitney Houston documentary by Scottish filmmaker Kevin Macdonald, opens with a montage of colorful mid-\u201980s optimism: Smiling blonde kids hawk Coca-Cola and McDonald\u2019s while Ronald Reagan waxes poetic about American promise, all set to the buoyant, synth-heavy sounds of \u201cHow Will I Know,\u201d from Houston\u2019s 1985 self-titled debut. Then static takes over the screen, and Macdonald cuts to footage of the riots of 1967 in Newark, New Jersey. Houston had been born there just a few years earlier.\nThat contrast haunts the rest of the film, which, unlike last year\u2019s urgent Showtime documentary Whitney: Can I Be Me, directed by Nick Broomfield and Rudi Dolezal, was made with the approval of the late singer\u2019s estate. That doesn\u2019t mean Whitney pulls its punches; despite, or maybe because of, the participation of Houston\u2019s family, Whitney takes an unflinching look at its subject\u2019s life and death. Much of Macdonald\u2019s story will be familiar to those who\u2019ve seen Broomfield and Dolezal\u2019s version. But because Whitney boasts as talking heads Houston\u2019s close friends and family, it paints a slightly more intimate, personal portrait of the record-breaking artist.\nThose family members include Houston\u2019s mother, the gospel singer Cissy Houston, who sang backing vocals for Aretha Franklin, Elvis Presley and Cissy\u2019s niece, Dionne Warwick. Macdonald films Cissy in the Newark church where she worked as the musical director, and where her daughter sang as a child before the family moved to East Orange, New Jersey. At first, Whitney gives off the unpleasant whiff of dirty laundry being aired, as the members of Houston\u2019s inner circle, speaking alone in front of the camera, dish on the family\u2019s secrets. For the first third of the film, Whitney is cluttered with the voices of people who are not Whitney Houston \u2014 as opposed to Amy, the Oscar-winning 2015 documentary on Amy Winehouse, which never cuts to a person talking straight to the camera, but rather layers voices over footage of its subject.\nUnlike that film, Whitney\u2019s director is an off-camera presence; we hear him pose questions, sometimes unnervingly intimate ones \u2014 \u201cDo you think she liked sex?\u201d he asks a childhood friend of Houston\u2019s. Bobby Brown appears partway through \u2014 apparently the singer is mounting a comeback, complete with a new album and a series on BET \u2014 although Houston\u2019s ex-husband somewhat laughingly refuses to acknowledge her drug problem. \u201cDrugs has nothing to do with her life,\u201d he insists, as if he could will that to be true. It\u2019s cool that Macdonald was able to get Clive Davis, the man who \u201cdiscovered\u201d Houston, to sit down for an interview, but it\u2019s not terribly illuminating to hear the octogenarian talk about how blown away he was when he first heard Whitney Houston\u2019s voice and its \u201cprofound impact\u201d on him. Houston sold some 200 million records during her too-short career; the \u201cimpact\u201d that had on his own bottom line would\u2019ve been profound indeed.\nThe montage of her early chart-topping success echoes much of Can I Be Me, which focused on Houston\u2019s final tour. Can I Be Me featured more footage of Houston singing, but both films highlight the stress and confusion of \u201ccode-switching\u201d to appeal to white America without losing who she was and betraying where she came from. (Houston\u2019s former hairstylist remarks that The Bodyguard shoot was the first time the stylist had been around that many white people.) And Whitney tells a similar story about Houston\u2019s relationship with her close confidant and onetime artistic director, Robyn Crawford, who was pushed out of the Houston orbit in 1999. There\u2019s lots of fascinating, revealing footage of a young Whitney goofing off backstage with her brothers or cuddling up to Cissy while mother and daughter bitch about Paula Abdul (she \u201cain\u2019t shit,\u201d according to Whitney) and Janet Jackson. You just be you, Cissy instructs, as Whitney nuzzles her on a green room couch, like a puppy. Just be yourself and that\u2019s what\u2019ll shoot you to the top.\nAnd she was right, except it\u2019s never that simple, not with so much money at stake. In the end, it\u2019s useful to hear from the until-now shadowy chorus of Whitney Houston insiders: Late in the film, when Macdonald plays a clip from Houston\u2019s infamous 2002 interview with Diane Sawyer (\u201cCrack is wack!\u201d), I found myself cringing not at Houston\u2019s erratic behavior but at Sawyer\u2019s inquisition; at one point, she pulls out a picture of Houston looking emaciated while performing a Michael Jackson tribute and confronts her subject with it \u2014 we have hard evidence of your deterioration right here! Just as shocking as that performance photo is Houston\u2019s participation in the interview itself. Why was she out there on the front lines defending herself, while all the people who were all too happy to enable her addiction if it meant staying on the payroll got to remain anonymous?\nAlthough Cissy is interviewed early in the film, Macdonald never revisits her \u2014 not even after two family members confide to the camera that Houston confessed to being sexually abused by a family member as a child. That\u2019s around the time I started to feel guilty for wishing, early in the film, that Macdonald would tune out the noise of the Houston family and just let Whitney sing; there\u2019s some spine-tingling footage of her early concerts, and when he includes her first TV appearance, in 1983, Macdonald is wise enough to let Houston sing uninterrupted. By the time Whitney winds to an end, that massive talent feels like a dangerously valuable resource, one that even the people who were supposed to protect Houston couldn\u2019t resist exploiting."}
{"id":"2a46d99b-686e-483c-ab19-edd741744399","text":"Before President Donald Trump took office, the sports world began to fill with discussions of whether championship-winning teams would want to make the traditional White House visits during his administration. As it turned out, among major sports leagues last year, the Warriors abstained while the Patriots, Cubs and Penguins went, albeit with some absences, but the Eagles present a noteworthy test case.\nFor one thing, they won the Super Bowl title after a season marked by Trump's repeated attacks on NFL players who protested during the anthem, with particularly inflammatory remarks by him leading to widespread Week 3 demonstrations that included owners. For another, Philadelphia has a number of players who have been outspoken in their criticism of Trump and their support for social causes, and several have long since stated that they would not visit his White House.\nThen there's the owner of the Eagles, Jeffrey Lurie, who was among those who joined players in the demonstrations. On the same day his team said it was \"discussing the logistics of an upcoming visit to Washington,\" Lurie was quoted as having offered some distinctly anti-Trump sentiments last season.\nThat's according to the New York Times, which reported Monday that it had obtained a recording of an October meeting that included NFL owners, players and league executives. Lurie was said to have told attendees that many owners \"have no interest in supporting President Trump.\"\n\"This is not where you brandish a group of people because they own assets in a sport we love, supporting what many of us perceive as, you know, one [expletive] disastrous presidency,\" Lurie reportedly added.\nIt remains to be seen how Trump reacts, if at all, to the comments published in a newspaper he loves to attack. In the case of the Warriors last year, Trump made a point on Twitter of rescinding the team's \"invitation,\" after Stephen Curry said he and his teammates \"don't stand for\" the president's statement's and policies.\nWhile the Times noted that Lurie followed his comments at the meeting by saying, \"Don't quote me,\" a few of his players have been happy to put their antipathy to Trump on the record. In an April 2017 video, defensive end Chris Long said, \"[When] my son grows up, and I believe the legacy of our president is going to be what it is, I don't want him to say, 'Hey, Dad, why'd you go [to the White House] when you knew the right thing was to not go?' \"\nLong made a point of showing support for Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins while the latter was raising his first during the anthem last season, and Jenkins was among the leaders of a group of players whose negotiations with the league over the protests contributed to the October meeting. Jenkins has also said he would not visit the White House, as has Philadelphia wide receiver Torrey Smith, who called Trump \"the most divisive person in this entire country\" in a September tweet he subsequently deleted.\nIn February, Smith told CNN's Don Lemon that there were \"plenty of guys who said they do not plan on going\" on a possible trip. They include, per reports, running back LeGarrette Blount and defensive end Brandon Graham, and it seems a near-certainty that the boycott would also include recently acquired defensive end Michael Bennett, a former Seahawk who has been one of the league's most prominent protesters and supporters of exiled quarterback Colin Kaepernick.\nOn Monday, though, an Eagles spokesman said the team has \"been in contact with White House representatives and are currently discussing the logistics of an upcoming visit to Washington.\"\n\"We are honored to receive this invitation and view this not only as an opportunity to be recognized for our on-field accomplishments, but also as an opportunity to engage in productive dialogue with the leaders of our country,\" the spokesman added.\n\"We have been in conversations with the Eagles about timing and are working with them to make it happen,\" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said (via the Times). \"We hope to have something finalized in the next couple of weeks.\"\nIf the Eagles do make the trip, there will be plenty of attention paid to the amount of players who wound up staying away, as well as any interactions between Trump and Lurie. Of course, for a franchise that finally won its first Super Bowl trophy and first NFL title since 1960, it very much makes for the proverbial nice problem to have."}

And their angry reaction to Flynn\u2019s exit signals the unpopularity of the move with a vocal segment of Trump\u2019s base.\nTrump loyalists \u2014 meaning the true believers who supported Trump from the start, not Republican politicos who became attached later on \u2014 have been privately musing about getting rid of Priebus. Now, that musing is going public. \u201cI think this is Pearl Harbor for the true Trump supporters, the Trump loyalists,\u201d said Roger Stone, a former Trump campaign adviser and longtime Republican operative who still has a relationship with Trump. \u201cI believe Reince Priebus moved on General Flynn and I think he intends to move on Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller next. He is not serving the president well. The people he hired are loyal to the Republican National Committee, not the President of the United States.\u201d\nAt Breitbart, the right-wing outlet that until recently was run by White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and has served as a loyal defender of Trumpism, the narrative was set early with a piece by editor-at-large Joel Pollak questioning the role of U.S. intelligence agencies in the leaks that brought down Flynn. Pollak and other Trump defenders are arguing that the real story is the fact of the leaks themselves, and not what was leaked.\n\u201cThe fourth and most worrying explanation is that the government was not merely monitoring the communications of Russian diplomats, but of the Trump transition team itself,\u201d Pollak wrote. \u201cThe fact that the contents of Flynn\u2019s phone conversation\u2014highly sensitive intelligence\u2014were leaked to the media suggests that someone with access to that information also has a political axe to grind.\u201d"}

Two federal courts already have ruled against the ban. Potential transgender recruits will have to overcome a lengthy and strict set of physical, medical and mental conditions that make it possible, though difficult, for them to join the armed services.\nMaj. David Eastburn, a Pentagon spokesman, says the enlistment of transgender recruits will start Jan. 1 and go on amid the legal battles. The Defence Department also is studying the issue.\nEastburn told The Associated Press on Monday that the new guidelines mean the Pentagon can disqualify potential recruits with gender dysphoria, a history of medical treatments associated with gender transition and those who underwent reconstruction. But such recruits are allowed in if a medical provider certifies they've been clinically stable in the preferred sex for 18 months and are free of significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas.\nTransgender individuals receiving hormone therapy also must be stable on their medication for 18 months.\nThe requirements make it challenging for a transgender recruit to pass. But they mirror concerns President Barack Obama's administration laid out when the Pentagon initially lifted its ban on transgender service last year.\nThe Pentagon has similar restrictions for recruits with a variety of medical or mental conditions, such as bipolar disorder.\n\"Due to the complexity of this new medical standard, trained medical officers will perform a medical prescreen of transgender applicants for military service who otherwise meet all applicable applicant standards,\" Eastburn said.\nLast year, then- Defence Secretary Ash Carter ended the ban on transgender service members, allowing them to serve openly in the military. He said that within 12 months \u2014 or by July 2017 \u2014 transgender people also would be able to enlist.\nTrump, however, tweeted in July that the federal government \"will not accept or allow\" transgender troops to serve \"in any capacity\" in the military. A month later, he issued a formal order telling the Pentagon to extend the ban. He gave the department six months to determine what to do about those currently serving.\nTrump's decision was quickly challenged in court, and two U.S. district court judges have already ruled against the ban. Part of one ruling required the government to allow transgender individuals to enlist beginning Jan. 1.\nThe government had asked that the Jan. 1 requirement be put on hold while the appeal proceeds. The Pentagon move Monday signals the growing sense within the government that authorities are likely to lose the legal fight.\n\"The controversy will not be about whether you allow transgender enlistees, it's going to be on what terms,\" said Brad Carson, who was deeply involved in the last administration's decisions. \"That's really where the controversy will lie.\"\nCarson worried, however, that the Defence Department could opt to comply with a deadline on allowing transgender recruits, but \"under such onerous terms that practically there will be none.\" Carson, who worked for Carter as the acting undersecretary of defence for personnel, said requiring 18 months of stability in the preferred sex is a reasonable time."}

The Dearborn school is \u201cfairly well-resourced,\u201d Blair said, but it is not representative of the overall state of public education in Michigan.\nMichigan, which is DeVos\u2019 home state, has low rates of academic achievement. Critics say this is partly because of policies pushed by DeVos herself. DeVos is a proponent of policies that expand access to charter schools and private schools. Critics say such policies hurt traditional public schools.\nIn response to DeVos\u2019 confirmation, Blair said there has been an increase in engagement from people who want to protect public education."}

There was no fencing around but we were so thankful that we could start somewhere because we had a high lost to follow up,\" said Sylvia Haoses, the Tsumeb district TB and Leprosy coordinator.\nSenior Medical Officer at the Tsumeb District, Dr Jean Kalala Kabangu added that a burden has been lifted from the hospital since the establishment of the DOT point at Kuvukiland.\n\"Most of our patients are coming from Kuvukiland. We had times where patients were not coming for treatment due to the distance.

He explained that the area was unfit for to construct a proper clinic as it would cost government a lot.\nThe Public Affairs Officer at the US Embassy in Namibia, Eric Atkins said accessing HIV care and treatment at the community level saves patients time and money, and increases the likelihood that patients will access health services and improves quality of life.\n\"From the perspective of the healthcare provider, it reduces pressure on district hospitals and improves the level of services provided through primary care,\" said Atkins.\nAs a result, the healthcare providers can focus their services on sick patients who are in greatest need of attention of a doctor or a nurse, he said.\nHowever, one of the challenges is that sufficient clinic space, housing and dedicated areas for specific services is not always available.\nThe U.S President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) through its agencies Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) provides support to the Ministry of Health and Social Services to increase its clinic space.\nThis is done through the provision of prefabricated structures that can be used as clinics, TB DOT sites, TB and HIV integrated services sites and modular housing for employees of the health ministry.\nThrough the Cooperative Agreement (COAG) with CDC, the US government has provided 65 prefab structures at 30 sites in six regions.

Raven said there was \u201cmind-blowing\u201d diversity in the different spiders the scientists collected.\n\u201cUnder one rock, down in a gully with a fresh-water spring pumping through, I found species from six arachnid orders.

They're about the size of two sugar grains stuck together,\u201d Raven told NPR. \u201cBut you can actually see them flashing away in the sun, with these beautiful colors, as they go into the courtship behavior with the female. And, of course, if they get the wrong female, then they\u2019re dinner.\u201d\nThe scientists are currently identifying and photographing all the species they found and checking their findings with past discoveries to make sure none are duplicates. They\u2019ve also put the giant tarantula in a tank in the lab to observe how it reacted and discovered it can stay underwater for hours at a time without emerging.\n\u201cThe spider ran straight into the water, totally immersed, and remained there for at least four hours until we were too bored waiting for it to come up,\u201d Raven said.\nEven though he works with spiders every day, Raven himself has a fear of the eight-legged creatures.

With the changing nature of warfare, there has been a rise in demand for efficient and lethal weapons with high precision and accuracy and ability to annihilate distant enemy tanks. These laser systems have high intensity and low divergence, which has made it a popular choice of weapons in times for warfare. Moreover, increasing support and initiatives from the government for strengthening their defense is another factor boosting the growth of Military Laser Systems Market.\nLASER is an acronym that stands for \u201clight amplification through the stimulated emission of radiation.\u201d Lasers work by exciting the atoms, molecules, or ions in a medium\u2014think gases, chemicals, fibers, or diodes\u2014until they emit light at exactly the same wavelength. That light is then channeled into a narrow beam by a resonator, and then directed at a target. In other words, lasers are essentially narrow beams of focused light that do damage by heating the target. They can burn holes in aircraft skins, the hulls of small boats, or the human body. They can heat artillery shells in midair, causing them to explode, or the storage containers at a fuel dump until the fuel ignites.\nAccording to a recent study report published by the Market Research Future, Globally, the Market For Military Laser Systems has increased its market growth in recent years and is expected to grow at a rapid pace during the forecast period (2017 \u2013 2021). The global market of Military Laser Systems is forecasted to witness a thriving growth by 2021, surpassing its previous growth records in terms of value with a striking 10 % CAGR during the anticipated period (2017 \u2013 2021).\nThe growing need for high precision weapons, emerging demand from law enforcement and defense agencies, investment on R&D related to military laser systems are the factors driving the market growth. Additionally, growth in usage of high-speed laser in communication networks and rising support and initiatives from government such factors are providing added impetus to the growth of the market. Moreover, growth in commercial technologies is said to offer an array of opportunities for the key players operating in this market.\nHowever, regulatory challenge and the higher costs of development are the biggest constraint of the market, states the MRFR Research Analyst while commenting upon this deep diving factual study report, presented through more than 100 market data tables and figures, widely spread over 103 pages.\nKey Players\nMilitary Laser Systems market appears to be highly competitive. Key Players compete based on cost, product quality, reliability, and aftermarket service. To sustain in the market and to gain the competitive edge players operating in the market strive to offer cost-effective and high-quality laser systems with latest technology and materials. The market is expected to witness a rise in mergers and acquisitions, coupled with increased collaboration with alliance partners across the globe.\nProfiled in MRFR Analysis some of the leading market players in the global Military Laser Systems market are Northrop Grumman, Coherent Inc., Lockheed Martin, Thales, Raytheon, American Laser Enterprises, BAE Systems PLC, Frankfurt Laser Company, Quantel, and Newport Corporation.\nFor further information on this report, visit @ https:\/\/www.marketresearchfuture.com\/reports\/military-laser-systems-market\nRegional & Country Analysis\nAmericas is the leading region in military laser market with around 40% of market share as of 2015, followed by Asia Pacific and EME with a substantial market share. As per the MRFR analysis, the Americas Military Laser Systems market is poised to reach to astronomical amounts in 2021, to grow at a CAGR of around 5% during the forecasted period. EMEA and Asia Pacific regions will grow at a substantial CAGR.\nWith the increasing investment in several military and land programs to modernize its military and weapon systems, APAC is expected to register a significant growth in the forecast period. In 2015, North America accounted for the largest share of the military laser systems market. However, the Middle East region witnessed the highest growth rate in the military laser systems market in the coming years. This can be attributed to the enhancement in the force protection against small boat swarms, unmanned aerial vehicles or rocket, artillery, and mortar or missile attack in this region."}

He is a technocrat and not a politician and has not in any form or shape shown indications of wanting to contest election, and so, it stands to reason that those behind his posters flooding Abuja have a sinister plot to achieve and their message is also clearly directed at their target audience, hence, the choice of Abuja as their location for the posters.\n\u201cFor the sake of argument, let us admit that Dr. Kachikwu has an interest in the governorship of Delta State, is Abuja the place to start pasting posters? What is the correlation between Abuja and Delta governorship? But, of course, they want to insinuate that he was seeking the Abuja blessing, which of course invalidates the whole idea.\n\u201cThis is why we have come out to state for emphasis and for the umpteenth time that Dr. Kachikwu is not interested in the governorship of Delta or any other elective political office as he currently has a more challenging and critical national assignment, which he has been able to discharge creditably well in the last over a year in spite of the attendant challenges in that office.\u201d\nHe said the propensity to want to destroy others without any justification remains a major preoccupation of both the active and the passive players in this part of the world and invariably, the bane of underdevelopment in the country.\nHe said, \u201cNothing can explain the attack on Dr. Kachikwu because as far as we are concerned, this is an attack on the career of a man, who is focused and determined to make a change in the best way possible and as permitted within the limitations of his office. He deserves support and commendation and not to make him appear unduly ambitious or losing sight of his current brief.\n\u201cBut if this is targeted at influencing the rumoured imminent cabinet reshuffle by those who find his ongoing reforms in the system discomforting or a move by those who want to mount pressure on him run for Delta governorship, it is dead on arrival, because Dr. Kachikwu is not oblivious of the weight of the assignment on his hands and is leaving nothing to chance in making sure that the government of President Muhammadu Buhari succeeds.\u201d\nDisclosing that they have commenced investigation into those behind the campaign, the TCN leader warned that if they failed to desist from such act, they would be held liable.\n\u201cIs it a crime for a man to be adept at his work? It is surprising that after stabilising the sector and still cleansing it of its corrupt past, this is all that Kachikwu gets. But whatever creepy plans they are hatching, he is one man, who will leave government unblemished and very successful,\u201d he said."}

The two are active teachers working at High Tech High in San Diego, California \u2014 and arrived on request from Charles City staff members.\nCharles City Middle School teacher Julie Holub visited High Tech High in June, as part of the school district\u2019s second, 10-person trip to the California charter school.\n\u201cWe just kept saying, \u2018oh my goodness, I just wish they could come to Iowa and talk to a bigger group than just us ten,\u201d Holub said. \u201cThat one question turned into what we have today \u2026 I think it was valuable for us ten to go, because we came back very excited, like we could do this in our Charles City school district.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re living it. They are taking what they\u2019re passionate about, which is being a life-long learner, and they\u2019re allowing kids to drive what they need to know,\u201d she said.\nWalker focused the discussions using the same set of brainstorming tools High Tech High teachers use in the classrooms, he said.\n\u201cA lot of this stuff is stuff that we use with our students, but it\u2019s also stuff that we use when we\u2019re training new teachers,\u201d Walker said. \u201cIf there\u2019s something that works with students, it should also work with teachers. What works with teachers will also work with students. They\u2019re not these separate kinds of people that need special treatment.\u201d\nSuch a complete change in approach means teachers are rethinking workplace habits they had developed over an entire career, as Holub personally experienced.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been given 125 students for the year, and you want to give them everything that they need \u2014 you worry about, what if I didn\u2019t give them the skills or the tools for the next step, to get to eighth grade or to get to high school?\u201d Holub, who has taught for 20 years, said. \u201cThat\u2019s the hard part of letting it go. What I\u2019m giving them in the long run will give them more benefits, because they\u2019ll be thinkers, they\u2019ll be able to research, to collaborate and answer their own questions.\u201d\nAs teachers in the school system evolve the style of their curriculums, Walker said, people will learn to adjust to what a school day should look like.\n\u201cThe hardest habit to break would be that school looks like people sitting in rows, doing worksheets, listening to lectures and taking tests,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThose still have their place in project-based learning, but in traditional schools, that\u2019s it \u2026 Now we\u2019re thinking, let\u2019s get far away from that and start thinking about student interest.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d say the hardest habit for the community is expecting education to look like what it looked like when they went through school,\u201d he added. \u201cThat had a certain look to it, and this doesn\u2019t look like that.\u201d\n\u201cIt is going to be hard,\u201d Holub said. \u201cAfter being to High Tech High I have more confidence, and I have more understanding. You feel like you\u2019re doing the right thing.\u201d"}

{"id":"083f871f-e002-4417-b4e3-8b032131adb4","text":"A celebrated Arctic marine biologist, Louis Fortier has hauled up many a sea creature over the span of his career. But ask him about the one that got away and Dr. Fortier has something bigger than fish on his mind.\nAs he hosts a conference on Arctic change in Quebec City this week, attended by about 1,500 colleagues, the Laval University researcher is also looking ahead to the scientific activities he will oversee aboard the Canadian Coast Guard ship Amundsen next summer.\nWith financial support from a Swiss billionaire and promise of an escort from a more powerful Russian nuclear icebreaker, Dr. Fortier had originally proposed a scientific expedition to circumnavigate Greenland and use the Amundsen's facilities and autonomous underwater vehicles to study how the edge of the country's melting ice sheet is interacting with a warming ocean.\nStory continues below advertisement\n\"That's crucial. It's how we're going to understand whether, by the end of this century, the sea level will have risen by two metres or three metres,\" Dr. Fortier told The Globe and Mail.\nBut, to his chagrin, Coast Guard officials rejected that trip after months of planning. Instead, the Amundsen will spend its time closer to home in Canadian Arctic waters.\nAsked about the decision, a Coast Guard spokesperson said it was \"based on the results of operational and technical risk assessments, which concluded that risk to the vessel was too great.\" However, the spokesperson added, there was also a secondary consideration that the Amundsen might not get back in time for its non-scientific role as an icebreaker in the Gulf of St. Lawrence next winter.\nThe matter is a sensitive one for Dr. Fortier and ArcticNet, the academic-research organization for which he acts as scientific director. To make good use of the Amundsen, the network depends on a close working relationship with the Coast Guard, its captains and crew. And Dr. Fortier is quick to point out that Arctic science in Canada had accelerated dramatically since the Amundsen was refurbished and outfitted as a research ship a decade and a half ago. However, the ship spends only part of its time as a floating laboratory and each year it alternates between that job and ice breaking.\nLast spring, with heavy ice conditions off the Newfoundland coast, the Coast Guard opted to keep the Amundsen on icebreaker duty, delaying the start of its scientific work and forcing the cancellation of a Hudson Bay expedition leg. The decision meant that experiments, long prepared, were not carried out and, for some graduate students, work needed to complete PhDs was delayed for at least a year. The longer-term impact is that studies that depend on environmental measurements made at regular intervals become scientifically compromised when there are gaps in the record.\nIn 2014, the Amundsen was similarly retasked with little warning when two other icebreakers were directed by the federal Conservative government to journey to the North Pole in a show of Canadian sovereignty. Now, the cancellation of the Greenland excursion again shows how scheduling and other priorities can take precedence over the ship's scientific returns.\nThe frustration, Dr. Fortier said, is that other non-Arctic countries including Britain, France, China and South Korea are pressing ahead with fully dedicated research ships for working in the Arctic without such constraints. Canada, which oversees a vast share of Arctic territory, risks being left behind even as climate change accelerates the transformation of northern ecosystems and the communities that depend on them.\nStory continues below advertisement\nStory continues below advertisement\nDr. Fortier said he has been working on ways to finance a separate vessel for Arctic research in Canada through academic and private sponsors that he estimates would cost $150-million. In comparison, the Diefenbaker, the long-awaited next generation Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker, is projected to be launched around the mid-2020s with a price of more than $1-billion.\nAt the Quebec meeting, the largest annual Arctic science conference in the country, researchers are set to discuss every aspect of the changing North, from marine life to human health. But in the background there is some uncertainty as ArcticNet's federal funding officially expires in March.\nBy being parsimonious with its resources, the organization will have a modest research program this year, executive director Leah Braithwaite said. It will also have an opportunity to compete for funding in the new year, something that was previously prohibited for research networks that have already won federal money twice (in the case of ArcticNet, for two successive seven-year cycles). However, the pool of available funding is smaller than ArcticNet's current budget, Ms. Braithwaite said, so even if the network is successful it will likely be making due with less and working around a \"gap year\" in its program."}

(Photo by Kyusung Gong\/Contributing Photographer)\nLONG BEACH \u2014 He doesn\u2019t consider himself the Shohei Ohtani of the Big West Conference, even though he hits when he isn\u2019t pitching and pitches when he isn\u2019t hitting and would do both at once if he could.\nIf you said Clayton Andrews is more like the collegiate Jose Altuve, he\u2019d go for that.\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard about my size forever,\u201d Andrews said the other day, before Long Beach State\u2019s practice at Blair Field.\n\u201cI don\u2019t look at myself as the small guy who can play. When Altuve won the MVP last year, I absolutely enjoyed that. He\u2019s such an inspiration for the guys on the smaller end of the spectrum.\u201d\nAndrews is 5-foot-6. In many ways, he brings as much nostalgia as his ballpark does.\nAs a center fielder, he has struck out six (6) times all season, which, he says, is his career high. His on-base percentage is .380.\nOn the mound, he has struck out 70 batters in 61 innings, with only 13 walks, even though most college coaches literally overlook pitching prospects who aren\u2019t as tall as they are.\nAndrews\u2019 only drawback is that he\u2019s only one man. He couldn\u2019t single-handedly plug the injury flood that has dealt Long Beach a 16-24 record.\n\u201cWe lost 170 innings of pitching from last year,\u201d Coach Troy Buckley said. \u201cIt\u2019s been an outlier season. Having Clayton around is like having one of those beacons on a really foggy day.\u201d\nThe Dirtbags limit Andrews\u2019 throwing during practice, especially when he has a bullpen session scheduled. Otherwise, he does the full program.\nHe says he\u2019s fairly hyperactive anyway. \u201cI hope I\u2019m not driving the coaches crazy,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I really hate sitting still.\u201d\nHe struck out 11 apiece against UC Irvine and Cal State Fullerton. He became the first man to be named Big West Player of the Week and Pitcher of the Week in the same season.\n\u201cMy size is an advantage when I pitch,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cGuys might think I\u2019m a slowball pitcher, and I think I\u2019ve surprised some of them.\u201d\nIn truth, Buckley gives a plus-plus to Andrews\u2019 changeup and likens him to Tony Sipp, a small, effective lefty for Houston and Cleveland.\nIt isn\u2019t unusual for pitchers to double-up on their high school teams or even in college. Dodgers reliever J.T. Chargois was a lethal hitter at Rice. Buckley said Jason Vargas, who made the All-Star Game as a lefty for Kansas City last year, was the best hitter on his Long Beach State team.\nOhtani is making it work with the Angels and hit fourth in the lineup on Sunday. In the process, he has become a national sensation and, if we\u2019re lucky, an inspiration.\nThis isn\u2019t like Chuck Bednarik playing center and linebacker and never coming off an NFL field. This is doable and sensible.\n\u201cWhat kid doesn\u2019t want to put on the eye black and go to the plate and take his hacks?\u201d Buckley asked. \u201cWhen you have too much specialization, guys really miss out on a lot. Eventually, a coach will say, \u2018Son, you can\u2019t hit, so you\u2019re just going to pitch from now on.\u2019 But the kid doesn\u2019t have to hear that when he\u2019s 11 or 12.\n\u201cI know of three 11-year-old pitchers in this area who have had UCL surgeries. When all you do is pitch, that\u2019s going to happen. When you\u2019re out there, hitting and playing, you\u2019re using your whole body, all the athleticism that you have.\u201d\nThe DH itself is a solution to a problem that has long disappeared.\nThis is the 50th anniversary of the Year of the Pitcher, when Don Drysdale broke the record for consecutive shutout innings and MLB teams scored 3.42 runs per game, lowest since 1908.\nThe American League went to the DH in 1973. The OPS went from .649 to .710. It reached .795 in 1996 and was .753 last year.\nThe offense needs no help, but the DH sticks around, having taken over every province of baseball but the National League. It takes up salary and roster space, and room on the Hall of Fame ballot.\nAs much as we love David Ortiz, how can he ride his half-innings to Cooperstown when Omar Vizquel can\u2019t get in with 2,877 hits and the all-time record for most games at shortstop, where he won six Gold Gloves and fielded .985 for 24 years?\nIs there another Walter Johnson out there, who hit .433 when he was 36 years old? Or a Ken Brett, who homered 10 times in 347 career at-bats?\nA scholarship-strapped college program needs more like Clayton Andrews. So does a game that challenges us mightily to sit still."}

Schools are judged against a measure titled Progress 8, which looks at the progress a pupil has made between the end of primary school and the end of secondary school. Their results across eight GCSEs are then compared to their achievement of other schoolchildren with similar abilities. It was introduced in 2016, and is designed to encourage schools to offer a balanced and broad curriculum with a focus on an academic core eight subjects at key stage four. Every increase in every grade a pupil achieves will provide additional points in the performance table. How is it calculated? The pupil's Attainment 8 score is taken (for example, 56), it is then compared to the national average for pupils in the same prior attainment group. A pupil's progress score is the difference between their actual Attainment 8 result and the average result of those in the same attainment group. For example, if David, achieved an attainment score of 56, and the aver Attainment score for his group was 55, his progress score would +1. Then the +1 is divided by 10, to given an individual pupil's Progress 8 Score, which this would be 0.1 in this example. Then the final step is to add all of the Progress 8 scores of all the pupils in year 11 together, and dividing them by the number of pupils in the school.\nThe Department for Education has said the rise in the number of under-performing schools is due to technical changes to the points system used by statisticians who calculate a school's performance.\nThe rise in figures also comes following major changes to England's exams systems and the new grading system, which includes English and maths GCSE new 9-1 grades and other subjects in the traditional A*-G grades.\nSchool leaders have said the new grading system for English and maths has complicated how school performance is calculated, because it has to be worked out combining the old and new grading systems.\nHow have the new GCSE 1-9 grades affected the performance? According to the DfE, the new GCSE qualifications in English and mathematics, which are graded 1-9, will be included in the performance tables, with others to follow in the future. Points are allocated to the new GCSEs on a 1-9 point scale corresponding to the new grading scale, for example, grade 9 will get 9 points in the performance measures. Unreformed GCSEs and other qualifications will be mapped onto the 1-9 scale from 2017, with 8.5 being the maximum points available for GCSEs that are unreformed.\nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: \"As the DfE itself says in today's statistics, these changes are the main reason why there has been an increase in the number of school which are deemed to be below the 'floor standard' for progress 8.\n\"It is extremely unfair that more schools find themselves in this situation because of complex changes to the way in which this is calculated.\"\nEssex district's Progress 8 scores:\nBasildon: 0.01\nBraintree: -0.20\nBrentwood: 0.06\nCastle Point: -0.07\nChelmsford: 0.07\nColchester: -0.01\nEpping Forest: 0.09\nHarlow: -0.05\nMaldon: -0.02\nRochford: -0.05\nTendring: -0.17\nUttlesford: 0.02\nThe worst schools in Essex:\nA strong pass in both English and mathematics GCSEs, is considered between the grades 9-5 of the new exam system.

Following our complaint, the board discovered that nearly all the remaining candidates about which we enquired did have the correct grade.\n\"We carry out extensive investigation into every outcome learners achieve and we compare year on year to see whether each subject is improving or not.\n\"Our data-set goes back many years and the curriculum we offer has been pretty consistent over that time, so we know that the comparisons we undertake are as valid as they can be.\n\"We also organise for our staff to spend time in local schools looking at practice so that we can learn from anything that others are doing that is successful.\"\nChase View School\nAndrew James, Headteacher of Chase High School, sent a letter home to parents, staff and governors regarding the publication of the league tables.\nThe letter read: \"Chase is a rapidly improving school and though we know we still have some way to go so that more children achieve the highest grades, we are delighted with the improvements we have seen since April 2015.\n\"Attendance is the highest we have known it, behaviour is consistently good or better, and the quality of learning in the classroom is the focus of our work every day.\n\"The reality is that before the examinations last summer we predicted accurately what those results would be.\n\"The December examinations for the current Year 11 pupils shows that we can confidently predict that next summer's GCSE results will see a big improvement on these new measures that have been brought in by the government.\n\"The deputy headteacher is always happy to explain the new data processes with interested parties and is willing to meet with any parents who would like a detailed explanation of how these new measures operate.\"\nSir Charles Kao UTC said:\n\"The UTC are joining BMAT to add capacity to improve the outcomes for our young people.\"\nCastle View School said:\n\"Castle View School is committed to ensuring that all students have the opportunity to succeed and achieve at least in line with other students nationally. Since 2016 and the appointment of a new Headteacher the standards of teaching, learning and outcomes are improving however the impact of the changes needed time to impact.\n\"Whilst attainment for students who finished in 2017 improved as a result of the improvements in the short term, progress was below the government\u2019s floor target for groups of students.\n\"The school has recently undergone a full inspection (December 2017) and the recently published report indicates progress, attainment, teaching, learning and assessment are improving and this is reflected in the \u2018good\u2019 judgement for leadership and management.\"\nWhat is Attainment 8?

The Scotland international has been the joker in Villa\u2019s pack and his humour was vital in keeping morale high in the season\u2019s tough moments.\nHe built up a rapport with both the playing staff and supporters, the latter to such an extent that he got a standing ovation every time he trotted over to take a corner at Villa Park.\nSnodgrass has made a friend for life in John Terry and he\u2019s also played an understated role in Jack Grealish\u2019s rise this term.\nSpeaking before the play-off final, Snodgrass said: \"I came on loan to Aston Villa to be part of something special, to try and help them get back into the Premier League.\n\u201cI can\u2019t say it was a straightforward decision, though, because I had a situation where I could only go on loan to a Championship club.\n\u201cThe owners at West Ham wouldn\u2019t let me go to a Premier League club. There were four or five Championship clubs interested and Aston Villa were 16th or 17th at the time, so it looked as if it would be tough for them to get promotion.\n\u201cBut I assessed it and thought: \u2018If there\u2019s one team that could kick on, it will probably be them.\u2019 And I knew most of the staff here which was a big factor.\"\nHutton's prayers\nOut of contract defender Alan Hutton says he\u2019s \u2018struggling to come to terms\u2019 with Aston Villa\u2019s play-off final defeat to Fulham.\nHutton made 33 appearances for Villa last season and excelled at left-back.\nHis future is now up in the air, though, and the 33-year-old full-back is free to join another club.\nManager Steve Bruce said prior to the play-off final that Hutton would be offered a new contract regardless of the outcome.\nBruce explained: \u201cI can confirm to you now we will be talking to him next week, whichever division we are in. He deserves it.\u201d\nHutton is desperate to stay at Villa Park and hopes the club can keep the current crop of players together as they aim for promotion at the third time of asking.\nHutton posted on Instagram: \u201cStill struggling to come to terms with the game on Saturday, really disappointed we couldn\u2019t get over the line for everyone involved with the club.\n\u201cA massive thank you to the fans for the amazing support, it\u2019s been incredible all season long.\n\u201cI just (pray) we can keep this amazing group of lads together as I know we can get back to the Premier League.\u201d"}

The contract outlines Los Angeles' financial responsibility in hosting the Games, including covering shortfalls if the $5.3 billion plan runs into the red. In addition, a budget for the proposed 2028 Games has not been completed.\nThe vote followed a morning-long committee hearing that mingled civic cheerleading and salutes to Olympic champions past with warnings about potential costs and suggestions the international event would drive up housing costs and drive out the homeless.\n\"This opportunity is too great, we cannot pass it up,\" council President Herb Wesson Jr. said.\nAdvertisement\nThe vote took place less than two weeks after the city announced an agreement with international Olympic leaders ceding the 2024 Games to rival Paris, while opening the way for Los Angeles to host the 2028 Games.\nThe U.S. Olympic Committee board of directors must also approve the deal. The International Olympic Committee vote to award the two Olympics is scheduled for September in Lima, Peru.\nCity analysts concluded that the 2028 plan, while incomplete, included significant safeguards for taxpayer dollars. The Olympics have a notorious history of runaway costs, but city officials have argued their proposal can stay within budget by relying on the region's many existing stadiums and arenas, including the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and Staples Center.\nLos Angeles had bid on the 2024 Games, but embraced the 2028 alternative after Paris emerged as the front-runner for 2024 and the IOC proposed the unusual dual award.\nAt one point during the sometimes tense meeting, Councilman Joe Buscaino shouted at a heckler, \"This is right for the city.\" As the vote was being taken, protesters yelled from the back of the council chamber, \"Let us speak\" and \"sellout.\"\nSteve Ducey of No Olympics LA, an opposition group, said the vote would take place without an independent budget analysis.\n\"Shame on you,\" he said.\nMuch of the meeting amounted to a choreographed tribute to the city's Olympic legacy, with frequent references to the LA Games in 1932 and 1984 and the athletes who competed in them.\nOlympic champions Carl Lewis and Janet Evans, who are part of a private committee behind the bid, urged approval of the plan.\nLewis, holder of nine Olympic gold medals in track and field, said the Games are not just an event, \"it's about a whole city.\"\nThe deal comes with millions of dollars of financial sweeteners for accepting the later date. However, the extra four years pose challenges for Los Angeles from maintaining public interest to rewriting deals for stadiums, arenas and housing that were all hooked to 2024.\nCity analysts recommended the council approve the contract, which faced an Aug. 18 deadline, but also emphasized a revised budget for 2028 could take months to complete.\n\"There are inherent risks to hosting such major events so far into the future,\" city analysts noted in a report on the agreement.\nThe bulk of the revenue for the Games is expected to come from ticket sales and corporate sponsorships.\nPart of the deal includes creation of a reserve fund to cover any cost overruns, with the city kicking in $270 million. The state is expected to commit a similar amount, but because of the legislative calendar the state might not be able to consider its piece of the proposal until next year.\nIn a statement, Mayor Eric Garcetti called the agreement \"the deal of a lifetime.\""}

The company is expected to debut a production-ready version of the 01 Wednesday at the 2017 Shanghai Auto Show. Key design features of the 03 Concept will also be revealed at the auto show, according to the company.\nLynk & Co., which came out of stealth less than than six months ago, is a hybrid of sorts. The brand falls under China's Geely Auto Group and its products are designed and engineered in Sweden where Volvo is based. Geely Auto Group, a subsidiary of Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, owns Volvo Cars and London Taxi Company.\nThe Lynk & Co. brand will be used to launch the first vehicle based on the Compact Modular Architecture (CMA) platform developed by Geely and Volvo. This means the 01 crossover SUV and the 03 four-door sedan will likely have a similar chassis.\nThe company describes itself as a new kind of car brand that can meet the needs of a global and connected populace. This is code for a company that intends to provide Internet-connected services and apps that consumers already find on their smartphones as well as untraditional means of ownership. The connected car platform in the cars will make them suitable for sharing, for instance. The company also appears to be developing a subscription-based model, according to its announcement on the 03 design concept.\nAlain Visser, senior vice president of Lynk & Co., says the company will offer a lifetime warranty and free Internet connectivity on every vehicle to \"further underline our determination to challenge the traditional business model of the car industry.\"\n\"We believe Lynk & Co. will offer the most connected cars in the world, with the world's first in-car digital share function.

But for the full year, rents rose 2.85 percent for Class A and 4.13 percent for Class B apartments.\nSo far developers have been reluctant to lower rents for new apartments even though the number of empty units has increased slightly, but \"record supply and occupancy have tamped rents down a little,\" said Ron DeVries, vice present of Appraisal Research.\nDeVries said 2018 could represent a peak in Chicago's apartment market, however. The supply of rental units \"will exceed demand and keep rents in check,\" he said.\nPeople who sign leases in brand-new buildings are likely to be offered deals such as a couple of months of free rent.\nBy the first quarter of 2018, DeVries expects \"a lot of angst in the market\" as there is a sense of \"a bubble.\"\nThere are now 8,005 rental units in 23 buildings under construction and 10 other buildings in the process of getting potential renters to sign leases. By early 2018, the number of units in new Class A and B buildings will be 40,000 units, or 150 percent more than in mid-2005.\nSo far downtown has been able to absorb new apartment construction fairly well because employment has been growing, especially in such areas as the West Loop, where McDonald's headquarters is relocating from the suburbs and where Google has offices. In 2015, employment in the city grew by almost 80,000 jobs, but that slowed to 59,167 new jobs in 2016, noted Gail Lissner, vice president of Appraisal Research Counselors. Downtown has 120,000 housing units including rentals, condominiums and townhouses. Rentals made up 92 to 100 percent of new residential units added each year from 2011 through 2016, she said.\nOccupancy, or the percentage of rentals leased, was 92.5 percent in the last quarter of 2016. That was down from 93.5 percent a year earlier but still healthy.\nThere will be enough demand downtown to absorb 2,800 units in 2017 and 3,100 in 2018, but that's far short of the supply, according to the report. In 2016 there were 3,830 new units. In 2017, 4,100 are expected, and in 2018 an estimated 3,900 are expected.\nAs the opportunity to fill new rentals declines, developers will consider whether it will be best to build more rentals or condominiums. That analysis already is occurring, although few developers have been able to find ways to make new condo construction profitable enough because of skyrocketing construction costs, taxes, limited available land and lenders often requiring developers to pre-sell many units \u2014 frequently 50 percent \u2014 before being willing to provide construction loans, according to the report.\n\"When the easy money stopped, condo construction went away,\" said Steve Fifield, chief executive of Fifield Cos.\nSince the housing bust in 2009, there have been almost no new condo units built, and those that have been constructed are in relatively small buildings compared with the high-rises of the early 2000s. The units built have been relatively large and ultraluxury, priced around $1 million or more.\n\"The days of the $300,000 two-bedroom units are gone,\" said Alan Lev, chief executive of Belgravia Group. \"The best we can do is around $400,000, which is unfortunate because we are pricing people out of the marketplace.\"\ngmarksjarvis@chicagotribune.com\ntwitter @gailmarksjarvis"}

Britain\u2019s negotiating position in Europe has been misrepresented in the continental press.\n\"The European Commission\u2019s negotiating stance has hardened. Threats against Britain have been issued by European politicians and officials.\n\"All of these acts have been deliberately timed to affect the result of the general election that will take place on 8 June.\n\"By contrast, I made clear in my letter to the President of the European Council invoking Article 50 last month that, in leaving the European Union, Britain means no harm to our friends and allies on the continent.\n\"We continue to believe that no deal is better for Britain than a bad deal. But we want a deal. We want a deep and special partnership with the European Union. And we want the EU to succeed.\n\"But the events of the last few days have shown that - whatever our wishes, and however reasonable the positions of Europe\u2019s other leaders - there are some in Brussels who do not want these talks to succeed. Who do not want Britain to prosper.\n\"So now more than ever we need to be led by a Prime Minister and a Government that is strong and stable. Because making Brexit a success is central to our national interest. And it is central to your own security and prosperity.\n\"Because while there is enormous opportunity for Britain as we leave the European Union, if we do not get this right, the consequences will be serious.\n\"And they will be felt by ordinary, working people across the country. This Brexit negotiation is central to everything.\n\"If we don\u2019t get the negotiation right, your economic security and prosperity will be put at risk and the opportunities you seek for your families will simply not happen.\n\"If we do not stand up and get this negotiation right we risk the secure and well-paid jobs we want for our children and our children\u2019s children too.\n\"If we don\u2019t get the negotiation right, if we let the bureaucrats of Brussels run over us, we will lose the chance to build a fairer society with real opportunity for all.\n\"The choice the country faces now is very simple. Because there are only two people who can possibly be Prime Minister after the 8th of June to negotiate Brexit. It is a choice between me \u2013 and Jeremy Corbyn.\n\"With me you will get strong and stable leadership, and an approach to Brexit that locks in economic growth, jobs for our children and strong finances for the NHS and the country\u2019s schools.\n\"Or you will get Jeremy Corbyn with a hung parliament and a coalition of chaos. Britain simply will not get the right Brexit deal if we have the drift and division of a hung parliament.\n...\n\"Give me your backing to lead Britain. Give me your backing to speak for Britain.

{"id":"fc857009-8ed6-4b52-89b6-e44d605829ff","text":"The hands change temperature for many reasons, and they may feel warm or cold at different times of the day. A person might be worried if their hands are always warm, or even hot. Several medical conditions can cause this symptom, and anyone concerned about a change in their hands should see a doctor.\nA 2008 study may have debunked the adage that cold hands mean a warm heart. Research suggests that warming the hands may lead to feelings of warmth toward other people.\nBut when hands feel unusually warm all the time, increased blood flow, infection, and other medical issues may be responsible.\nPeople who have warm hands should not diagnose themselves based on this symptom alone. Other symptoms and a person's medical history can help a doctor to determine whether something is wrong.\nCauses of warm hands\nThe following medical issues and other factors can lead to warm hands:\n1. External temperature changes\nPhysical activity, changes in weather, and wearing layers over the hands can cause the hands to become warm. Physical activity, changes in weather, and wearing layers over the hands can cause the hands to become warm.\nWhen the weather is hot, the hands may be too. Some people notice that their hands feel very hot after gardening outside in gardening gloves. Any activity that involves the hands being covered in sunny weather can cause them to feel warmer than the rest of the body.\nCold weather can also have this effect, particularly in people who have been wearing gloves or who are very sensitive to temperature changes. In this case, warm hands simply indicate a contrast between the warmth of the body and the temperature outdoors.\n2. Exercise\nExercise increases blood flow, so any activity that involves frequent or intense hand movement can temporarily leave them feeling warm. People who spend long periods typing, writing, or doing grip exercises may notice that their hands feel warm for a few minutes afterward.\nNo treatment or medical follow-up is necessary when movement is clearly responsible for the warmth.\n3. High blood pressure\nBecause increased blood flow to an area of the body can make it feel warm, people with high blood pressure may have warm hands or feet. A simple test can assess whether high blood pressure is a factor.\n4. Cellulitis and other infections\nAn elevated temperature can help the body to fight infection. This is why an infected area tends to feel warm, and the hands are no exception.\nAn infection called cellulitis is often responsible. This infection occurs deep in skin tissue and can spread quickly.\nPeople usually develop cellulitis after an injury, but even the tiniest cut can allow the bacteria to enter the body.\nIf the hands are hot, swollen, painful, or red, cellulitis could be the culprit. Anyone who suspects that they have this condition should see a doctor.\n5. Inflammatory conditions\nInflammation is one way that the body fights infections. Some medical conditions cause parts of the body to be chronically inflamed, allowing more blood to flow to the infected area.\nInflammatory disorders affecting the hands or wrists can lead to an unusual feeling of warmth.\nOne of the most common inflammatory conditions is rheumatoid arthritis. This causes the body to attack joint tissue, leading to swelling, pain, and inflammation.\nPeople with rheumatoid arthritis in their fingers or wrists may have pain, weakness, and difficulty moving these areas.\n6. Carpal tunnel syndrome\nDamage to the median nerve, which is located in the wrist, can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome. An injury, rheumatoid arthritis, problems with the thyroid gland, and cysts can cause this disorder.\nEarly symptoms include numbness, tingling, or burning in the affected hand or wrist. In addition to feeling hot, the hands may shake or feel weak.\n7. Peripheral neuropathy\nPeripheral neuropathy refers to nerve damage caused by another medical condition, often diabetes. It can cause tingling, numbness, and prickly sensations in the hands and feet.\nThe nerve damage can cause the hands to feel hot, even when they are not. Also, some people find that their hands or feet become very sensitive to changes in temperature.\n8. Fibromyalgia\nFibromyalgia affects the nerves and can cause sensitivity to temperature changes. Fibromyalgia affects the nerves and can cause sensitivity to temperature changes.\nFibromyalgia is a long-term condition that involves widespread muscle pain and areas of tenderness throughout the body. It is little understood, but many researchers believe that the pain is caused by nerve hyperactivity.\nSome people with fibromyalgia are sensitive to changes in temperature, and they may have hot or cold sensations in their hands.\nThe pain is often described as burning, so people with fibromyalgia-related pain in the hands may also have a sensation of warmth.\n9. Erythromelalgia\nThis rare disorder often affects the feet and, less commonly, the hands. It remains poorly understood, but some researchers believe that it may be caused by changes in blood vessels.\nErythromelalgia can lead to an intense burning sensation, as well as itching, redness, and a feeling that the hands are hot. This feeling usually lasts for a few hours at a time and often gets worse in very warm weather.\nTreatment\nWarm hands are a symptom, not a medical condition. Not all cases require treatment, and the right treatment depends on the underlying cause.\nA doctor will ask about other symptoms, such as pain. They will also ask how long the feeling of warmth has lasted.\nDepending on the diagnosis, a doctor may suggest:\nHigh blood pressure : lifestyle changes, exercise, weight loss, dietary adjustments, blood pressure medication, and regular monitoring\n: lifestyle changes, exercise, weight loss, dietary adjustments, blood pressure medication, and regular monitoring Cellulitis : antibiotics\n: antibiotics Peripheral neuropathy : treatment for the underlying cause and pain medication\n: treatment for the underlying cause and pain medication Inflammatory conditions : nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), lifestyle changes, physical therapy, drugs that suppress the immune system, and complementary treatments such as acupuncture\n: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), lifestyle changes, physical therapy, drugs that suppress the immune system, and complementary treatments such as acupuncture Fibromyalgia : exercise, antidepressants, medications, lifestyle changes, and complementary or alternative treatments\n: exercise, antidepressants, medications, lifestyle changes, and complementary or alternative treatments Erythromelalgia: NSAIDs and pain medication\nWhen to see a doctor\nIf warm hands cause distress or pain, a person should talk to a doctor. If warm hands cause distress or pain, a person should talk to a doctor.\nWhen the cause of warm hands is likely harmless, such as exercise or a change in weather, a person can wait to see if the warmth goes away on its own. Otherwise, it is important to consult a doctor.\nWarm hands may be the first symptom of a severe medical condition. Receiving medical attention at an early stage can make treatment easier and more effective.\nSeek immediate medical care if warm hands accompany symptoms that can indicate a medical emergency, such as a racing heartbeat, confusion, or a high fever.\nTakeaway\nThe hands reveal a lot about health, and because they play a prominent role in many activities, it may be easier to notice hand-related symptoms.\nTemperature is not always consistent throughout the body. While having warm hands is not always a cause for concern, the symptom can indicate a more serious underlying issue.\nTalk to a doctor when changes in the body's temperature are causing concern. Even when nothing is wrong, the peace of mind is worth the effort."}
{"id":"c1ddf490-be0d-4d68-8f7c-5bd95bba1c2e","text":"DJI is working on a \u201clocal data mode\u201d for its apps that prevents any data from being sent to or received from the internet. The feature will be welcomed by many, but it\u2019s hard not to attribute the timing and urgency of the announcement to the recent ban of DJI gear by the U.S. Army over unspecified \u201ccyber vulnerabilities.\u201d\n\u201cWe are creating local data mode to address the needs of our enterprise customers, including public and private organizations that are using DJI technology to perform sensitive operations around the world,\u201d said Brendan Schulman, the company\u2019s VP of Policy and Legal Affairs, in a press release. The new feature should arrive before the end of September.\nThe Army memo, first published at Small UAS News and dated August 2, said that \u201cdue to increased awareness of cyber vulnerabilities associated with DJI products, it is directed that the U.S. Army halt use of all DJI products.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not clear what these vulnerabilities actually are, or whether the mere possibility of sensitive information being transmitted was enough to spook someone at HQ.\nDJI\u2019s flight control apps, from which users can launch and control drones, does indeed regularly phone home to make sure it is up to date, using current maps and so on. And if the user chose to, it would back-up flight logs and media to DJI\u2019s servers. But the online functions aren\u2019t necessary for ordinary operation and flight, so local data mode doesn\u2019t affect airworthiness or anything like that.\nAlthough DJI was not made aware of the Army\u2019s concerns ahead of time, the new mode has been in development for several months, according to the press release. So either a little bird told the company this was a possibility, or more likely it\u2019s just a smart option to include when your craft and apps are being put into national security and life-and-death type situations.\nA DJI representative told TechCrunch that today\u2019s announcement isn\u2019t in response to the memo. Schulman, however, told The New York Times that \u201cthe Army memo caused customers to express renewed concern about data security.\u201d\nThese statements may seem contradictory, but it\u2019s not hard to imagine that when a major client like the Army raises security concerns, others will join the chorus. So DJI can say the announcement today wasn\u2019t in response to the memo \u2014 not directly, anyway. But chances are we wouldn\u2019t be hearing about the feature until later had the memo not been publicized.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not responding to the Army, which has never explained its concerns to us,\u201d explained Adam Lisberg, DJI\u2019s corporate comms director for North America, in response to my inquiries along these lines. \u201cWe\u2019re accelerating the rollout of something we\u2019ve been working on for a while. We announced it today because enterprise customers with serious data security have made clear they need something like this for a while, and the Army memo reinforced that concern for them. So we\u2019re addressing it quickly as part of our commitment to delivering what our enterprise customers need.\u201d\nIt matters because DJI isn\u2019t a military-specific drone maker, like General Atomics, which makes Predators \u2014 though the chances of a Chinese company ever being so are slim to say the least. It\u2019s also a matter of public image: they\u2019re a company looking out for consumers and the occasional government contract, not a major participator in the military-industrial complex.\nClearly the company wants to signal that it takes its feature requests not from foreign governments, but from its valued users all over the globe, of which the Army happens to be one."}

But even though Zelda is the Switch's killer app, 1-2 Switch is a game which feels right at home on the system. The Nintendo Switch launch title comes with 28 mini-games that showcase exactly what the console can do \u2014 from motion control to making use of Nintendo's new \"HD Rumble\" haptic engine.\nBut is it any good? I had a chance to play 1-2 Switch at a recent Nintendo event and I have some opinions on it. Let's dive in.\nNintendo Switch Games: 1-2 Switch let me shave my face and duel my friends, western style\nIn teaser commercials and tutorial videos people almost always look ridiculous playing 1-2 Switch, but that's kind of the point. Your first time playing, 1-2 Switch is bound to crack you up. Especially if you start off with Runway, a fashion-minded game that forces you to sway your hips as you walk past your opponent. A more dramatic sway leads to a higher score.\nSome challenges required less effort, and the game actually lets you know how much energy you'll be expending with a chili pepper graphic \u2014 one chili for low physical effort, five for intense. As you can guess, Runway was intense.\nOther games like Shave, Safe Crack and Quick Draw were less physically taxing. And then there's Fake Draw, which is the exact same thing as Quick Draw except instead of \"Fire\" the narrator will sometimes say \"Farm\" or another similar-sounding word. Raise your weapon at the wrong word and you've lost.\nAnd I can't leave out Baby. It's a game where you cradle the Nintendo Switch like a baby, which we were, unfortunately, unable to play.\n1-2 Switch is better than Wii Sports, if only because it has five times as many games\n1-2 Switch games list Source: Jacob Kleinman & Xavier Harding\/Mic\n1-2 Switch has 28 games total \u2014 way more than the mini-game-based title that shipped with the Nintendo Wii, Wii Sports. 1-2 Switch also includes sports games like baseball and tennis (in the form of table tennis).\nTo the Switch's credit, the two controllers you need to play are included with the console from the beginning. Wii Sports required you to acquire a second Wii Remote and nunchuck for some of the games, like Wii Boxing.\n1-2 Switch should come with the Nintendo Switch when you buy it\nIn Wii Sports defense, it came free with the console and didn't require you to shell out an extra $50 on top of the console price at launch: a time when one's wallet is most vulnerable.\n1-2 Switch should obviously come with the Nintendo Switch, and we're not the only ones who think so. But if Nintendo is worried about making money, the company could bundle the game with the purchase of added Joy-Con controllers instead since it perfectly showcases what the controllers can do.\n1-2 Switch is solid, ridiculous fun. But it remains to be seen how long the games stay fun. You probably played Wii Sports twice and then never again, but it was virtually free (read: included with the console). Does shaving your face and shaking up virtual soda bottles remain fun six months after you've owned 1-2 Switch? For $50 you better hope so.\nCheck out more Nintendo Switch news and coverage\nCheck out our comparison photos sizing up the Switch to the Wii U GamePad, along with details on the console's price, release date, preorders, battery life and our hands-on review.

{"id":"888b5e70-25e9-4a5b-bdfd-a6467be46a2d","text":"I love when arcane cases at the U.S. Supreme Court prompt trash talking from eminent litigators.\nIn a new Supreme Court brief on behalf of underwriters accused of defrauding California\u2019s state employees\u2019 pension fund, Paul Clement of Kirkland & Ellis warned the justices not to be duped by the pension fund\u2019s sleight-of-hand \u2013 not on the real issue in the case and not on underlying policy.\nClement\u2019s brief accused the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System of \u201cbrazen disregard\u201d for the Supreme Court\u2019s framing of the question presented in the case. And in the event that his first use of \u201cbrazen\u201d didn\u2019t make the point, Clement repeated it later in the brief: \u201cThis court should not reward such a brazen end-run around its explicit decision to limit the grant of certiorari.\u201d\nIn response, CalPERS counsel Thomas Goldstein of Goldstein & Russell told me in an email that he gets why the underwriters have resorted to a \u201chopeless\u201d argument: \u201cTheir argument on the merits of it is just so bad that they had to try something,\u201d Goldstein said.\nPeppery, right? Especially for a securities case that doesn\u2019t have much of a public profile.\nHere\u2019s the background, in case you somehow haven\u2019t been paying attention to CalPERS v. ANZ Securities. Clement represents underwriters, including ANZ, of Lehman Brothers debt offerings from 2007 and early 2008, before the investment bank went under. Those underwriters were sued in a 2008 class action. CalPERS separately sued the defendants in 2011, and, when the class action settled, opted out to continue with its own suit. But in 2016, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that CalPERS had waited too long to sue. Reiterating its 2013 decision in In re IndyMac, the appeals court said the Securities Act\u2019s three-year statute of repose is an absolute time bar that gives defendants the substantive right to be free of the specter of lawsuits after a prescribed time. The statute of repose, according to the 2nd Circuit, cannot be tolled by the filing of class action.\nThe Supreme Court, as you know, ruled in 1974\u2019s American Pipe v. Utah that the filing of a class action tolls the statute of limitations in securities fraud litigation. But the court has also held, most recently and emphatically in 2014\u2019s CTS v. Waldburger that the statute of limitations and the statute of repose are distinct.\nIn 2016, a plethora of certiorari petitions asked the Supreme Court to decide whether American Pipe tolling also applies to the statute of repose. The justices picked the CalPERS case as their vehicle. CalPERS\u2019 petition for certiorari presented two questions: the first about American Pipe tolling and the statute of repose; the second on whether, despite the statute of repose, a member of an uncertified class action can file an individual suit based on the same claims as those of the class. The Supreme Court granted review only of the first question.\nThe issue of whether the statute of repose can be tolled is really slippery. It depends on the nature of repose, different flavors of tolling (it can be equitable or legal) and interplay between the Rules Enabling Act and the federal rule governing class actions.\nAs I reported last month, Goldstein & Russell\u2019s merits brief for CalPERS offered a relatively easy way to grab hold of the question. Instead of grappling with the Rules Enabling Act, equitable authority and substantive rights, the brief said, the justices should simply apply their own American Pipe terminology and conclude that the filing of a class action \u201cbrings the action for all members, whether named or not.\u201d Under that definition, CalPERS \u201cbrought\u201d its case against the Lehman underwriters when the class action was filed, well within the three-year statute of repose for Securities Act claims.\nThat\u2019s the argument that Clement attacked as an improper end-run in the underwriters\u2019 merits brief. In effect, the brief argued, Goldstein & Russell is trying to re-introduce the question the Supreme Court decided not to review. \u201cPetitioner describes this argument as the \u2018easiest path to reversal,\u2019 but that \u2018path\u2019 faces a rather significant roadblock: namely, the fact that the court expressly declined to grant certiorari on this issue,\u201d the brief said. \u201cThat was no accident, as the court was considering multiple petitions, some raising one issue and others raising two\u2026. Undeterred, petitioner has now fully briefed both questions (leading with the non-granted question, no less) despite this court's explicit instructions to the contrary.\u201d\nThe underwriters contend this is actually an easy case. American Pipe established equitable tolling of the statute of limitations when a class action has been filed. The statute of repose is not an equitable principle but a substantive legal right for defendants. If the Securities Act\u2019s three-year time limit on claims is a statute of repose \u2013 as the underwriters argue it is, based, among other things, on the law\u2019s legislative history \u2013 American Pipe doesn\u2019t apply.\n\u201cThis court has made clear that statutes of repose confer substantive rights on defendants to be free from suit after a specified period,\u201d the brief said. \u201cUnder the Rules Enabling Act, courts may not apply the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in a manner that would \u2018abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right.\u2019\u201d\nThe underwriters\u2019 brief also said CalPERS and its amici (who include dozens of other institutional investors, law professors and retired federal judges) have promulgated an evidence-free argument that courts will be flooded with protective opt-out suits by pension and healthcare funds if the Supreme Court agrees with the 2nd Circuit. CalPERS and its amici had said the 2nd Circuit holding would undermine the efficiency class actions are supposed to promote. But according to the underwriters, CalPERS and its friends have come up with only one example \u2013 securities fraud litigation against the Brazilian company Petrobras - of a case that has generated the predicted tsunami of opt-outs, even though it has been several years since the 2nd Circuit first decreed that class actions don\u2019t toll the statute of repose.\nIn fact, the underwriters argued, the Supreme Court has good policy reasons to agree with the 2nd Circuit. When Congress enacted securities litigation reform in 1995, it encouraged institutional investors to step up to lead class actions. If the Supreme Court allows big pension and healthcare funds to back out of class actions whenever they please, the underwriters said, smaller and less sophisticated investors will suffer.\nI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll soon see amicus briefs echoing the underwriters\u2019 policy contentions.

They consume glucose from our food, plus absorb additional glucose from the surrounding blood vessels.\nThis extra energy-sapping means that the brain may drive our metabolisms to work harder than our bodies do.\nIt may also be that the brain is simply having to push more energy to more places when we undertake mental tasks that typically engage more parts of the brain simultaneously, leading to greater fatigue."}

{"id":"9d1a64a1-a6b8-41d4-aace-00a4206bb875","text":"The Rwandan High Commissioner to Nigeria, Ambassador Stanislas Kamanzi, has described micro finance as a potent tool for poverty alleviation and wealth creation. Ambassador Kamanzi who spoke last week at The Bullion Lecture organised by Centre for Financial Journalism in Lagos, believes that micro finance is essential to people-centred development, as it is an important stimulant of the creation of a middle income class that is critical for African economies to substantially take off. Ambassador Kamanzi who was the Special Guest at the lecture said it is important for lay people to understand the tenets and mechanisms of micro finance, challenging financial journalists to play a key role in this connection and to build on synergies with the operators in micro finance.\nHe stated that in the past decade Rwanda has been able to move more than a million people above the poverty line through a combination of strategic investment meant to uplift livelihoods of identified poor communities and tapping their own capacity to solve their problem, with a minimal push from Government. He revealed that micro finance was pivotal in making those strategies work and transform into a success story of poverty reduction.\nGiving further insight into how micro finance has helped to lift millions of people out of poverty in his country, Ambassador Kamanzi said this was achieved through a programme termed Vision 2020 Umurenge, abridged as VUP. He said the programme was created to accelerate the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) at grassroots level, explaining that it combines labour intensive projects providing jobs for active members within communities, while catering social protection for the vulnerable and impotent ones, by way of financial grants for daily subsistence.\nHe stated that \u201cVUP builds on assessing the fundamental needs of beneficiary communities, mobilizing resources, human and financial, to correct development shortfalls\u201d, explaining that \u201cbeneficiaries are enrolled in saving schemes, with the objective of promoting the emergence of micro-investment and sustainable self-reliance\u201d. According to him, VUP implementation was combined with the streamlining of micro finance institutions at Local Government (Sector entity) level called UMURENGE SACCO, for the promotion of savings and ease of access to credit within rural communities.\nAmbassador Kamanzi added that micro finance also proved to be a problem-solver as far as improving livelihoods of indispensable professionals whose big numbers defy any attempt for significant salary increase, relative to other macro-economic considerations, especially in developing African Countries. He stated that \u201cin Rwanda UmwalimuSACCO was established in 2006 to that end. Its creation was triggered by the need to expand financial services to teachers including in rural areas. The MFI has more than70,000 members, with very high rural penetration. It has substantively empowered teachers to have easy access to credit to finance projects contributing to the elevation of their well-being\u201d.\nThe result of these efforts has been a quantum leap by the Rwandan economy. The economy of Republic of Rwanda, a landlocked East African country that suffered from one of the worst genocides in contemporary history, has been growing at about 7.0% per annum. Rwanda\u2019s economic growth has been so impressive that the World Bank and other international agencies see it as a model and, in fact, a replica of the celebrated South East Asian economic miracle."}

The Leafs have only had a handful of 1-0 victories the past 15 years.\nThe winner originally was credited to defenceman Jake Gardiner, a slap shot that barely made it through Edmonton goalie Laurent Brossoit\u2019s pads and over the line.\nPerhaps NHL officials heard Hyman\u2019s between-periods interview on the big screen where he was asked about the goal and said he deflected it, in fact it had broken his stick.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t matter (who scored), it was just a big goal to start the game,\u201d Hyman said.\nBIG MAC SPECIAL\nCurtis McElhinney was part of the historical note, making 41 saves, seven short of his career best game, with the Columbus Blue Jackets on April 11, 2015 against the Islanders.\nMore than 30 Edmonton shots came his way in the final 40 minutes.\n\u201cIt felt great,\u201d McElhinney said of making the most of a rare start. \u201cThe back-to-backs are always tough, sometimes there is not a morning skate so you\u2019re kind of left to your own devices.

They know McElhinney prefers solitude.\n\u201cI don\u2019t really talk and the guys, if they have something to discuss on-ice, they\u2019ll talk to (Andersen).

Rizzo drove Matt Harvey's first pitch over the left-center fence at Citi Field for his 15th home run of the season Wednesday, prompting excited high-fives from giddy teammates in the dugout.\n\"I am statistically the greatest leadoff hitter of all-time,\" Rizzo said after the game. \"I would like to retire there.\"\nChicago Cubs' Anthony Rizzo (44) runs past New York Mets catcher Travis d'Arnaud after hitting a home run during the first inning of a baseball game Wednesday, June 14, 2017, in New York.

With some 90 million Americans who snore habitually, the app\u2019s potential market is huge. The game involves moving a character across the phone\u2019s screen to blast falling objects.\nThe player controls the character\u2019s movements by saying \u201cnee\u201d and \u201cnaw\u201d to send it to the right or left, respectively. Making the sounds exercises upper airway muscles to reduce snoring. \u201cYou move the back of the throat through a full range of motion,\u201d Krohn said. \u201cIt\u2019s like doing a perfect pushup for your tongue.\u201d\nEight snorers who used the Soundly app in a pilot clinical study saw an average decline in snoring of more than 20 percent with a decline of up to 60 percent for some, said Dr. Umesh Goswami, Soundly\u2019s medical director and a sleep medicine physician at the University of Minnesota.\nAs the app\u2019s launch approaches, Krohn is testing what people would pay for it. Comparisons include brain-training apps, which charge $9.99 to $14.99 a month. Getting the pricing right could determine whether Soundly emerges as a sustainable small business, tanks altogether, or takes off to become something much bigger.\n\u201cIf we can nail our cost of customer acquisition and the lifetime value of those customers is high then we can easily take on half a million or a million dollars of investment and try to skyrocket from there,\u201d Krohn said. \u201cThat\u2019s the curve you\u2019re looking for.\u201d\nSoundly is the name of the smartphone game and of the start-up that\u2019s building and marketing it. Krohn, CEO and co-founder, and others began developing the app at the University of Minnesota\u2019s Earl E. Bakken Medical Devices Center. Soundly launched in May, one of a record 18 start-up companies started in the 2017 fiscal year from the Venture Center at the U\u2019s Office for Technology Commercialization.\nSoundly was a semifinalist in the Life Science\/Health IT division in the 2017 MN Cup competition for entrepreneurs.\nFor now, Krohn is running Soundly as a \u201csuper lean\u201d start-up. The only financing is from grants, including $50,000 for commercialization research from the National Science Foundation and about $14,000 from National Institutes of Health for a clinical study done at the Fairview Sleep Center. Krohn, the company\u2019s only employee, works mostly from his home in St. Paul.\nKrohn is putting ads on social media and search engine sites to attract more users to the Soundly app\u2019s beta version. Potential users include post-menopausal women who may experience an increase in snoring; women baby boomers who use health tracking and wellness apps or devices; and longtime snorers who have failed to find relief through sleep clinics or other technologies.\nKrohn began work on the app as an Innovation Fellow at the Medical Devices Center. He arrived there as a Rhodes Scholar with master\u2019s degrees in environmental policy and the philosophy of science from Oxford University as well as a doctorate in environmental science from the University of Minnesota. A serial entrepreneur, Krohn also co-founded Mighty Axe Hops and a couple of health and fitness apps, one of which counted nearly 90,000 users.\nGoswami connected with Krohn through the Medical Devices Center, which focuses on developing solutions to unmet clinical needs. Among those is snoring, which Goswami said affects almost everybody some time and habitual snorers at least three to four times a week, disrupting their sleep and their bed partners.\nThe underlying cause of snoring, Goswami said, is weak upper airway muscles. When someone who snores falls asleep, his or her upper airway muscles relax. The jaw or tongue can slide back, obstructing the airway and producing noisy vibrations during inhalation. It\u2019s on the same spectrum as sleep apnea, which occurs when the obstruction is complete or nearly so.\nThe Soundly app strengthens the user\u2019s upper airway muscles, reducing vibrations and the resulting snoring, building on a concept established in earlier studies, Goswami said.\nSoundly co-founder Adam Black, a biomedical scientist and Innovation Fellow with Krohn, used an ultrasound machine at the Medical Devices Center to find vocalizations that would target upper airway muscles. Black discovered that the \u201cnee\u201d and \u201cnaw\u201d sounds engage the muscles at the back of the throat.\nPlaying the Soundly app during the day is an easier, more engaging and less costly solution for snorers, Goswami said. Mandible devices intended to reduce snoring, he said, can cost $2,300 or more and affect sleep quality.\n\u201cBut if you\u2019re doing something during the daytime for 15 minutes a day, then when you go to sleep you get all natural sleep at that time.\u201d\nSnoring is not a medical condition, so treatments do not require approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Goswami said.\nThat will help the Soundly app get in position to make money faster while the company makes improvement and investigates other uses, said Arthur Erdman, Medical Devices Center director.\n\u201cI do think this is a perfect application,\u201d Erdman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a process that has been proven to improve snoring for certain classes of people\u201d while the game format \u201cmakes it fun and puts some motivation into it.\u201d\nJay Schrankler, associate vice president for research and head of the U\u2019s Office for Technology Commercialization, said the university typically holds an equity stake of 10 to 20 percent of companies its spins out, although he declined to specify the stake it holds in Soundly.\n\u201cI would be willing to bet this has to be one of the largest markets, period, for any medical application,\u201d Schrankler said. \u201cAbout everyone has some level of snoring. That\u2019s exciting that there\u2019s such a large potential market.\u201d"}

We had to take it through several stages and the first stage was letting go of the theatre show because it was so deeply ground into our heads,\" The League of Gentlemen's Dyson explained.\nThe main thing they had to consider was how to adapt the play's lecture-based structure for a movie, allowing them to still tell the three chilling unsolved cases that haunted professional sceptic Phillip Goodman.\n\"There are twists within the play that we haven't brought over to the film and vice-versa, some of the stuff in the film isn't in the play,\" Nyman added.\nPhoto credit: Rex Shutterstock More\n(Ghost Stories play)\n\"One of the big devices in the play is that the whole thing is presented as a lecture that Goodman is giving.

Shane Tuell told the Tulsa World. \u201cYou have a breakdown somewhere in law enforcement and a lot of people know, and a lot of people should know because of transparency. I would agree \u2026 there was a breakdown somewhere after this young man was booked in.\u201d\nA few days after Green was released due to the breakdown in communication, he allegedly went on a crime spree that ended with the death of Anderson.\n\u201cThis is a good example of how communication within an organization needs to improve,\u201d Sgt.

Contract negotiations with wide receiver Alshon Jeffery were reserved for later.\n\u201cThose things will pick up as we get further down the road,\u201d Pace told reporters in Mobile, Alabama, on Jan. 26.\n\u201cThose things\u201d will pick up starting Wednesday, the first day teams can apply the franchise tag to players. Teams have a two-week window, which ends March 1 at 3 p.m., to use their franchise-tag designation.\nBears receiver Alshon Jeffery played under the franchise tag in 2016. (AP)\nLast year, the Bears waited until the end of the window to put the tag on Jeffery after negotiations stalled at the NFL Scouting Combine. This year\u2019s tag deadline occurs on the second day of the combine.\nBeyond deciding on Jay Cutler\u2019s fate, figuring out what to do with Jeffery is the most important decision Pace faces with his roster.\nUsing the franchise tag on a player allows for more time to reach a long-term agreement. But there\u2019s no guarantee the Bears will use it on Jeffery, who turned 27 on Tuesday, again this year. The franchise tag for Jeffery is projected to be more than $17 million.\nMaking matters more interesting is that the combine is a week later this offseason. It ends March 6, a day before the league\u2019s three-day negotiation window opens. Free agency officially begins March 9 at 3 p.m.\nTurning the 2016 season into a prove-it year for Jeffery was the obvious and only solution after contract talks stalled last year.\nJeffery\u2019s camp was looking for a deal that would put him among the elite at his position \u2014 the Bengals\u2019 A.J. Green, the Falcons\u2019 Julio Jones, the Cowboys\u2019 Dez Bryant and the Broncos\u2019 Demaryius Thomas.\nBut signing Jeffery to such a deal would\u2019ve set a bad precedent for the Bears after he was limited by various soft-tissue injuries in 2015. Availability matters.\nJeffery\u2019s $14.6 million franchise tag put him second in yearly average last season for receivers, trailing only Green at $15 million.\nThe problem for negotiations this year is that Jeffery\u2019s prove-it season proved very little. Everything remains muddled.\nIf Jeffery\u2019s camp is adamant in its pursuit of an upper-echelon deal \u2014 knowing that big money can be found on the open market \u2014 common ground might be hard to find.\nJeffery\u2019s numbers in 2016 \u2014 52 catches, 821 yards and two touchdowns in 12 games \u2014 were unimpressive, though he was affected by changes at quarterback.\nStill, if the Bears move on from Cutler, can Jeffery connect with the next quarterback?\nJeffery\u2019s value increased when he was voted a captain. But his four-game suspension for violating the NFL\u2019s rules for performance-enhancing drugs soured positive vibes about his intangibles.\n\u201cI think Alshon expects more,\u201d Pace said during the Bears\u2019 season-ending news conference Jan. 4. \u201cI think he\u2019s a good player. And that\u2019s a big decision for us.\u201d\nBut how good is he really?\nIt\u2019s actually a complex question, considering that the Bears are rebuilding, that the team will have their third receivers coach in three years and that a new quarterback could be coming to town.\nThe better question might be: Do Jeffery\u2019s talents transcend change?\nHe had mixed results last season with three quarterbacks. According to Pro Football Reference, Brian Hoyer\u2019s passer rating of 83.3 when throwing to Jeffery was better than Cutler\u2019s (74.3) and Matt Barkley\u2019s (50.9).\nOn the other side, the argument can be made that the Bears desperately need Jeffery, especially with uncertainty surrounding Kevin White after his second surgery. (White and Jeffery share the same agent.)\nAll of the above will make for interesting discussions between the Bears and Jeffery in the coming weeks."}

The plan includes a higher minimum wage and better working conditions, free tuition for hundreds of thousands of students, easier access to affordable child care, and free prescription drugs for everyone under 25 through the biggest expansion of medicare in a generation.\nQuick Facts\nIn February, the unemployment rate in Ontario was 5.5 per cent, the lowest since 2000.\nThe Throne Speech builds on measures the government brought forward during the first two sessions of the 41st Parliament as part of its plan for fairness, and providing care and opportunity in a time of rapid economic change.\n\u201cI hear from people every day who put caring first \u2014 whether it\u2019s at home, caring for their families, or at work, caring for patients, students or society\u2019s most vulnerable people. The people of Ontario are our greatest strength, and our government doesn\u2019t accept that anyone should be left to fend for themselves, particularly in this turbulent, changing economy. We\u2019re taking bold steps to ensure the best care for our children, our seniors and our friends and family members. Our plan will relieve pressure on families by making it easier for people to care for themselves and for each other.\u201d, Kathleen Wynne, Premier of Ontario.\nThrone Speech\nMr. Speaker, Honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, people of Ontario:\nAs the representative of Her Majesty the Queen, it is my honour to open the third Session of the 41st Parliament by delivering the Speech from the Throne.\nI begin by acknowledging that we are gathered on the traditional territory of many Indigenous peoples, whose history on this land dates back millennia. We are filled with respect for how, with their partnership, Ontario and all of its prosperity was built. We also recognize that for generations, this wealth was not shared. Indigenous peoples have suffered under the harsh legacy of colonialism. We honour the role Indigenous peoples will continue to play as we push ahead to build and rebuild those partnerships here in Ontario.\nOntario\u2019s story is the story of its people.\nFrom the Indigenous peoples who were the first to live on this land;\nTo the descendants of the French and British settlers who sought new horizons;\nAnd the generations of newcomers who worked their way here from around the world, seeking acceptance and opportunity;\nOntario\u2019s people are its greatest strength.\nThey always have been.\nIt is their talent and skills, their foresight and compassion, that have built this province into the place we are proud to call home.\nInspired by our past, we continue to aim higher.\nJoining together, we are compelled to do more.\nWe see this spirit, this impulse to care for each other, alive in our communities every day.\nWe see it in the way people responded to the recent unprecedented flooding in Ottawa, and then again in Brantford and southwestern Ontario, filling sandbags to protect their neighbours\u2019 homes.\nWe see it in the way people volunteered at the Invictus Games last fall, coming out in large numbers to support the recovery of wounded warriors from Ontario, Canada, and around the world through spirited competition.\nAnd we see it in the way we have welcomed more than 22,000 Syrian refugees to communities in every corner of the province. From Windsor to Thunder Bay to Cornwall, we are supporting them as they start over in a new country, at new jobs and in new schools.\nTime and time again, we come together.\nWe care for our families, our neighbours and our province.\nWe see the big picture.\nWhen Ontario became a member of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, we committed to help advance education, gender equity and sustainable development across the French-speaking world.\nOntario is a special place, but there is no denying our province also faces challenges.\nEven with a relatively strong and growing economy; even with unemployment at its lowest point in nearly two decades; and even with high school graduation rates at their highest ever\u2026\nFor many of our friends and neighbours, life is getting harder.\nOur world is changing in ways we\u2019ve never seen before and at speeds that make it feel hard to keep up.\nThe cost of living is rising, and at the same time, stable, long-term jobs \u2014 jobs that pay a decent wage \u2014 are proving harder to find.\nPart-time and precarious work is becoming more common\u2026\nAnd as these pressures mount, they bear down on families where it matters most.\nPeople are struggling to take care of themselves, and their loved ones.\nA Time for Care\nGovernment hears from people every day who are carrying a great burden.\nThey share their stories in phone calls and letters and in person at town halls.\nToday\u2019s changing economy and tomorrow\u2019s uncertainty are hard realities that affect their lives and their dreams.\nIn Peterborough, a man who has been a minimum wage earner for much of his life now, wrote to say that he doesn\u2019t want anyone else to have to choose between paying a bill and buying groceries, or to experience the feeling of inward shame and failure for having to use a food bank.\nA mother who lives in Thunder Bay, where she works as a teacher, spoke about her eldest daughter, who has complex special needs. Their family is calling on government to improve access to children\u2019s services, so their daughter can continue to live close to home.\nA man in Toronto explained how his family is relying on his wife\u2019s income as a personal support worker, because he is also acting as a full-time caregiver to his mother at home \u2014 she has late-stage Alzheimer\u2019s. And they need support.\nThese are familiar stories.\nThey are the realities that so many people are facing.\nAnd so, as places around the world consider how to handle these same new realities, Ontario\u2019s answer is clear.\nWe are doing more.\nWe are not pulling back.\nWe are taking bold steps, guided by a commitment to care.\nThat is our responsibility.\nThe Foundations of Care\nCare is all around us. In the way a father walks his child to school. In the way a daughter holds her mother\u2019s hand in the doctor\u2019s office. In the way a teacher sings the alphabet. In the way a nurse shows compassion for a fearful patient. Care is who we are, and it is what we do.\nWhen government uses its resources to support caregivers and make it easier for people to care for themselves and each other, it provides for everyone what individuals would struggle to do alone: provide the best care for our children, the best care for our seniors, and the best care for the people we know who are struggling with mental and physical illness.\nWe all know someone who is in need of better care.\nWe know the stress and anxiety it causes that person, and their family.\nGovernment stands behind them.\nWe do not accept that people should fend for themselves, and see if they can make it on their own.\nThat would not be fair, not when there are things we can do to support each other.\nAs the changing economy widens the gaps in our society, your government has a plan for care and opportunity.\nAnd it builds on a solid foundation that has already been laid.\nWhen you elected your government four years ago, you gave it a mandate to improve people\u2019s retirement security, so that they could rely on a predictable source of income after a lifetime of hard work.\nYour government fought for Ontario\u2019s hard-working men and women, leading the way for an enhanced Canada Pension Plan.\nThe improved CPP will pay out more in benefits to millions of retirees across the country, providing that extra level of security and support for workers.\nAs well, for too long, professionally trained caregivers in Ontario were undervalued.\nThese kind, compassionate and skilled individuals devote their whole lives to caring for others.\nTo them, providing care is more than a job. It is a calling.\nPersonal support workers and early childhood educators are the people who provide essential care for our growing children and our aging parents.\nThey are mostly women, many are new to Canada, and the care they provide is essential.\nYour government raised their wages.\nThese targeted solutions are making a meaningful difference in a changing world.\nBut that was only the beginning.\nSince the last Session of this Parliament began, more people are getting the support they need to care for their families.\nIt begins at birth.\nNo child should have to go without the medicine they need. Now they don\u2019t have to.\nAs of January 1st in Ontario, prescription drugs are absolutely free for every person under the age of 25.\nAlready, with OHIP+, more than one million young people in Ontario have had their medical prescriptions filled at no cost to their families.\nFor those young families with children, access to child care is also critically important.\nFor mothers in particular, it means they can go back to work when they choose.\nEarlier this month, when we celebrated International Women\u2019s Day, we were reminded again that there is a long way to go to achieve gender equity.\nOnly when we eliminate those barriers to child care will we get there.\nThus far, your government has taken its first steps to make child care more accessible.\nThe waitlist fees for child care have been eliminated, and a plan to help 100,000 more families access spots in child care is well underway.\nSubsidies are available for 60 per cent of all those new spaces, because they need to be an affordable choice for families.\nWhen children in Ontario turn four, they now have access to full-day kindergarten, which provides early, high-quality education to four and five-year-olds and huge savings for their families \u2014 giving them a great start.\nBut as Ontario\u2019s youngest and brightest grew up, too many of them were hitting a wall after graduation, unable to pursue their dreams because the cost of postsecondary school was out of reach.\nOntario\u2019s education system is among the best in the world.\nWe are already home to 44 publicly funded colleges and universities.\nAnd we are moving ahead with creating the first French-language university in Ontario.\nIt wasn\u2019t fair that students were struggling to afford this higher education.\nBeginning this school year, college and university tuition is free for hundreds of thousands of students who were struggling to pay for it.\nStudents from families who earn up to $90,000 are eligible for free tuition. Students from families who earn more than $90,000 may also receive free tuition depending on their circumstances. Those from families who make up to $175,000 are also eligible for generous aid.\nToday, more than 225,000 future graduates are working towards their degrees and diplomas without worrying about the cost of tuition \u2014 including almost 13,500 single moms.\nThe number of Indigenous students receiving OSAP has increased by 34 per cent.\nIn Ontario\u2019s workforce, 1.1 million men and women are earning minimum wage.\nUntil recently, that meant $11.40 an hour. It wasn\u2019t enough. It wasn\u2019t providing families with the support they needed to care for each other.\nYour government boosted the minimum wage to $14 an hour.\nNext January, it increases again to $15 an hour.\nThis is a long-awaited raise for those 1.1 million people, and it will ensure a safer, brighter future for their families.\nFinally, seniors built this province into what it is today. They deserve the best care possible so they can live at home or in their community for as long as possible.\nYour government has committed to building 5,000 new beds over the next four years as part of a 10-year plan to create more than 30,000 new beds in the long-term care sector.\nA portion of these new beds will serve specific cultural needs, including Indigenous populations.\nBy 2022, residents in long-term care homes will also have access to 15 million more hours of care from nurses, personal support workers, and therapeutic care workers every year.\nThis will help to ensure seniors have the care they need, and their loved ones have peace of mind.\nThese investments will have ongoing benefits.\nThey are making a difference not just now, but for years and decades to come.\nThe same is true of the government\u2019s actions on climate change.\nThese are fights that our children and grandchildren can\u2019t afford for us to lose.\nOntario eliminated coal-fired power, making our air cleaner and lowering our rates of childhood asthma.\nBut you cannot be serious about lowering emissions and fighting climate change without a price on carbon pollution.\nWe joined with Quebec and California in North America\u2019s largest carbon market, because this system helps us achieve our ambitious climate change goals, at the lowest cost to people and to businesses.\nAnd every dollar raised goes to making our province more green with public transit and bike lanes, and helping families and businesses to lower their energy bills and become more energy efficient.\nAlready, Ontario\u2019s carbon market is funding energy-saving renovations at 98 hospitals, as well as at many college and university campuses, schools and in social housing units across Ontario.\nAs pollution has fallen in Ontario, our economy has grown.\nTaken together, all of these actions have helped to lay a solid foundation of care and opportunity in Ontario.\nHowever, your government recognizes it is still not enough.\nThe Courage to Care\nThe pressures Ontario families are facing are varied, and they are mounting.\nThis is having a real impact on their lives and on their ability to care for loved ones.\nGovernment cannot turn its back.\nThere is so much more to do.\nThat is why, after delivering a balanced Budget this year, your government has made a deliberate choice to make more investments in the care and the services that the people of this province rely on.\nAs a result, the 2018 Budget will show a modest deficit next year of less than one per cent of our GDP, and outline a path back to a balanced budget.\nFamilies today are struggling, and by doing more to help them with the costs of care, government can relieve some of the pressure and worry they are feeling.\nIt is the right thing to do in support of a fairer way forward.\nInvestments in care and opportunity will better enable people to care for their loved ones, and to get ahead in all aspects of their lives.\nWhen we care for each other, we can change lives.\nSo government is doing what it can, by investing in the people who make our province strong.\nIn the 2018 Budget, you will see major investments in the services you need: health care, home care, mental health and addictions, and child care.\nFirst, your government will make significant investments in the operation of our hospitals.\nThis will reduce the wait times people experience when they need care.\nThere will be major investments in home care, to provide more services for people aging at home and provide financial relief for families caring for aging loved ones.\nThe next Budget will also prioritize the growing need for mental health and addictions care in Ontario\u2026\nExpanding access to mental health care and helping to ensure people can get the support they need in our schools and our communities.\nThe cost of child care, which has long been a stumbling block for growing families, will also be addressed in the Budget.\nAt the same time, government programs that are already making it easier for you to care for your loved ones, and help them to succeed, will be expanded.\nOHIP+, the pharmacare program that is providing free medications for children and youth, will be expanded to include other parts of the population.\nMore people without a drug or dental benefits plan will have access to more affordable prescription drugs and dental care.\nAnd the free tuition program that is already making postsecondary school more affordable for those from modest backgrounds will grow.\nMore students will be able to attend college and university, tuition-free.\nMiddle-class families will not have to shoulder onerous debt to give their children the opportunities every student in Ontario deserves.\nFurthermore, investments will be made to train more apprentices, including in new, emerging fields.\nOpportunities in Ontario will grow.\nThe burdens of poverty will ease.\nBudget 2018 will lighten the load people are carrying today.\nIt will help to reduce the financial strain that is holding them back.\nThat healthier, more caring Ontario will be, without question, a stronger, more prosperous Ontario.\nThe Benefits of Putting Care First\nYour government\u2019s plan for care and opportunity is the right way forward for Ontario\u2019s people, and Ontario\u2019s economy, because the well-being of both are intrinsically linked.\nWhen more people have access to the prescription drugs and mental health supports they need to be well, they can fully participate in the community.\nWhen more sons and daughters who are caring for aging parents at home have professional support and financial relief, they can go to work every day, with more energy and confidence \u2014 and save for their own future.\nWhen more parents have access to affordable child care, they can make the choice to return to work.\nWhen more students can attain a higher education, they can push the boundaries of our knowledge and develop new ways of doing things in medicine, technology and construction.\nOur potential in Ontario is boundless, but it is not assured.\nOur potential must be supported and embraced.\nWith new investments in health care, home care, mental health and child care\u2026.in our young people\u2019s learning from preschool to postsecondary\u2026more of that potential will be unlocked.\nThis is the age of hyper-globalization. Ontario has to fight for good jobs and growth.\nIt is a fight that hinges on Ontario\u2019s people being at their best.\nPeople are, unquestionably, our number one resource.\nThey are the reason Ontario is punching above its weight in the economy of the future: artificial intelligence, clean tech, life sciences, and information and communications technologies.\nOur people are the innovators behind cutting-edge developments in agri-food and mining and forestry.\nThey are driving the future of manufacturing and they are leading the way in financial services.\nOur people are the reason businesses look to Ontario when they are growing and expanding.\nTo that end, your government will continue to advocate for Ontario abroad \u2014 standing up for our businesses and workers, including our autoworkers, steelworkers and workers in agriculture as part of our U.S. engagement strategy, and partnering with businesses at home and overseas.\nRecognizing that some parts of the province have particular struggles and challenges with achieving economic growth in this period of transition, the Budget will support regional investments and job funds.\nAcross Ontario, the government\u2019s record-breaking investments in our infrastructure will continue.\nWhen we build new roads and bridges, new transit systems, new hospitals and schools, those projects generate benefits and opportunity for workers and the entire economy.\nAll of this together is how, even amid trade uncertainty and the disruptive nature of rapid technological change, Ontario\u2019s economy will continue to grow and prosper.\nThat economic growth is how, in turn, government will invest in care and create more opportunities.\nThe 2018 Budget appreciates this full circle, and will leverage it.\nWith the results of these investments, the Budget will present a clear path to return to balance \u2014 without sacrificing the services that are the essential foundation of a fairer, better Ontario.\nBuilding a Place of Fairness, Caring and Opportunity\nSince your government was elected in 2014, Ontario\u2019s achievements have set us apart as a place of fairness, caring and opportunity.\nInspired by the people who every day are caring for their family, being active in their community and are building this province into the fair and prosperous place we call home, your government has chosen to do more.\nWith bold ideas and a balanced plan, Ontario has led the way forward in Canada.\nAn enhanced Canada Pension Plan, pharmacare for children and youth, free postsecondary tuition, fairness at work, and our joint carbon market are significant achievements.\nThey are opening new opportunities daily and providing much-needed security in a world of growing turmoil.\nBut in Ontario, we always aim higher.\nWith the 2018 Budget, Ontario will build on these investments in people and the care they need.\nWe will continue to lead the way on climate change.\nWe will not push the most pressing issue we face onto the next generation.\nWe will come together and we will do more for one another.\nThe challenges we face today may seem daunting, at times even insurmountable.\nBut if there is anywhere in the world that can figure out the best way to confront them, and emerge, fairer, stronger and more united, it is Ontario.\nIt is all of us here, all of us together.\nThank you. Merci. Meegwetch."}

That jump was the largest in nearly three years.\nSteady job gains and rising numbers of millennials moving out on their own has intensified the competition for homes. February's price gain far outpaces average increases in wages or inflation.\nAmericans are becoming reluctant to sell their homes as mortgage rates rise, preferring to renovate instead. Others are holding onto their homes because they see few other options available. That's kept supply tight: The number of homes for sale fell 7.2 percent in March from a year earlier to just 1.67 million.\nSales of existing homes ticked up in March but actually declined slightly from a year earlier as the housing shortage constrained sales.\nHomebuyers are getting increasingly aggressive, snapping up homes an average of 30 days after they are listed in March, down from 34 days a year earlier.\n\"Competition is fierce, offer windows are short and tensions will inevitably run high for many buyers as the spring shopping season unfolds,\" Svenja Gudell, chief economist at real estate data website Zillow, said.\nThere are signs that the supply crunch could ease later this year, as listings have picked up in recent months, only to be quickly sold. And developers are breaking ground on more homes, lifting single-family home construction 5.2 percent in March compared with a year earlier.\nSeattle, Las Vegas and San Francisco remain the nation's top real estate hot spots, with home prices jumping 12.7 percent in Seattle, 11.6 percent in Las Vegas and 10.1 percent in San Francisco.\nStrong job gains in some cities, which hint at an influx of new residents, are pushing up home prices, Standard & Poor's said. Seattle reported the biggest increase in employment, and had the largest home price gain. Chicago ranked 19th out of the 20 cities tracked in both home price increases and employment. Cleveland came in at 18th place in home prices and 20th in employment.\nBut in San Francisco and Los Angeles, home prices are rising much faster than their job gains would suggest, a sign that regulatory limits on homebuilding and limited land availability are pushing prices eve higher.\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Photo credit: MikeDotta Shutterstock CNA\nDenver, Colo., Dec 10, 2017 CNA\/EWTN News.- This week, TIME Magazine announced a group of women and men as their collective Person of the Year.\nWhat do these people have in common? They are what TIME called \u201cThe Silence Breakers\u201d - people who have blown the whistle on sexual assault and abuse within the workplace, largely in the industries of film, politics, and media.\nIn recent months an avalanche of abuse allegations have been brought to light against powerful figures, starting most notably with a piece in the New York Times in which several women accused Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault. This sparked a flood of men and women coming forward with other allegations of abuse against numerous people in positions of power.\n\u201cThese silence breakers have started a revolution of refusal, gathering strength by the day, and in the past two months alone, their collective anger has spurred immediate and shocking results: nearly every day, CEOs have been fired, moguls toppled, icons disgraced. In some cases, criminal charges have been brought,\u201d TIME reported.\nNot long ago, the Catholic Church in the United States was reeling from its own sex abuse crisis. In the early 2000s, reporters at the Boston Globe broke the story of a former priest who was accused of molesting more than 100 boys over 30 years, which led to a large-scale uncovering of thousands more allegations of abuse in dioceses throughout the country.\nSince then, the Church has taken care to provide numerous resources to such victims, and develop robust child protection policies.\nEdward Mechmann, director of public policy and the safe environment office for the Archdiocese of New York, told CNA that the \u201csilence breakers\u201d who came forward and continue to come forward with accusations of abuse by clergy and Church personnel are key in maintaining a safe environment in the Church.\n\u201cI think the one thing we have to make sure we understand is who the whistleblowers are, and for the most part, the whistleblowers are victims,\u201d Mechmann said.\n\u201cAs much as the outside observers like the Boston Globe and the media in general contributed to our awareness of the scope of the problem, we would really be nowhere unless we had some of these courageous victims coming forward, because without them, we would have many more men in service who are victimizers,\u201d he added.\nIt is especially important that victims come forward in order to protect others from abuse, he noted, because in some cases, abusers have victimized numerous people over the span many years.\nRecently, the Church has seen victims coming forward \u201cmuch more willingly now, because they see that we\u2019re serious, they see that we\u2019re not going to victimize them again, and they see concrete results\u201d such as accused persons being removed from ministry, he said.\n\u201cThe first and most important thing we do is we listen to them, and I can\u2019t tell you how important that is,\u201d Mechmann said.\n\u201cSo many people that come in to see us are afraid, they\u2019ve been victimized, they\u2019re afraid they\u2019re going to be victimized again, and just the fact that we listen to them is just an enormously healing thing,\u201d he said.\nBesides listening to victims, Mechmann said the Church also provides support through counseling and through talking with victims about the Church\u2019s internal processes for dealing with cases of abuse.\n\u201cAnd we stay in contact with them, if they want to stay in contact with us, we walk with them,\u201d he added.\nDr. Benjamin Keyes, a Catholic psychologist and Director for the Center for Trauma and Resiliency Studies at Divine Mercy University, told CNA that supporting and encouraging victims who come forward is of the utmost importance.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole lot of relief that someone has finally heard the story...they\u2019re no longer isolated with the information, and how well they fare afterwards really depends on what happens around them,\u201d he said. \u201cAre they supported, are there people in their network, whether it's family, friends, or co-workers, that really understand and really support them in the courage that it takes to do this?\u201d\nSometimes it can takes months or even years for victims of abuse to break the silence on what happened to them, Keyes said, because there is usually \u201ca lot of embarrassment, a lot of shame involved, and most people, women in particular, don\u2019t want to expose that to the public or to others, even to those who are close to (them),\u201d he said.\nThe fear of retaliation or retribution is also something that can keep victims from coming forward, especially if the abuse came from someone who is in a position of power over the victim, Keyes noted.\nFor these reasons, victims need encouragement and support from the Church in order to feel comfortable coming forward.\n\u201cThe Church can be supportive, especially in the parishes, (by) making it safe for (whistleblowers) to be who they are, by acknowledging the courage that it took for them to do that, and to be supportive vocally within the body of the Church so that people hear that the Church is supporting it,\u201d he said.\nSupporting victims also involves \u201cmaking sure that they stay networked into not only the activities that they\u2019ve been involved with, but that they stay networked into the body of the Church, so that they don\u2019t walk away,\u201d he added.\nThe parish priest, as well as members of the parish community, are especially key in making victims feel welcomed and supported, he noted, which can be done simply by including them and befriending them.\n\u201cWe\u2019re taught in the Bible to love and to love unconditionally, and this is part of that,\u201d Keyes said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s embracing the broken places and binding up the suffering and reaching out to the broken-hearted, and we\u2019re called as Christians, not just as counselors, to do that,\u201d he added.\nSince the sex abuse crisis in the Church in the United States, the bishops have put into place numerous policies and practices to protect victims, and especially children from sexual abuse, including the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops' Charter for Child and Youth Protection, which calls for an annual audit and report of all the dioceses in the country.\nThe Church has also implemented safe environment trainings that call for a zero-tolerance policy of abuse in Church environments.\n\u201cI think a lot of what\u2019s happening is really good,\u201d Mechmann said, regarding the silence breakers in media and politics who have recently come forward.\n\u201cMaybe the world as a whole could learn a little bit from the way that we have handled this, in terms of creating a clear corporate culture of zero tolerance.

The local nonprofit provides social and recreational programs for children and families suffering from cancer and life-threatening illnesses.\nBowersock says a source of his inspiration is \"Bartenders Giving Back\" \u00ad\u2014 an initiative he hopes to spread throughout the Roaring Fork Valley \u2014 and how a few of his bartending friends in Aspen responded to the April 2015 earthquake that devastated Nepal.\nBartenders at Justice Snow's led a fundraising effort, in part using the tips they earned, for a nonprofit helping rebuild homes in Nepal. Two of the bartenders traveled to Nepal to build the longhouses, which Bowersock thought was \"wild.\"\nInspired and motivated by their commitment to help people, Bowersock was bartending at Hop's Culture at the time and walked over to Justice Snow's one night after work. He asked who was managing the fundraiser and donated every penny he earned in tips that day \u2014 $233 and change \u00ad\u2014 to the cause.\nRecommended Stories For You\n\"He looked up at me and said, 'You just funded a longhouse that could house six to 10 people,'\" Bowersock recalled. \"I thought that was one of the coolest things.\"\nFrom then on, Bowersock was sold.\nAnd while he recognizes that bartending in a ski town isn't the most lucrative or \"financially secure\" of occupations, it's a sacrifice he is happy to make.\n\"I always believe in helping others or people who really need it, and if that means giving up some of the other luxuries of life, I'm fine with that,\" Bowersock said. \"At least that's my mentality toward that.\"\nSince the beginning of this year, Bowersock has donated more than $1,000 to nonprofits and causes. In January, it was $100 to benefit Protect Our Winters; from February to March, he gave $1,080 to the Children's Hospital Colorado in Denver.\nBowersock's latest mission is to help the Shining Stars Foundation. The philanthropist said he chose the local nonprofit to benefit because \"we've all been afflicted by cancer.\"\n\"Whether it be your mom, dad, brother, sister, friend,\" he said, \"I feel like everybody's been touched by cancer in one shape or form.\"\nBowersock, whose last shift of the season tending bar at the Chef's Club was Thursday, has raised $3,100 for the organization since late June.\nShining Stars director of development Megan Bryant said the foundation is \"blown away\" by Bowersock's ambition and dedication.\n\"Every time I talk to him he's off to the next job. It means so much and it does have a huge impact,\" Bryant said, noting that the foundation is small and therefore every dollar helps.\n\"He's giving this money out of his pocket, and he works his butt off. It's very humbling, when people do something like that, giving when it's not easy,\" she said. \"And do it so joyfully like he does, he just does it with so much enthusiasm.\"\nBowersock, who vowed to shave his head should he meet his goal, has no plans of slowing down.\n\"I think right now, in particular, Puerto Rico could use some help,\" he said. \"Wounded Warriors to help out veterans, and I would like to do something to help out with the refugee crisis.\"\nAlong with his last shift behind the bar, Bowersock's final effort to reach his $5,000 pledge to Shining Stars will take place at Hooch Craft Cocktail Bar on Oct. 23. From 7 p.m. to midnight, 100 percent of the bar's sales and gratuity will benefit Shining Stars.\n\"This is not something that's going to end anytime soon,\" Bowersock said. \"I'm going to keep on trying to help those who need help.\"\nerobbie@aspentimes.com"}

The report said that the three early raiser rivers such as Kabul, Jhelum and Chenab will help fill the crop requirement for the remaining season.\nThe report based on the water availability situation of the past 17-18 years from 1999 to December 20, 2016, says that previously the shortages in Rabi season vary from 49 percent (maximum) to five percent (minimum) and the shortage of 17 percent unprecedented. During the years in review, the country faced highest water shortage in 2001-02 when the shortage, during Rabi season, reached to 49 percent. Similarly, during the Rabi season of 2010-11, there was minimum water shortage which was five percent.\nThe Water Accord 1991 empowered the IRSA to determine water availability in the country and provincial share twice a year, once for Kharif season and the other for RABI season. Rabi season starts from October 1 while Kharif starts from April 1. The IRSA has anticipated that during current Rabi season the provinces will face 17 percent water shortage.\nAs per the anticipated water availability situation, the rivers flows were three percent less than the anticipated water situation. The IRSA has anticipated 10.06 million acre feet (Maf) flows in Indus, Kabul, Jhelum and Chenab. In Indus, the flows were three percent higher and it has received 5.24 Maf of water against the anticipated 5.10 Maf. However flows in Kabul were five percent less and received 1.54 Maf water against the anticipated 1.62 Maf, Jhelum flows were 13 percent less and it has received 1.36 Maf water against the anticipated 1.57 Maf water, while Chenab has received six percent less water and the flows were 1.66 Maf against the anticipated 1.77 Maf.\nPresently, provinces have reduced their indents because of annual canal closure (December 26 to January 26, 2017). Punjab indent is 23,200 cusecs, Sindh 10,000 cusecs, Balochistan 2,600 cusecs, and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa 3100 cusecs. The reservoirs outflows are less than its inflows, in Tarbela reservoir, the inflows are 18,200 cusecs against the outflows of 12000 cusecs and in Mangla, the inflows are 5332 cusecs against the outflows of 10,000 cusecs.\nAs per the report, the rivers inflows are lightly less than the anticipated flows, however, the losses anticipated at the start of the season were 1.17 Maf but the actual loss remained at 0.43 Maf. About 0.8 Maf water was saved on account of losses, the report said.\nSo far provinces received five percent extra water in their canals with respect to allocation and received 17.91 Maf water against the anticipated 17.04 Maf. It is hoped that all the provincial targets of wheat crop have been achieved, except for Barrani Area which is dependent on rainfall, the report added.\nFrom October 1st to December 20th, Punjab received four percent extra water and withdrew 9.71 Maf water against the anticipated allocations of 9.31 Maf, Sindh withdrew seven percent extra water and received 7.24 Maf water against the anticipated allocation of 6.75 Maf, Balochistan withdrew three percent less water and received 0.60 Maf against the anticipated 0.62 allocations while KP received its full share of 0.36 Maf, the report said.\nAccording to the operation statement of IRSA at the start of season \u2013 by December 20th \u2013 Tarbela and Mangla reservoirs level were anticipated at 1413 feet (dead level is 1380 feet) and 1099 feet (dead level 1040), however, they stood at 1418 and 1103 feet respectively.\nRegarding the weather outlook for the current month, the report said that as per the international weather forecast rainfall is expected in the next week hopefully from Wednesday evening to Friday evening. The rain may cover Jammu in Indian Occupied Kashmir, Muzaffarabad, Abbottabad, and Islamabad up to Lahore."}

(April 23, 2018) \u2013 Race Notes\nThe 2018 Honda Indy Grand Prix of Alabama became an event that spanned two days, beginning in rainy conditions on Sunday afternoon and finishing in the same vein a day later. On strategies that favored the race staying dry, Ed Carpenter Racing drivers Jordan King and Spencer Pigot did not have luck on their side today. King finished the timed event in the 14th position and Pigot took the checkered flag in 15th.\nAs anticipated, rains arrived prior to yesterday\u2019s pre-race ceremonies at Barber Motorsports Park. By the time the race started, heavy rain was falling and the race was declared a wet start, requiring all competitors to start on wet condition Firestone Firehawk tires. After one lap under caution, the green flag flew on Lap 2. King, from England, grew up racing in the rain and wasted no time in moving up through the field. In the first lap alone, he gained four positions. Though Pigot lost two positions, he made them up immediately, before the conclusion of the next lap.\nWhen the stopped car of Charlie Kimball brought out the first yellow on Lap 12, King was already up to 13th while Pigot was 15th. On the Lap 17 restart, Will Power spun and made contact with the wall. From there, driver visibility was too compromised and a red flag condition began. When officials decided to suspend the race until today, King had gained eight positions to run 11th and Pigot was up five to 12th.\nThe race resumed just after the noon hour today with 23 laps completed and approximately 75 minutes remaining. Now a dry start, King passed two cars before Turn 2 and moved into the Top 10. By the fourth green flag lap, King began battling technical issues. A suspected after effect of yesterday\u2019s rain, the timing stand for the No. 20 Fuzzy\u2019s Vodka engineering staff was left briefly without telemetry, while King lost all information on the dash of his steering wheel. While the timing stand came back up quickly, King did not regain information on his dash until the latter portion of the race. He fell to 12th but managed to not to pit until his first scheduled stop.\nWhile Pigot was making his way around the lapped car of Zachary Claman De Melo on Lap 27, the two made contact and became entangled at speed. Both managed to continue, though Pigot dropped from 12th to 17th. The No. 21 Fuzzy\u2019s Vodka crew readied spare suspension pieces in the event repairs were needed. However, when Pigot made his first stop on Lap 37, the crew looked over the car and deemed there was no damage. No longer needing to save fuel, Pigot was given the go-ahead to make maximum lap time and began working to regain the positions he had lost.\nWith the field on split strategies, King and Pigot cycled toward the Top 10. The pair of 24-year-olds were running 10th and 11th, respectively, when Pigot made his second stop on Lap 57. King moved all the way up to the sixth position prior to pitting on Lap 67. With the combination of their strategies and a dry race track, both were looking at the potential of securing their first Top 10 finishes of the season.\nHowever, heavy rains came to the 2.3-mile permanent road course for the second day in a row. Hoping for a late race caution that would have the event end under yellow, King and Pigot stayed on slicks as long as possible. King had to pit on the 75th of the 82 laps completed in the two-hour time limit. With only five minutes left in the race, Pigot had to come in as well for wet condition tires after spinning on Lap 77. King would finish the race in 14th while Pigot would take the checkered flag in 15th.\nEd Carpenter Racing will be back on track next week for testing at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway oval with Pigot in his No. 21, No. 20 oval driver and team owner Ed Carpenter in the No. 20, and their Indianapolis 500 teammate Danica Patrick in the No. 13 GoDaddy Chevrolet. Pigot and King\u2019s next race will be the INDYCAR Grand Prix at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course on May 12 .\nJORDAN KING, No. 20 Fuzzy\u2019s Vodka Chevrolet, Finished 14th: \u201cToday, I had a really good restart. I did exactly what I wanted to do, I wanted to dispatch a couple of cars quite quickly. I managed to get past both Ed (Jones) and Scott (Dixon) before Turn 2, so that was really good actually. That gave me good track position, we were then in the Top 5. Unfortunately, the rain yesterday may have caused an electrical problem that took quite a while to clear. Once we got going, it was then alright. Our strategy was then compromised with the rain and we were caught out. Overall slightly annoying, we really would have been fine for a Top 5 finish quite comfortably I think.\u201d\nSPENCER PIGOT, No. 21 Fuzzy\u2019s Vodka Chevrolet, Finished 15th: \u201cIt was definitely a difficult race out there. We thought we were making up some ground by pitting early and running hard, which seemed to be working. We tried to gamble at the end to stay on slicks. We were hoping for a yellow that the race would end under and we could stay up where we were. Unfortunately, that didn\u2019t happen and I just tried to keep it on the road the best I could. Eventually, it just got too wet and we had to come in at the end. There are some positives to take away from this weekend, we\u2019re going to take those into the INDYCAR Grand Prix and hopefully be back up front!\u201d"}

We suffered a lot in the first half because we didn't make those passes together.\"\nWhile the defensive frailties of both sides were regularly exposed, they also demonstrated their attacking brilliance in spells.\nPep Guardiola's first season in England has not been an unqualified success, but he has succeeded in giving City one of the Premier League's sleekest attacks, and Arsenal's equaliser spurred the visitors back to life.\nAguero restored City's lead two minutes later after being picked out by David Silva before finishing with aplomb.\nArsenal defender Mustafi again restored parity eight minutes after the break when he rose above Nicolas Otamendi to head Mesut Ozil's corner past keeper Willy Caballero with City's defence static.\n\"The test was mental,\" Wenger told Sky Sports. \"We had to come back after half time and we got a point after a time that has been so stressful for us.\"\nThe draw takes City, who visit Chelsea on Wednesday, on to 58 points, five clear of fifth-placed Manchester United, who have a game in hand, and a point behind Liverpool, who have played a game more than Pep Guardiola's side.\nArsenal, in sixth, now have 51 points and are in danger of missing out on a top-four finish for the first time since 1996. They will bid to end a three-game winless streak in the Premier League when they host West Ham United on Wednesday.\n(Reporting by Ed Dove; Editing by Ken Ferris and Clare Lovell)"}

The Jaguars defeated Gardner-Edgerton and Rockhurst Blue, and lost to Olathe Northwest, Hogan Prep and Rockhurst White in pool play.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t play the best that we could, but we played better than I thought we would,\u201d Kaifes said. \u201cI think we need to work on our chemistry together since they football players haven\u2019t been around.\u201d\nThe Mill Valley shooting guard believes that the Jaguars\u2019 chemistry will develop over the course of the summer and fall, but it hasn\u2019t been easy for them despite returning a wealth of experience from last year\u2019s varsity squad. Returning varsity players Ike Valencia, Tanner Moore, Logan Talley and Brody Flaming had a quick turnaround for the KAMO Shootout after competing at Tulsa\u2019s Philip Montgomery Football Team Camp on Tuesday through Thursday.\nMill Valley basketball coach Mike Bennett has been very appreciative from the commitment he\u2019s received from all of the Jaguar dual-sport athletes.\n\u201cHonestly, I just say thank you because it\u2019s not easy. (At the Tulsa camp), they had two sessions on Tuesday, three sessions on Wednesday, two sessions on Thursday and then come in and play games on Friday and Saturday, it\u2019s tough,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cWe share a lot of kids, and we\u2019ve just got to continue to have balance and try to work together. Those kids come in every time they get a chance to come in and work, so I appreciate it.\u201d\nAlthough Bennett said that the Jaguars \u201chaven\u2019t been real sharp\u201d after they wrapped up pool play on Saturday, one of his goals early on in the summer has been for them to develop a team identity. The Jaguars got a little taste of that when they started working on a man-press defense during their team camp two weeks ago, and Kaifes is looking forward to building on that.\n\u201cTeam camp went really well. Everyone was working really hard the whole time,\u201d Kaifes said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start man-pressing the whole game full court. We haven\u2019t really worked on it that much, so we didn\u2019t implement it this weekend.\u201d\nThe Jaguars\u2019 defense was one of the main areas that Bennett said needed to be improved following their five games of pool play. As the Jaguars spend more time on the court together and Kaifes continues to return to form, Bennett is confident that things will start to come together.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have him for 11 games and it\u2019s great to have him back,\u201d said Bennett of Kaifes. \u201cHe brings some calm to our team a little bit. Our kids kind of respond when he\u2019s in the game, and play a little bit calmer.\u201d\nSMNW, SJA players get chance to step up\nShawnee Mission Northwest senior C.C. Ghilardi was able to sympathize with the Mill Valley dual-sport athletes over the weekend as well. The SM Northwest guard split his time Friday, Saturday and Sunday between the KAMO Shootout and the Watson Challenge at Milburn Country Club in Topeka.\nGhilardi placed 29th in the tournament hosted by golfing great and Kansas City, Mo., native Tom Watson, and guided the young Cougar squad to a record of 2-5 in the KAMO Shootout. The Cougars defeated Gardner-Edgerton to begin pool play before falling to Rockhurst White, Hogan Prep, Oak Park and Olathe Northwest. They returned to action Sunday to upend Bolivar and tumble to Ozark in the lower varsity championship bracket.\nNorthwest coach Mike Rose knows what to expect from Ghilardi with him having two years of varsity experience under his belt, so he was more curious to see how some of his other players would respond to the high level of competition over the weekend.\n\u201cWe have a crew put together this weekend of some guys that have never played at this level. We\u2019ve got some of our older guys who aren\u2019t here this weekend, so we\u2019ve kind of mixed and matched a little bit to get some guys out here to play so we can see what they can do,\u201d Rose said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to take this and look at some kids and determine what we need to do during the summer to get them ready for next season and see who is ready to play at that level and who\u2019s not. In the summertime, you don\u2019t worry much about wins and losses. You just try to get the kids to understand your offensive sets and what we\u2019re looking for.\u201d\nAlong with Ghilardi, a few of the players who stood out to Rose included guards Dale Talley and Quentin Hoyle and forwards Dylan Brunner and Luke Towler.\n\u201cDale Talley is a kid who is going to play a lot for us this year, so we\u2019re getting him as many minutes as we can against those kids. We\u2019ve seen bits and pieces,\u201d Rose said. \u201cI really like what Dylan Brunner and Luke Towler are doing. Those two are going to be working for us in the paint this year as bigs.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of work to do with them, but we\u2019ve seen some good things. A couple of other kids have done some nice things for us throughout the weekend. I think Quentin Hoyle played pretty well tonight, too.\u201d\nSt. James Academy\u2019s boys basketball team also posted a record of 2-5 over the course of the three-day tournament. The Thunder defeated SM South in their final game of pool play after losing to Rolla, Olathe East, Lee\u2019s Summit North and Topeka Hayden. St. James went 1-1 in the lower varsity bracket on Sunday after beating Belton and falling to Blue Valley North.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so hard because you\u2019re playing five-in, five-out and the clock doesn\u2019t,\u201d St. James coach Stan Dohm said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had good moments and bad, and that\u2019s what summer basketball is about. We\u2019re just trying to figure out how we\u2019re going to be for next year.\u201d\nDohm is looking to replace a talented senior class that included three college signees in Zach Thornhill (Omaha), Will McKee (Washburn) and Kyle Dekraai (Avila) as well as Spencer Kaifes and Zach Allinder.\nThe Thunder will still have key pieces returning in senior center Keenan Fitzmorris and the guard combo of Josh Spradlin and David Hornung, but Dohm will be counting on the likes of Reed Wilkinson, Casey Worley, Jake Dunsmore and Jack Moellers to log more varsity minutes.\n\u201cWe graduated a lot. It exposes a lot of guys who we are hoping to have ready for varsity and a high level,\u201d Dohm said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to teach them some new things.\u201d"}

Being the market leader on the online service side \u2014 which only accounts for 6% of the industry, Matrimony.com sees that with internet penetration fast expanding into semi-urban and rural areas, there is going to be exponential growth in the online format. To increase its share further, the company will add more services and formats to its offerings to be a comprehensive player, apart from expanding its footprint nationally in a big way, says Matrimony.com founder and CEO Murugavel Janakiraman in an interview with FE\u2019s R Ravichandran. Excerpts:\nWhat has been the size and growth of the wedding industry and online matrimonial industry in India over the last five years (both volume and value)?\nThe wedding services industry is worth about $56 billion. As per market reports, the matchmaking and wedding industry has been growing steadily between 25% and 30% every year. About 10 to 12 million marriages are taking place annually in India and with only 6% of the market going online to find a life partner, there is a huge opportunity for matchmaking services.\nThe changing dynamics of the wedding business over the years and its impact on the prospective customers?\nThe wedding services industry is largely unorganised and that presents a good opportunity for an organised player like Matrimony.com. Some years ago, consumers struggled to find quality wedding services, be it wedding photography, discovering reliable mandaps online and more. Today they have MatrimonyPhotography, MatrimonyMandaps, MatrimonyBazaar from a trusted brand like BharatMatrimony. The consumer today has trusted, reliable and quality wedding services to choose from.\nHow has your journey been till now, and what are the challenges you have been facing?\nWe started as a community site in 1997 and today Matrimony.com has gone on to be publicly listed in the stock exchange in 2017. The journey to become India\u2019s largest and most trusted matrimony service has been good and fulfilling. We are quite excited about the journey ahead. Only 6% of those looking for a match are online, but with the internet fast expanding in India, the numbers are expected to grow for both matchmaking and wedding services. Where do you stand in the industry, including market share, among other aspects? We\u2019ve been a pioneer in online matchmaking and Matrimony.com is the market leader with a 60% share in online matchmaking. Nearly 3.72 million profiles were added in FY18.\nHow did you perform in the just-ended fiscal 2018 and where do you see yourself in terms of growth (volume and value)?\nMatrimony.com\u2019s consolidated PAT for the fiscal 2018 was up by 72% at Rs 74 crore. The company has achieved a consolidated revenue of Rs 335.54 crore for the year. There were 745,000 paid subscribers during 2017-18 and 108,000 success stories were reported during the year. We believe that the actual number of success stories would be much higher.\nWhat are the expansion plans of Matrimony.com, if any?\nLooking at the $56-billion wedding services market that is largely unorganised, we will continue to expand our wedding photography and videography service, MatrimonyPhotography, wedding venue discovery platform, MatrimonyMandaps and assisted service MatrimonyBazaar to other regions.\nWhat are the new marriage services of Matrimony.com and what is the market potential?\nAs I said earlier, the wedding services industry is huge. However, the majority of the categories of marriage services in India are unorganised and highly fragmented, presenting a potential opportunity for an organised aggregator like Matrimony.com to provide these services. In this regard, we have leveraged our brands, user activity on our platforms and our online matchmaking client base to diversify into marriage services to take advantage of the lack of organised services in this fragmented market.\nMatrimonyPhotography.com provides professional photography and videography services in the south. MatrimonyMandaps.com, a wedding venue discovery platform, helps customers find the right venue for their wedding. MatrimonyBazaar.com helps customers in availing wedding-related services such as wedding apparel, venue, stage decorations, photography, make-up, catering and honeymoon packages from various vendors to meet customers\u2019 wedding needs. Customers have to subscribe to the service. The company then assists the member with a relationship manager who suggests services to them based on their needs and budget.\nYour comments on the fast-growing personalised matchmaking services like EliteMatrimony and Assisted Matrimony?\nThere is a large market in India for personalised matchmaking services. Pioneered in 2008, EliteMatrimony is an exclusive matchmaking service for the rich and affluent. It\u2019s a discreet and confidential service offered by trained relationship managers who handpick matches based on status and lifestyle of members, and also facilitate meetings with prospective partners. It has India\u2019s largest database of elite profiles. Our assisted service too is doing well."}

I have answered 127 questions in the accountability court\u201d.\nTo a question why the case was framed against her, she said, \u201cDespite not figuring anywhere in the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment of April 20, 2017, the reason I was dragged into the case finds its origin in \u2018will teach a lesson\u2019 mindset that has threatened, harassed and victimised those who refuse to accept the excesses, have the courage to rise against injustice and have challenged the rotten, entrenched practice of bringing the elected prime ministers to their knees, on one pretext or the other, be it religion, corruption or even \u2018ghaddari\u2019 allegations.\u201d\nShe said: \u201cThey are defiled, disgraced, harassed and pressurised into submission if they attempt to exercise the authority conferred upon them by the Constitution.\u201d The answer is what Maryam added to her earlier prepared reply.\nSpeaking in Urdu, she said she knew why this corruption reference was being initiated against her. She said it was just to pressurise her father who has refused to the dictates.\n\u201cMy implication in this case is prompted by a mala fide intention and extraneous consideration. Indeed, I have been falsely involved on account of my commitment to the political cause of true democracy, rule of law and the Constitution and for siding with my father who has to his credit excellent performance in terms of public welfare and wellbeing of the nation at the expense of illegal incarceration and exile for a number of years on account of political victimisation,\u201d she said.\nShe questioned why she was facing this case and why she had to appear again and again before a joint investigation team (JIT) that was framed through WhatsApp calls.\n\u201cI appeared before this court more than 70 times and still this is going on. I know why I am being kept away from my mother who is suffering from the fatal disease of cancer and I also know that in the 70 years history of Pakistan no woman ever appeared before the court so many times. \u201cMy only crime is that I am the daughter of Nawaz Sharif, but just like brave and proud daughters of Pakistan, I am standing firm by my father. I am standing by his narrative. To put my father\u2019s love for me to a test, the perpetrators have involved me in this case,\u201d she said.\nMaryam said Nawaz Sharif was the one who refused to surrender before any kind of hardships, refused to resign when guns were aimed at him, rejected the world\u2019s pressure and made Pakistan a nuclear power and bravely suffered every kind of atrocities being meted out to him by former military ruler Pervez Musharraf. She said the perpetrators knew that when a case was framed against his daughter and she was dragged into the court, a traditional father would succumb to pressure and agree to their terms and conditions.\n\u201cThe people who think like this neither know Nawaz Sharif nor do they know his daughter. My father has taken up the flag against the 70-year diseases faced by this country. He is struggling for the welfare of the people of Pakistan and to protect their right to vote and democracy,\u201d she said.\nMaryam said: \u201cAs per our traditions, daughters are being respected alike, but the perpetrators deviated from these traditions of ours.

As we pull things down from shelves and out of closets, we\u2019re thinking to ourselves, do we really need all this crap?\nMoving makes me a bit crazy. There always comes a breaking point when I want to say \u201cf*ck it\u201d and get rid of everything that doesn\u2019t fit into a suitcase. Who needs possessions anyway? Isn\u2019t love all we need?\nThere are plenty of books, blogs, and think pieces dedicated to the concept of minimalism. Once a nifty design trend, it has become a full-blown spiritual philosophy based on the idea that having less stuff makes you a better person.\nMinimalism is bullshit. It\u2019s completely unattainable, and it won\u2019t always lead to spiritual enlightenment. Plus, as Chelsea Fagan points out in the Financial Diet, it also has classist and sexist undertones. She uses the example of the \u2018curated simplicity\u2019 of the ultra-rich, \u201ctheir clean loft spaces, their designer capsule wardrobes, their elaborately-reduced diets. These people are still conspicuously consuming in mind-boggling ways, they\u2019re just filtering it through the convenient prism of simplicity, and that allows their million-dollar wardrobes to somehow be aspirational for someone advocating for \u2018minimalism.\u2019\u201d\nDoes this ring any bells, Silicon Valley?\nAs with many things in life, it\u2019s about moderation. Yes, there\u2019s probably some things in your home you could stand to get rid of, but you don\u2019t have to purge your apartment of everything that won\u2019t fit conveniently into three moving boxes just to say you\u2019re doing it right. Here are common sense tips for decluttering your life:\nDo Listen to the Pros\nFor every crappy advice column about minimalism, there\u2019s an equally good professional giving real advice. Blogs like Budget Dumpster and The Spruce have really extensive guides to decluttering your home room by room, with advice from professional organizers. (Yes, that\u2019s a thing.) This piece on Apartment Therapy gives tips on what not to do when organizing. It\u2019s a great reminder that perfection shouldn\u2019t be the goal. Real life doesn\u2019t look like a Container Store catalog.\nDo find a balance that works for you\nThis isn\u2019t an excuse to hold onto everything, but do consider what is excessive, what is reasonable and within your means. You don\u2019t have to completely eliminate, it\u2019s okay to just scale back. Everyone\u2019s needs are different, and it\u2019s okay to take up space. You\u2019re allowed that as a person.\nDo rent or borrow\nThe 80\/20 rule states that we typically use 20 percent of what we own 80 percent of the time. As for the other 80 percent of our belongings, some of it is more cost effective to own even if you only use it seasonally. I hate the strict rule of getting rid of anything you haven\u2019t used in six months. I haven\u2019t used my inflatable two-person raft with attached cooler since last Independence Day, but you better believe I\u2019m not getting rid of that thing. However, there are tons of resources for you to rent or borrow things you only need on special occasions, from camping equipment to handbags and formal wear.\nDon\u2019t feel bad about throwing things away\nBritish makeup artist Wayne Goss posted a video a while ago about hoarding makeup. The story he tells about growing up poor and how that affected his perspective on \u2018having nice things\u2019 is very relatable. But he also makes an excellent point about only keeping what you need, and how relieving it felt to finally get rid of the excessive products he was keeping, but not using.\nThings in good condition can be donated to organizations that will find good homes for them. Goodwill will take just about anything from clothes to used DVD players. The Princess Project will take your old prom dresses and accessories and give them to girls in need. Books can be sold to Recycle Bookstore or donated to the Friends of San Jose Public Library. Craigslist is a great way to get rid of just about anything, from unneeded furniture to cameras and scrap fabric."}

It did not admit wrongdoing as part of Healey's settlement.\nInsys has found itself at the center of investigations focused on Subsys, an under-the-tongue spray intended for cancer patients that contains fentanyl, a highly addictive synthetic opioid.\nThose probes have come amid a national opioid abuse epidemic. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says opioids were involved in over 33,000 deaths in 2015. The death rate has continued to rise, according to estimates.\nIn December, federal prosecutors in Boston charged six former Insys executives and managers, including ex-Chief Executive Michael Babich, with engaging in a scheme to bribe doctors to prescribe Subsys and defraud insurers.\nAll six have pleaded not guilty.\nFederal charges have also been filed in several other states against other ex-Insys employees and medical practitioners who prescribed Subsys.\nInsys has said it is working toward a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department and has taken steps to strengthen its compliance program amid probes related to former employees.\nIt previously has paid $8.95 million to resolve investigations by attorneys general in Oregon, New Hampshire and Illinois, and is facing a lawsuit by Arizona.

Could it be that in the future government would have to be honest?\nClaims local governments are specifying risks in lawsuits, but not bond disclosures\nBY: Todd Shepherd, Washington Free Beacon, 2\/2\/18\nA free-market think tank is asking the Securities and Exchange Commission for an investigation into possible bond fraud by local and municipal governments that claim they will be harmed by climate change.\nThe Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) says a number of municipalities, most of them in California, are suing oil and gas companies for future damages because of climate change, and in doing so are often explicit in their forecasts of predicted sea-level rise and monetary damages.\nHowever, when those same cities sell bonds to investors, they\u2019re being far more generic in their claims of future catastrophe.\n\u201cIn their suits against oil and gas companies, California\u2019s cities and counties claim that there are clear risks from manmade climate change,\u201d CEI\u2019s General Counsel Sam Kazman said in a statement. \u201cBut when it comes to selling their municipal bonds to the public, they say just the opposite. This is hypocritical double-talk, and it may well violate federal law against securities fraud.\u201d\nCEI cites a lawsuit against oil and gas giants including BP, Chevron, and Exxon in which the City of San Francisco claims they are expecting short-term costs of $500 million, and long-term costs of $5 billion as a result of climate change.\nSan Francisco\u2019s attorneys argue that, \u201cBy 2050, for example, a \u2018100-year flood\u2019 in San Francisco is expected to occur on average once every year, and by 2100 to occur 92 times per year\u2014or almost twice per week.\u201d\nThe sea level increase caused by climate change \u201cthreatens the safety and lives of San Francisco residents,\u201d according to the suit.\nHowever, in a bond offering from earlier this year the city stated, \u201cThe City is unable to predict whether sea-level rise or other impacts of climate change or flooding from a major storm will occur, when they may occur, and if any such events occur, whether they will have a material adverse effect on the business operations or financial condition of the City and the local economy.\u201d\nPotential damages to the city could harm the city\u2019s ability to repay the bonds, which might affect a person\u2019s willingness to invest.\n\u201cInvestors across the country have relied upon the statements by these municipalities in choosing to invest in their bonds. They deserve accurate information as to the potential risks of their investments,\u201d CEI wrote in a letter to the SEC\u2019s Public Finance Abuse Unit requesting an investigation.\nCEI says other California governments have done the same, such as the City of Oakland, Imperial Beach, and Marin and San Mateo counties.\nThe Washington Free Beacon has requested comment from officials from San Francisco, and will add those comments when they are received."}

He recognises what's wrong, where no one else does, for a start.\n\"He recognised those darkest moments in me and gives me that extra will to fight, to carry on.\"\nFor Carwyn, talking about his father's illness is difficult - and he said he does not really understand why everyone thinks what he does is a \"big deal\".\n\"That I just feel that he isn't acting as normal, so I think to myself 'Something's not right here',\" he said.\n\"I want him to feel better. Sometimes I try to forget about it, but it's not that easy.\"\nAccording to the trust, official figures show there are 7,000 young carers in Wales but new research suggested there could be more than four times that number.\n\"We believe there could be tens of thousands of young carers that haven't been identified with schools or local authorities and there's potential to do more to identify them,\" said Ms Cubbage.\n\"In particular it's important that there's sustainable funding for local carers services to work with carers and their families.\"\nShe added that there was no reliable data on how many carers there might be, because identification is so difficult.\n\"The risk is that we miss the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of tens of thousands of young carers,\" she added.\nMs Cubbage hopes a review by Estyn will help to identify more youngsters affected so support services can be put in place for them.\nA carers' identification card will also be created, with the Welsh Government set to provide \u00a336,000 to the trust over the next year to help carers."}

Mandatory credit. REUTERS\/Kyodo\/File Photo\nTOKYO A Japanese high court on Tuesday overturned a lower court's order to shut two reactors operated by Kansai Electric Power, a company spokesman said, potentially ending a drawn-out legal battle and helping the utility to cut fuel costs.\nThe decision, while positive for Kansai Electric, is not likely to speed the broader process of getting reactors back online nationally after the Fukushima nuclear disaster of six years ago, said a former advisor to the government and others.\n\"The future of nuclear power is still uncertain. The decision does not mean that the courts will give a 'yes' to other legal cases. Political uncertainty remains strong, too,\" said Tatsujiro Suzuki, a former vice chairman of the Japan Atomic Energy Commission, a government body.\nThe Osaka High Court overturned the first court-ordered shutdown of an operating nuclear plant in Japan. The lower court had decided last year in favor of residents living near the Takahama atomic station west of Tokyo after they had petitioned for the reactors at the plant to be shut.\nKansai Electric, Japan's most nuclear-reliant utility before the disaster, estimates it will save 7 billion yen ($63 million) per month in fuel once it restarts both reactors.\nThe restart schedule for the reactors, however, is still uncertain because the utility has been conducting safety checks requested by local authorities after a large crane toppled onto another reactor building at the site due to strong winds in January, a Kansai Electric spokesman said earlier.\nThere are four reactors at the Takahama plant, with the earlier court order covering the two newest ones.\nThe company released a profit forecast after the verdict on Tuesday saying it estimates net income of 133 billion yen ($1.2 billion) in the year through March 31, 2017.\nThe Kansai case was one of many going through the courts after the Japanese public turned away from nuclear power following the Fukushima meltdowns of 2011, the world's worst nuclear calamity since Chernobyl in 1986.\nJust three out of Japan's 42 operable reactors are running and the pace of restarts has been protracted despite strong support from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government, which is keen to restore a power source that provided about a third of electricity supply before the Fukushima disaster.\nResidents have lodged injunctions against nuclear plants across Japan and lower courts have been increasingly siding with them on safety concerns.\nContentious verdicts are usually overturned by higher courts, where judges tend to be more attuned to government policy, judicial experts say.\n\"We are going to win some and we are going to lose some, but the political and social situation is such that unstable prospects for restarts are here to stay,\" Aileen Mioko Smith, an advisor to the plaintiffs and a co-plaintiff in other lawsuits, told Reuters by phone from Osaka.\nThere are more than 30 cases going through Japan's courts in which communities are seeking to stop reactors from operating, she said.\nKansai Electric shares had ended trading before the court decision was released. They closed 0.3 percent higher on Tuesday at 1,283 yen, while the broader market rose more than 1 percent.\n(Reporting by Aaron Sheldrick and Osamu Tsukimori; Editing by Tom Hogue)"}

After the city obtained Strong\u2019s CAP personnel file, Murray\u2019s office arranged for him to receive management coaching, Formas said.\nAn invoice in Strong\u2019s city personnel file \u2014 obtained Tuesday in a public-disclosure request \u2014 says a consultant was paid $280 per hour for coaching in the mayor\u2019s office.\nThe consultant\u2019s budget was $13,160, according to the invoice for work through April 19, 2017, at which point the city had spent more than $4,000.\nDocuments in Strong\u2019s city file from his time at CAP include a note about him and others making \u201cinappropriate jokes\u201d and an email informing Strong of his suspension because of \u201cinappropriate communication\u201d with a junior staff member.\nMurray resigned in September amid allegations he had sexually abused children decades before.

He signed it on Dec. 12.\nStrong left that position earlier this month after BuzzFeed News contacted him, the news outlet reported.\nIn a statement to BuzzFeed, he said in part, \u201cI made mistakes that I regret during my time living in Washington, D.C. My actions hurt someone, let down friends and colleagues, and created a difficult work environment. For that I apologize.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cWhat I learned from those mistakes has helped me to grow and change in these last two years and will continue doing so.\u201d\nHe declined to comment Tuesday to The Seattle Times."}

But for me, I really like this as they come with handy features such as the ability to track your foreign transactions in real-time (including how much they cost you in \u00a3s) and to instantly block your card if it\u2019s lost or stolen.\nHoliday money\nLast summer, we polled you here on Which?

He was 57-years-old. Warrants and other documents related to his death were unsealed yesterday, and although they don\u2019t answer all the questions related to the untimely death of the music icon, they do give insight into the extent of his opioid addiction.\nAt the time of his death, people at the home of Prince indicated to investigators that he had been suffering from withdrawals from prescription medications to which he had become addicted. Upon investigating, authorities did not find evidence of any controlled substances prescribed to Prince. They did, however, find one written to his bodyguard, Kirk Johnson, for oxycodone.\nDr. Michael Schulenberg was the star\u2019s physician. The oxycodone prescription was written by him on April 14 but was prescribed for Kirk Johnson. Schulenberg said this was to protect Prince\u2019s privacy, but his attorney has stated that he prescribed the opioid with no knowledge that they would be provided to Prince. Johnson\u2019s attorney has stated that his client did not provide the fentanyl that ultimately killed the musician. If Schulenberg did write prescriptions to Johnson that he knew were intended for Prince, he has violated both federal and state laws according to a report from CNBC.\nThe Carver County search warrant obtained within a week of the singer\u2019s death uncovered controlled substances hidden throughout his home, Paisley Park. Most were prescription painkillers according to Rolling Stone and were hidden in a variety of containers, including vitamin bottles. Zofran, a medication taken to lessen the effects of opioid withdrawal, was found in a container that was labeled for Vitamin D. Prince often used the name Peter Bravestrong as an alias. A briefcase found bearing that name held undisclosed controlled substances next to handwritten lyrics for the song \u201cU Got the Look.\u201d The source of the fentanyl that ultimately killed the music legend has still not been determined.\nInvestigators report that statements provided by those at Paisley Park when the warrant was served were not consistent and were sometimes contradictory, especially some statements made by Kirk Johnson. Among his contradictory statements were those in which he said he wasn\u2019t aware of Prince\u2019s addiction although he had contacted a rehabilitation clinic regarding the problem just days before the star\u2019s death. He eventually told police that Prince had been battling both addiction and withdrawal.\nAccording to a report from the Star Tribune, some of the prescription bottles found at Paisley Park tested positive for synthetic fentanyl. Investigators have been working under the assumption that Prince did not know that the pills he took contained the drug. The level of fentanyl found in his system during his autopsy would be fatal for anyone, according to someone familiar with the investigation.\nAmong the information included in the search warrant affidavits was that it was Johnson and Prince\u2019s personal assistant, Meron Berkure, who found him in the elevator. Emergency help was on the scene within minutes. Prior to finding him in the elevator, no one had seen or heard from the singer since 8 p.m. the previous night. One of those present when police arrived was Andrew Kornfeld. He was at Paisley Park to assess Prince for possible treatment at \u201cRecovery Without Walls,\u201d a drug dependency program run by Kornfeld\u2019s father Howard. Andrew told authorities that his father did not know about the controlled substances he had brought with him to give to Prince that would help him. He stated that he would not have administered them without a doctor present. A pamphlet for the drug dependency program was found in Prince\u2019s Purple Rain room.\nIt\u2019s not known whether authorities will be filing charges against either Schulenberg or Kornfeld.\n[Featured Image by Kevin Winter\/Getty Images]"}

The night before the conference starts, hundreds of guests were treated to a gathering of speeches from key personnel, but also featured robots from a number of startups.\nThe Mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, spoke about the benefits of technology and even suggested there should be school learning opportunities for kids in digital media to help prepare them for life. Obviously technology is being integrated into schooling systems across the globe, but she spoke about going the extra mile, like an opportunity to learn more about areas of interests from students. If someone takes to a skill like video editing, or programming, these outside of school sessions would allow them to explore those skills further.\nWe also heard from the COO of Retail and Banking Services at BNP Paribas, Sophie Heller who praised the benefits of working with startups. At the heart of it, the people who work for startups are incredibly resourceful with little resources and in large enterprises, that mentality can go a long way. Then there\u2019s the ingrained problem-solved nature of leveraging technology to make things more efficient. This mindset is something many companies should consider, not just acquiring a startup for their IP, but to work with startups and learn to integrate that hustle inside their culture.\nThere was one group of startups on show last night, that was robotics. while there were a number on offer, the star of the show was Leenby, a semi-humanoid mobile and autonomous robot from Cyberdroid.\nLeenby instantly drew a crowd and with its head-mounted lidar guidance system, led eyes and a tray of drinks, its easy to understand why.\nMeasuring 1.4m tall and weighing 30kg Leenby has an 8 hour battery life and can understand and navigate an ever changing environment around it. It does that using two lidar sensors and a stereovision camera system, the robot is able to map its environment, recognize objects, and detect people.\nConsequently, the robot can direct itself towards a predefined lightweight object in order to grasp it and hand it to a designated person. Obviously as technology improves the weight of items it can carry would improve, increasing the use cases possible.\nLeenby is designed to address the needs of the elderly and disabled, both at home or in a medical or nursing environment. Being wireless, the list of potential tasks Leenby could perform includes escorting a person back to their room (even hold their hand), delivering food and beverages, detecting a person in immediate danger and formulating the right solution, and interacting with the person and securing their environment.\nStarted back in 2011, Cyberdroid is now in its 5th generation and can interact using speech recognition and synthesis. When a keyword is said that it understands, the robot will react with emotions and speak back, as if that person was interacting with another human.\nAlthough designed to function autonomously, it can be connected to Bluetooth, Wifi, mobile and even 4G. This opens the door to pushing scheduled commands to the robots, allowing routines, even across patients, through the day. Even better, they\u2019ve added support for around 5 languages, supporting even more potential applications internationally.\nStrapped to the back of the robot is an accessible laptop, as well as a speaker that emits the sound when communicating with people. In this implementation, there\u2019s also a USB port built into the serving tray so you can recharge your phone from it.\nFor more information, head to Cyberdroid.com\nFor all of the photos from last night, here\u2019s the gallery, enjoy, the Paris City Town Hall really is a stunning building."}

{"id":"256e65ea-5fb2-4201-b22c-f196e9dce828","text":"Adrian Beltre's Fantasy appeal has taken a hit over the last year, and rightly so. The 38-year-old is deservedly being dinged for his age, because by this point most players have long since passed the point of Fantasy relevance.\nHe's also being dinged for his injury-plagued 2017, and rightly so. After playing at least 143 games in five straight seasons, soft-muscle injuries to his calf and hamstring limited him to just 94 games. At his age, Beltre is going to be a perpetual injury risk, and the Rangers are already talking about getting him more time at DH to manage that.\nBeltre carries more than his share of red flags. And, after being drafted in the fourth-through-sixth round range a year ago, it makes sense that we would discount him given those red flags. But the Fantasy community has gone too far, overcorrecting to the point where, despite those red flags, Beltre is a bargain at his current price.\nThat price is somewhere in the 12th round, on average, in a 12-team league. Scott White called Beltre one of the 12 best Draft Day values in a column last week, but I want to highlight him, to really drive the point home. Beltre is currently being taken as the 19th third baseman off the board on average based on consensus ADP , and even if you account for players who might be used at other positions thanks to multi-eligibility, he still peaks at 15th.\nBeltre is risky, yes, but we actually haven't seen much of a decline in his skill set. As this chart of Beltre's triple-slash batting lines since leaving Seattle shows, he was basically the same guy he has always been in 2017:\nIf you project his 2017 production out to 150 games, he would have finished with 27 homers, 113 RBI, and 75 runs scored, pretty much in line with where he's been the last few years. When he was on the field, Adrian Beltre was still Adrian Beltre, and the underlying batted ball and contact numbers back that up, too.\nWhich is to say, he was one of the best hitters in baseball yet again. Only six third basemen had a higher OPS than Beltre in 2017, and his 150-game pace of 188 RBI+R would have been good for fourth at the position. His age gives him some risk of the bottom just falling out, but we haven't seen any sign of a decline in his skill set, and I'm not going to project a gigantic dropoff yet either.\nHowever, even if we acknowledge that Beltre carries a large amount of risk due to his age and last season's injuries, he isn't exactly alone in that regard. In fact, from his No. 19 spot in ADP at the position to the No. 9 spot, I would say nearly every player carries significant red flags:\nNo. 19: Beltre -- Injuries, age\nNo. 18: Jake Lamb -- Platoon issues, second-half struggles, Humidor\nNo. 17: Marwin Gonzalez -- Limited track record\nNo. 16: Kyle Seager -- Limited upside\nNo. 15: Mike Moustakas -- Bad lineup, limited track record\nNo. 14: Joey Gallo -- Limited track record, strikeout rate\nNo. 13: Nick Castellanos -- Bad lineup, limited track record\nNo. 12: Miguel Sano -- Injuries, off-field concerns, strikeout rate\nNo. 11: Rafael Devers -- Limited track record\nNo. 10: Travis Shaw -- Limited track record\nNo. 9: Justin Turner -- Age, injuries, limited track record\nSome of these concerns are smaller than others, to be sure. For instance, Travis Shaw's limited track record isn't much of a red flag to me given his home park and lineup; Kyle Seager's upside may not be as limited as the Fantasy community seems to think -- he hit .278-89-30-99-3 in 2016.\nBut the key here is, of these players, only Turner was better than Beltre on a per-game basis in 2017. And none of them has a track record over the last decade that even comes close to Beltre's. His red flags have to carry a lot of weight to drop him this low at the position, and once you start going through the players individually, it doesn't make much sense.\nAre Miguel Sano and Rafael Devers really that much more likely to be better hitters than Adrian Beltre in 2018? I suppose it's possible, but the smart money -- and projection systems -- are on Beltre's side here. And are they really that much less risky? Sano has played more than 129 games as a professional once, had offseason surgery, and came into camp reportedly overweight. Devers is an elite talent but is just 21, with one minor-league campaign with an OPS over an .800 OPS in 100-plus games. A sophomore slump is entirely possible.\nAll of this is to say, Beltre carries just as much upside -- and just as much risk -- as guys being drafted six rounds ahead of him at the same position. Let people be scared off him. It'll be their loss, because Beltre looks like the best value on the board right now.\nDraft him everywhere. I know I am."}

Most often, the injuries were not serious.\nHowever, one child died each month, on average -- usually from strangulation by window-blind cords.\n\"We've known about this risk for over 70 years, yet we're still seeing children strangled by these products,\" said study senior researcher Dr. Gary Smith. \"It's just unacceptable.\"\nSmith directs the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.\nCordless blinds are available -- and can be made affordably, according to Smith. That makes it \"very doable,\" he said, for manufacturers to replace corded blinds with safe alternatives.\nOver the years, the industry has come up with voluntary safety standards to make it less likely that children would entangled in blind cords. Those efforts included getting rid of loops in the pull cord that children can stick their heads through.\nBut those measures have not been enough, Smith said.\nIn 2014, he noted, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) proposed a rule that would require blinds to be cordless or have cords that are inaccessible to children.\nSo far, it hasn't been put into action.\nSmith said he thinks it's time for regulators to move on the issue.\nDr. Barbara Pena is research director of the emergency department at Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami. \"Many people probably think this is a thing of the past, but it's still happening,\" she said.\nSome parents and caregivers, she said, may not even realize that corded window blinds are a hazard to young children.\nSo as long as the products are still out there, Pena said, awareness is the first critical step.\nSmith agreed that lack of awareness is a problem. Sometimes, he said, families think that the pull cord on the blinds is the only risk -- and that keeping it out of kids' reach is enough."}

This was the first time a portable device was used for these tests. The results show the device accurately indicated reduced electrical activity in the retina in multiple cell layers in the participants who had schizophrenia, including in cell types that had not been studied before in this disorder.\n\u201cSchizophrenia is a devastating disorder, probably the most disabling disorder long term. Although we know quite a bit about it, it\u2019s still not that well understood,\u201d said Steven Silverstein, professor of psychiatry at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and director of research at Rutgers University Behavioral Health Care (UBHC), who designed the study. \u201cOur study should help generate further research into developing a test that clinicians \u2013 like psychologists, psychiatrists or nurses \u2013 can use in their offices to diagnose, treat and monitor the condition of people with schizophrenia.\u201d\nLooking at biomarkers in the eye as a way to understand psychiatric disorders is a new field of study.\n\u201cSince the retina is part of the nervous system, what is happening in the retina is likely reflective of what is occurring in the brain,\u201d Silverstein said. \u201cFor example, we know that certain changes in the retina, like thinning tissue [due to cell loss] or weakening electrical activity, occur alongside loss of brain tissue and reduced brain activity in patients with neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis and Parkinson\u2019s disease. We and other researchers are now investigating whether retinal changes are related to brain structure and function changes in schizophrenia.\u201d\nIn the just-published study, the researchers evaluated 50 participants: 25 with schizophrenia and 25 with no diagnosed psychiatric disorder. In the test, the participants closed one eye and placed the other against the RETeval device, which flashed 10 to 20 white or colored lights of various intensity against a white or colored background. A tiny skin electrode was placed on the skin under the eye to record the retina\u2019s electrical activity. The participants were tested in normal light and after sitting in the dark for 10 minutes to assess activity in different types of retinal cells. Most individual tests were completed within two minutes.\n\u201cSince many of our participants were experiencing severe psychiatric symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, we wanted to use a test that was as noninvasive and quick as possible,\u201d Silverstein said.\n\u201cWhile the portable device clearly distinguished people with schizophrenia from those without a psychiatric diagnosis, it\u2019s too soon to call this a diagnostic tool,\u201d said lead author Docia Demmin, a graduate assistant in UBHC\u2019s Division of Schizophrenia Research and a doctoral student in Rutgers Department of Psychology. \u201cHowever, since every prior study has found that people with schizophrenia exhibit reduced retinal wave forms and slowed retinal responses, our research shows that we closing in on an accurate test that is faster, less invasive, inexpensive and more accessible to patients.\u201d"}

It\u2019s really nice to know that they\u2019re still supporting us.\n\u201cThis was our first business and in some ways it feels like it was just yesterday that we opened.\u201d\nOne of those regular customers is 81-year-old Margaret Bowler of Carlton, who has forged a close relationship with Mr and Mrs Chan over the past several years.\nMrs Bowler even served as the couple's community midwife when they had their three children before she retired 20 years ago.\nShe regularly visits the Carlton Hill chip shop and said the Chans have had a big impact on the community.\nMrs Bowler said: \u201cThe Chans always greet customers with a smile and warm welcome. The fish and chips are always fresh as they do not fry the fish until you place the order, so the meal is fresh when you leave the shop.\n(Image: Joseph Raynor)\n\u201cPeople travel quite a distance to Mr and Mrs Chan\u2019s because of the quality of their fish and chips and their courteousness is apparent when you enter the shop. They have served the community for 37 years, when in the beginning there was only two take away food shops on Carlton Hill. Now there are 16 at last count.\n\u201cI would like to send them away with a celebration and thanks for all their efforts in keeping the service going to the community in Carlton.\u201d\nMr and Mrs Chan also used their platform in the community to raise money for the Myotonic Dystrophy Support Group, which was founded by Mrs Bowler in 1987, and have raised more than \u00a3500 through a countertop collection box.\nThough the couple don\u2019t have an official date for leaving the shop, they confirmed that they will be retiring in late March or early April after which they plan to spend their time travelling the world together.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to go back to Hong Kong and then we want to see the world,\u201d Mrs Chan said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s bittersweet to be retiring after so long. It\u2019s a bit sad but it feels like the right time. We\u2019ll really miss our customers the most. Over 37 years, working in the chip shop every day and building relationships with them has become a part of our lifestyle.\u201d"}

Just the opposite of what is true.\nThis is ironic since the natural gas industry emits more radioactivity than all of nuclear in America combined. And more people die every year from natural gas than any other electricity source except coal.\nThe Issue\nThe issue in these states is that warped wholesale electricity markets, renewable subsidies and cheap natural gas from hydraulic fracturing (fracing) have made low-cost nuclear power just not low enough for short-term profitability, putting some nuclear plants at risk of closing. Several have already closed and six more are scheduled to close in the next ten years.\nMost climate scientists, like Jim Hansen, and economists say that a small subsidy, much smaller than renewables get, is necessary to keep these plants open and preserve both the low-carbon power and the generation diversity needed to weather changes in the market and in the climate. During the last Polar Vortex, nuclear was the only source unaffected by the extreme cold. And nuclear costs are stable and predictable for decades, unlike natural gas or renewables.\nThe trend has power regulators worried, with those in New York and Illinois recently approving subsidies to keep their nuclear fleets operating, saving thousands of high-paying jobs and most of the states\u2019 clean energy. The regulators and utility operators know how important energy diversity and baseload power are to the stability of the electric grid. This is an esoteric concept that most people do not understand, yet it rules their daily energy lives.\nA new article for Scientific American points to the overwhelming evidence that saving nuclear plants is the most environmentally significant and cost-effective thing that governors can do for their states.\nAPI does not want any help to go to nuclear, which it sees as a competitor, and a hurdle to their plan for natural gas rising to 80% of electricity generation in these markets. They want to capture this monopoly quickly before natural gas prices rise after America links to the global market in the next several years.\nThe gas industry is frantically building liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities and coastal terminals in order to enter the global market, which should increase natural gas prices in the United States by between 50% and 100%. They want to stop nuclear since the lead times for nuclear builds or even relicensing are so long, that the nuclear industry may not be able recover after gas prices increase, and consumers will be stuck with higher electricity prices for decades.\nGas is perfectly positioned for this takeover since the wholesale markets in these states were changed in the last twenty years such that natural gas became the most desirable source after 2007.\nThe natural gas industry actually admitted in court (personal communications from the PA State Legislature) that helping nuclear will rob the gas industry of $600 million in profits per year that would come from consumers. Keeping nuclear open would only cost $200 million per year, a clear benefit to the citizens of Pennsylvania and Ohio.\nAPI is calling this legislative help for nuclear a \u2018nuclear bailout\u2019 \u2013 which it is not.\nThese plans do not involve subsidies. Nuclear plants get paid by electric customers at a cost-based rate approved by state public commissions. There is no taxpayer funding. The plan effectively makes them public utilities.\nEIA\nThe Details\nElectric customers pay a rate that blends the costs from all generation sources, which is the way it was before deregulation and the emergence of non-utility generators, mostly natural gas. For decades, natural gas generation was by far the highest price generation source but consumers never paid its high costs because they were blended with low cost nuclear. That was not a subsidy for gas generation and these new plans to preserve nuclear are not a subsidy or a bailout either.\nUnfortunately, the gas industry\u2019s strategy of misinformation seems to be working. Efforts by the utility First Energy to get Ohio legislators to create new regulations enacting zero emission credits (ZECs) for the Davis-Besse and Perry nuclear power plants have stalled out according to news media reports.\nExelon Vice President Joseph Dominguez said in testimony to the Ohio Senate\u2019s Public Utilities Committee on June 1 that six nuclear reactors in five states have shut down and another seven nuclear reactors will shut down prematurely by 2019. This is a result of electricity markets not properly valuing the benefits of baseload electricity.\nNuclear power produces over 68% of America\u2019s low-carbon power. Non-hydro renewables produce less than 10%. If these nuclear power plants are lost, it will wipe out more low-carbon generation than all the power produced by wind, solar and geothermal in America.\nAnother reason that legislators are gun shy about calling for a vote on this issue is the intensity of the opposition. In addition to industry, consumer groups and interest groups, like the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), mobilized to stop the proposal. Funded by API and the Oil&Gas industry, AARP\u2019s efforts called ZECs a \u2018subsidy designed to prop up a failed business model.\u2019\nFunny how they don\u2019t mind an even more failed business model for renewables which are more expensive than nuclear, and require both higher subsidies and natural gas plants to back them up, negating much of their low-carbon claim.\nBut the fear-mongering about radiation and safety is truly fake news at its worst. Whenever radioactive emissions come up in discussions of nuclear power, scientists always point out that the mining, drilling and burning of fossil fuels emit much more radiation in total than nuclear energy does.\nAnd that\u2019s true. Radioactive materials are common in fossil fuel deposits like natural gas, including uranium (both U-238 and U-235), thorium (Th-232), potassium (K-40), radon (Rn-222) and radium (Ra-226). This last one is the hottest and has a 1,600 year half-life. It\u2019s release through fracing has been the subject of many studies and regulations.\nBut even though these levels from natural gas exploration and development are higher than in the nuclear industry, there is still no reason to be afraid. Just like there\u2019s no reason to be afraid of radiation from nuclear power, there\u2019s no big reason to be afraid of radiation from natural gas.\nIt\u2019s just the hypocrisy of the gas industry that\u2019s annoying.\nBut with regard to safety and accidents, that\u2019s a different story. The deathprint of different power sources is fascinating. Coal is far and away the most deadly from a public health perspective, killing over 10,000 Americans a year, and well over 300,000 Chinese a year since China doesn\u2019t have a Clean Air Act like we do. Natural gas only kills about a thousand, so that\u2019s pretty good.\nNuclear kills only one person every decade, and that\u2019s from ordinary things like falling off a ladder. There has never been a death resulting from radiation in the history of the commercial nuclear industry.\nSince 2000, there have been over 200 natural gas pipeline and facility explosions, ruptures or leaks that have killed dozens of people, destroyed many facilities and homes, and led to serious population evacuations.\nAnd thanks to fracing for natural gas, earthquake hazards in parts of Oklahoma are now comparable to California. The United States Geological Survey has produced a seismic hazard forecast for the central and eastern United States showing a 5% to 17% chance of significant damage to homes and structures each year for areas of Oklahoma and Kansas where fracking occurs.\nThere have been no explosions or serious accidents involving nuclear reactors ever in America. Three Mile Island way back in 1979 was a stuck valve that resulted in no environmental or health effects. Radiation was completely contained onsite. Only one person has died in the nuclear industry since 2000, falling from a height. Since 2000, over 50 people have died from similar falls in the wind industry.\nAnd nuclear power does not cause earthquakes.\nAlong with fear of death and destruction, API is pushing the economic angle as well, saying that closing nuclear plants would save money for consumers.\nBut every other study about closing nuclear plants prematurely shows just the opposite. The Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology published a new study which found that saving nuclear would come at a cost of $4-7\/MWh on average in these markets, which is much lower than the cost of subsidizing wind power, which is about $23\/MWh.\nA study from the Brattle Group shows that losing Ohio\u2019s nuclear plants would cost taxpayers $177 in higher electricity bills each year.\nAnother study showed even more negative impacts from prematurely closing nuclear plants. If Byron, Clinton and Quad Cities nuclear plants in Illinois close prematurely, this analysis found that the initial output losses to Illinois would be $3.6 billion. The output losses would increase annually and, by 2030, would reach $4.8 billion. Losses in revenue and jobs would reverberate for decades after the premature plant closures, and host communities would probably never fully recover.\nA Berkeley study, led by David Haas, studied the abrupt closure of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) in 2012, showing that the lost generation from SONGS was met largely by increased in-state natural gas generation. In the twelve months following the closure, they found that the SONGS closure increased generation costs at other plants by $350 million, almost all of it from increased natural gas use.\nThe closure also created binding transmission constraints, causing short-run inefficiencies and allowing manipulations of the market, making it more profitable for certain plants to act non-competitively, again mainly natural gas. The closure also wiped out most of the low-carbon gains from all California\u2019s renewables, not that the oil and gas industry cares much about global warming.\nNatural gas results in more carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. than coal does, so it\u2019s always surprising that the same people who claim to care about the planet want gas over nuclear.\nThe problem is anyone can just make up stuff to feed to the news agencies and the public since nuclear science is basically unknown to everyone but a few scientists. Who even knows how a nuclear plant works? Or what a picoCurie is? Or that potato chips are the most radioactive food? Or the difference between nuclear weapons and commercial nuclear power?\nIn the absence of understanding, anything goes. And fear and disaster sells. Because nuclear weapons have figured so important in our history, and looms again in the guise of North Korea, you would think nuclear science would have been basic curricula in high school since WWII.\nBut it hasn\u2019t. Instead, fear, misunderstanding and outright lies have been the nuclear diet for America over the last 40 years.\nAnd the gas industry is serving it up in heaps.\n(Disclosure \u2013 Conca was or is a member of API, AAPG, AARP, the Sierra Club, and the American Nuclear Society and has worked in both the nuclear and Oil&Gas industries)\nDr. James Conca is an expert on energy, nuclear and dirty bombs, a planetary geologist, and a professional speaker.

County Manager Kelly Atkins announced on Thursday that Patton has been hired as the new veterans service officer for Lincoln County, effective Jan. 3.\n\u201cAlex has a true understanding and passion for veterans and members of the military,\u201d Atkins said. \u201cAt times, he and his family volunteer their time and services to provide supplies to deployed marines. He has an exceptional customer service-oriented skill-set and a solid understanding of what is needed to assist our veterans. What impresses me the most about Mr. Patton is the level of attention with which he approaches every situation.\u201d\nPatton\u2019s tenure as a commissioner ended following the November election. He chose to not seek re-election.\nPatton enters this new position with an extensive military background. He enlisted in the United States Army in 1980, serving four years on active duty, which included one year of service in Korea. He specialized in military intelligence, setting up radio and landline networks to facilitate combat field communications.\nFollowing his four years of active-duty service, Patton remained involved with the military in a reserve role. He became the communications chief of an engineer battalion with the National Guard in Mooresville. He continued his work in tactical communications for 11 years before retiring from the service for good in 1995.\nPatton referred to this new position as his \u201cdream job\u201d and said he applied for the post 10 years ago. He backed out at that time because he would have had to resign from the Lincoln County Board of Commissioners and he felt as though that would have been unfair to the citizens who had elected him for the first time two years prior.\n\u201cThis job means everything to me,\u201d Patton said. \u201cI\u2019ve always enjoyed helping people and, to me, there\u2019s no better group of people that I can help than veterans. My son is a combat veteran who served with the marines in Afghanistan and my father-in-law is a disabled veteran, so the lives of my family revolve around the military. My wife is a state coordinator for Operation Santa USMC and she has sent over 6,000 stockings to deployed marines over the past several years. I don\u2019t view this as a job, I view it as an opportunity to serve the veterans of this county.\u201d\nIn this role, Patton will be responsible for providing customer service and assistance to all Lincoln County veterans and their families. According to Atkins, he will oversee the coordination and research of programs that will assist all areas of need for the veterans of Lincoln County.\n\u201cA lot of our Lincoln County veterans go to other counties for their services and I want them to understand that we\u2019re here to provide services for whatever it is that they need,\u201d Patton said. \u201cThe job is to help them apply for VA benefits, but I want it to be to where if the veteran needs help with a resume, we can do that. If they need to find somebody to paint their house, we can help them with that. I want them to understand that, no matter what they need, they can come see us. I want to get out in the community as well because a lot of people aren\u2019t even aware that there is a veterans service officer out there to help. Finally, I want to build a relationship with active duty troops so that when they get off of active duty they know who to come and see.\u201d\nPatton is stepping in for Eric Robinson, who is retiring from the post. Veterans service officer is a full-time position with an annual salary of approximately $48,000.\nImage courtesy of LTN File"}

Maybe.\nIt\u2019s hard to convey the enormity of the Daleks\u2019 impact on British popular culture in their 54-year lifespan, their pepper-pot appearance and wobbly voices terrifying generations of children who dared peek at the TV from behind the safety of the sofa whenever the Skaro natives showed up on screen.\nOne of their biggest fans, British writer and filmmaker Victor Lewis-Smith, is keen to set to work on a tell-all Dalek documentary for cinema release. But he needs your help.\nThe unexpurgated history\nLewis-Smith says that while the BBC has commissioned a ton of programming from him over the years, \u201cthere\u2019s one proposal they have always rejected. That\u2019s the unexpurgated history of the Daleks. Why? What secrets about the Daleks do they want to keep hidden?\u201d\nHe\u2019s therefore turning to crowdfunding in a bid to cobble together the cash to get the movie \u2014 called The Undiscovered Daleks \u2014 off the ground.\nThe filmmaker says that, to his amazement, no documentary maker has ever taken the Daleks on despite their enduring fame and popularity.\nLewis-Smith is clearly up for the challenge, claiming that \u201cit\u2019s time to investigate the myths, misunderstandings, and unknown stories that surround these cybernetic monsters.\u201d\nThe weirder side\nBesides delving into the Daleks\u2019 fictional and real life stories, the movie will also explore \u201cthe weirder side, such as The Gay Daleks, pop star Daleks, and Dalek merchandise.\u201d It also plans to include interviews with famous Dalek fans, among them former Doctor Who actor Tom Baker, occasional Doctor Who writer Mark Gatiss, and the multi-talented Stephen Fry.\n\u201cEvery aspect of Dalek culture will be explored,\u201d the filmmaker promises.\nThe project is hoping to raise 250,000 pounds (about $320,000) in funds, which will go toward restoring and transfering archive material onto modern formats as well as travel costs for interviews with Doctor Who writers, actors, and designers, and of course to pay a professional film crew.\nDalek message\nPledge 10 pounds ($13) and you can download the movie within a month of its theater release. For an extra 15 pounds you\u2019ll get your name in the credits. Truly dedicated Dalek fans can spend a day with the production team for 5,000 pounds ($6,400), while 1,000 pounds ($1,275) will get you a two-minute personalized video message from a Dalek. Now what proper Dalek fan wouldn\u2019t want a personalized video message from a Dalek?\nThe plan is to premiere The Undiscovered Daleks at a London movie theater, followed by a limited nationwide release in major cities.

(Photo: Steven Shundich)\nArgentina versus Nigeria: A match to remember\nThis twelfth World Cup match I have had the privilege to attend was no less thrilling than the first. Argentina versus Nigeria in a must-win situation for either team to advance to the Round of 16. Superstar Lionel Messi, still looking for his first goal of the 2018 tournament. A $1.1 billion Saint Petersburg Stadium (Krestovsky Stadium after the tournament) filled to capacity (64,468) with mostly delirious, singing, screaming Argentine fans.\nApoplectic Argentina fans cheer after their side's first goal. (Photo: Steven Shundich)\nIt did not disappoint. Messi opened the scoring with a beautiful run in the 14th minute, becoming the first player ever to post a goal as a teen, in his 20s and now 30s in a World Cup. Nigerian Victor Moses equalizes with a penalty kick in the 51st minute, to the delight of a few hundred select fans in green. Then, intense back-and-forth play until the mostly light blue and white striped crowd burst into tears as Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo blasts home the winner in the 86th minute \u2013 an entire nation removed from suicide watch.\nThe only greater drama was happening just a few feet directly below me (see photo), where Argentine futbol legend Diego Maradona was literally being held up by his handlers so he could wave to an adoring crowd. As Cincinnatians, imagine attending a World Series with Pete or Johnny or Little Joe. Or a UC Final Four with Oscar. Now multiply that feeling by 1,000. That is how Argentinians react to Maradona.\nMaradona is held up by his handlers to cheer after Messi\u2019s goal.

Others were not so kind, just shaking their heads and uttering \u201cdrogadicto.\u201d\nMaradona, and other soccer legends, were reportedly being paid $10,000+ to attend matches of their home countries, as part of a FIFA marketing plan. I\u2019d say they got their money\u2019s worth from the 54-year-old caricature, who was whisked away to hospital after the match for what he later claimed to be a wine binge.\nWarm Bud from the Warm Beer Team. (Photo: Steven Shundich)\nWant less drama from the Argentina-Nigeria match? Just leave your seat during play. There was no one in the bathroom. Not a single person in the beer line. Just a handful of bored young Russians serving warm Bud at $5.57 a pop. Elapsed time: 3 minutes. Imagine that at an FC Cincy match at Nippert! Absolutely no one leaves their seats when the game is on at World Cup. Just me.\nMeanwhile, at Fan Fest\nEvery World Cup city has a Fan Fest, where you can drink more warm Bud and watch all the day\u2019s matches outside on big screens. In Saint Petersburg, the backdrop was the the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood, built on the site where Emperor Alexander II was assassinated in 1881.\nThe Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood In Saint Petersburg at Fan Fest. (Photo: Steven Shundich)\nThis was highly appropriate for the match I watched, where top-ranked and reigning World Cup champion Germany was eliminated by none other than South Korea, not exactly a powerhouse.\nI know it\u2019s a rare site, but have you ever seen the look on the face of a Steelers fan after a loss to the Bengals? Never? OK, that\u2019s probably not a good example. Anyway, just imagine a really, really sad and disappointed face. That was the expression on the typical German fan face after their devastating 2-0 loss.\nBut I will also say I saw more smiles than frowns in the crowd that day. Because, this, of course, is Russia.\nEPISODE 2, PART 2: A LITTLE BIT ABOUT RUSSIAN CULTURE\nThis is Russia\nPolitical-themed Russian nesting dolls for sale at Peterhof Palace in Saint Petersburg, Russia. (Photo: Steven Shundich)\nThe first Russian I met, on the train from Helsinki to Saint Petersburg, worked for a conglomerate that owns a gold mine in Mali. Well, he wasn\u2019t really the first. That was Stanislav, who got kicked out of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs for trying to network a little too aggressively with the business and political leaders who spoke at the events.\nI don\u2019t speak Russian, so I have no right to complain about the stilted conversation on the train. He was an IT engineer. From Magadan, in Siberia, across from Alaska. I told him I was from Chicago, to which he replied, \u201cAl Capone.\u201d\nIt still boggles the mind that more than 70 years after his death, \u201cAl Capone\u201d still is the first thing to come to a foreigner\u2019s mind when they hear the word \u201cChicago\u201d (in past travels, to Singapore and Brasil, for example, it was \u201cGangsters!\u201d and \u201cBang! Bang!\u201d respectively).\nLuckily, the next things he said were \u201cBulls\u201d and \u201cMichael Jordan,\u201d which typically are the second and third things that pop out.\nThe next Russian I met, Andrei, in Saint Petersburg, inserted himself (without asking) at our pub table and, when he found out I was from Chicago, said, \u201cMobsters!\u201d and immediately launched into the story of Chicago crime boss Sam Giancana\u2019s alleged hit request on Frank Sinatra. That was followed by a mocking of U.S. involvement in World War II, where he said we \u201cwould still be asleep\u201d were it not for the attack on Pearl Harbor.\nThe tone in these encounters was very direct, almost blunt, and without color. No small talk. No humor. Straight to the point.\nAnastasia, from the 1912 bar The Red Corner on Nekrasova Street, our favorite jazz and movie loving bartender in Saint Petersburg, Russia. (Photo: Steven Shundich)\nThat all changed with Anastasia, the bartender at The Red Corner, a pub at 6 Nekrasova Street in Saint Petersburg. In perfect English, she spoke of her love of jazz and the movies.\nShe loves Jennifer Lawrence.\nI asked, \u201cEven in Red Sparrow?\u201d (loosely, a spy thriller about a woman recruited to use her body as a weapon for a Russian intelligence service).\n\u201cNo, that was horrible!\u201d Anastasia said. \u201cJeremy Irons was perfect as a Soviet general, but did you see that tiny dressing room at the Bolshoi? That was completely wrong. The dressing rooms there are huge!\u201d\nThe dressing room?\nThat brings me to my next point. When speaking with a Russian, you really have no idea what they do or do not know. Was \u201cRed Sparrow\u201d heavily redacted? What did Anastasia actually see? Where do Russians get their information?\nThe televisions I saw in public places were definitely not tuned in to CNN or the BBC. What they have here is the government-funded RT (formerly Russia Today) television network. If you\u2019ve ever watched this station, and we have it in Chicago, your mind will be blown by the reporting of events with a completely opposite view of what you believe to be true. The annexation of Crimea? That was simply an exercise to save the lives of defenseless Russian nationals from attacks by Ukrainian fascists.\nHere, during World Cup, bar after bar after bar featured endless loops of 20- and 30-something punks skateboarding, surfing and skydiving to a techno beat, to be interrupted only by an hour parkour in exotic, graffiti-riddled locales.\nSome of what I learned\nI am by nature an inquisitive person (with a quirky sense of humor), and in Russia I learned a few things that will help you avoid the embarrassment of seeing a potential friend walk away:\nNever ask a Russian if they think Putin is a dictator.\nNever ask a Russian if they believe Anastasia Romanov is still alive.\nAnd never, NEVER say \u201cCatherine the Great\u201d and \u201chorse\u201d in the same sentence.\nA Vladimir Putin coffee mug being sold outside Church of Our Savior on Spilled Blood in Saint Petersburg, Russia. (Photo: Steven Shundich)\nA Vladimir Putin coffee mug being sold outside Church of Our Savior on Spilled Blood in Saint Petersburg, Russia. (Photo: Steven Shundich)\nAnd yes, Russians do NOT smile.\nLet me clarify, Russians on the street do not smile. They DO smile when I say one of the few words I know in Russian, \u201cSpasibo\u201d (spah-SEE-bah), which means \u201cthank you.\u201d\nAnd I did get a laugh when I was briefly trapped inside a basement dive bar\u2019s tiny, closet-like WC with a broken lock.\n\u201cToilet trap!\u201d they cried, delighted. Ha, ha. Very funny.\nTravel expert Rick Steves says this is a cultural thing, and that Russians are very warm once they get to know you. But it is not easy to break the ice \u2013 and I\u2019m a friendly guy! You can\u2019t even flirt with waitresses, who respond in one and two word monotone commands: \u201cWait,\u201d \u201cOrder please,\u201d \u201cCheck?\u201d\nI found the same thing in Estonia, where they have an expression, \u201cIt\u2019s easier to make your laptop cry than to get an Estonian to smile.\u201d\n\u201cWe are so used to loud, pushy Russians,\u201d explained one young Estonian woman. \u201cWe want our country to be different, so we act calm.\u201d\nIn Russia, my best guess is that if you come from an insular society, where you trust only your closest family or friends; where you may fear the threat of constant surveillance \u2013 you are not going to let down your guard. It\u2019s a helluva way to live a life, but those are the cards they were dealt.\nAnd about Saint Petersburg\nA view down always-busy Nevsky Prospekt, the Michigan Avenue of Saint Petersburg, Russia. (Photo: Steven Shundich)\nSaint Petersburg is one of the most beautiful and interesting places I have ever seen. For World Cup, no doubt, it has been spruced up with a fresh coat of paint. The streets are immaculate. Workers have memorized key English phrases. And I get a general sense that the authorities have been instructed to leave the tourists alone.\nAnd there are tourists here from everywhere. Many from Germany, France, Spain, Argentina, Brasil, Mexico, Japan and elsewhere are here for the World Cup. Cruise lines from Stockholm, Helsinki and Tallinn bring thousands more, many from China.\nOf all visiting countries, it was U.S. citizens who actually purchased the most World Cup tickets (despite not qualifying), according to FIFA. It was a great way to avoid bureaucratic hassles, as ticket holders automatically get a free 30-day VISA.\nWhen planning, most guide books tell you to always carry your passport, and to beware of ATMs and free WiFi. But almost every transaction here can be and is done by chip-protected credit card. It was the same in Estonia and Finland \u2013 almost cashless societies.\nCredit card transactions will get you a 63 ruble per dollar exchange rate. I was offered 40 (!) by a currency exchange in Helsinki and only 52 at the Saint Petersburg airport. Use an ATM, preferably at a bank, if you need cash.\nThere also are apps now that are incredibly useful. One of the most important is Yandex, which provides maps, navigation and taxi services a la Uber \u2013 with instructions conveniently converted into English. A short trip could cost as little as $2 U.S.\nThe Peterhof Palace, summer home to Peter the Great in Saint Petersburg, Russia. (Photo: Steven Shundich)\nI also was told by several people that outside of Moscow and Saint Petersburg, Russia is Third World. Make no mistake, Saint Petersburg is a world apart, with major attractions like the Hermitage, Peterhof Palace, the Church of Our Savior on Spilled Blood, the Faberge Museum and so much more.\nRussian women pose during a fashion show inside the Summer Garden, Saint Petersburg, Russia. (Photo: Steven Shundich)\nIt\u2019s also a place where you will see the unexpected. Like, in the nightlife district along Rubinstein Street off Nevsky Prospekt, you may see a man with a pet raccoon. Or a horse walking down a busy sidewalk, tourist onboard.\nI asked a small group, \u201cWhy is there a horse walking down the sidewalk at 2 a.m.?\u201d\n\u201cBecause this is Russia!\u201d they cried.\nIndeed, this is Russia.\nComing next: Episode 3: Parnu, Estonia; Riga, Latvia; Krakow, Poland\nSteven Shundich is a writer based in Chicago.

Now some of those same business leaders are turning on President Trump.\nOn Monday, Kenneth Frazier, the CEO of Merck (MRK), joined the growing list of executives who feel compelled by Trump's words and policies to take a stand against him.\nFrazier, one of the country's most prominent black business leaders, quit Trump's manufacturing council to \"take a stand against intolerance and extremism.\"\nThat appeared to be a reference to Trump's statement over the weekend blaming the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, on \"many sides\" after neo-Nazis and white nationalists clashed with counter-protesters.\nTrump lashed out at Frazier within minutes, saying the resignation would give him \"more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\nThen, on Monday afternoon, Trump specifically called out the KKK and neo-Nazis. By then almost two days had passed since the president's first remarks on Charlottesville -- and some of the nation's most prominent business leaders had filled the gap with denunciations of racism.\nBusiness leaders have spoken against Trump before. In January, his ban on travel from certain Muslim-majority countries drew criticism from Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) CEO Jeff Bezos, Starbucks (SBUX) boss Howard Schultz, Netflix (NFLX, Tech30) CEO Reed Hastings, Apple's (AAPL, Tech30) Tim Cook and many, many others.\nIn June, Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and Disney's (DIS) Bob Iger quit Trump's business council in protest of his decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord.\nOn immigration, racism and climate change, CEOs have sought to provide the moral leadership they perceive to be lacking from the White House.\n\"America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy,\" Frazier said in his statement on Monday.\nRelated: Trump lashes out at black CEO who quits council\nGoldman Sachs (GS) CEO Lloyd Blankfein referenced such a leadership void in June when he fired off his first-ever tweet to criticize Trump's retreat from the Paris climate agreement.\n\"Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world,\" he said at the time.\nJeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale School of Management professor who leads the university's annual CEO summit, said business leaders are stepping up as trust in public officials declines.\n\"They recognize that they are some of the most trusted voices in society right now,\" Sonnenfeld told CNNMoney. \"It's absolutely critical that they use that platform.\"\nSonnenfeld said he received emails from more than a dozen leading CEOs on Monday reacting to Frazier's statement -- and especially Trump's broadside.\n\"This has really hit a nerve -- attacking this great CEO,\" Sonnenfeld said.\nBusiness Roundtable, a powerful lobby group of CEOs that advocate for tax reform, put out a statement condemning the violence in Virginia. The organization is chaired by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon.\n\"America's business leaders are shocked at the violence that took place in Charlottesville, and we mourn the unnecessary loss of life. Racism has no place in our businesses, our communities or our country,\" the statement said.\nRelated: CEOs condemn racism after Charlottesville\nSonnenfeld predicted more corporate leaders \"across sectors and across party\" will come out against Trump.\nIt's a stunning reversal considering the euphoria among business leaders following Trump's election. A JPMorgan Chase survey published in February found that 76% of executives believed the new administration would help their businesses. Just 12% said they expected it to hurt.\nThe stock market soared as Wall Street cheered the administration's economic agenda. While stocks keep rising, market analysts say the recent gains have been driven more by corporate profits and economic growth than Trump's policies.\nAt the same time, CEOs have become frustrated with Trump's inability to get his tax, infrastructure, health care or deregulation plans through Congress.\nA stunning 50% of the CEOs, executives, government officials and academics surveyed at the Yale CEO Summit in June gave Trump an \"F\" for his first 130 days in office. Just 1% gave him an \"A.\""}

Having said that, marketers are still scratching their heads over the use of the platform to advertise their products or services. Film marketing, which has been pretty run-of-the-mill, grapples with the same challenge. Fox Star Studios, the Indian arm of Murdoch's 20th Century Fox, is attempting to innovate on the virtual platform to engage audiences. Starting with Baaghi 2 (release date March 30),the studio is using chatbots and gamificafion as parts of its strategy. \"With digital, we have the scope to access a lot of data. For the first time perhaps, we can track the consumer journey (of their interaction with the film) from the first point of contact to the purchase of ticket,\" says Shikha Kapur, chief marketing officer, FSS. Marketers are fast realising that likes and shares cannot always be the metric for effeciency of communication reach. There is therefore an attempt, across sectors, to use digital marketing going beyond likes, shares and retweets in order to gauge the stickiness of the content. This can be done by creating a two way communication path, rather than just bombarding viewers with videos and other promotional material and actually talking to them. Digital provides the avenue to do so. For the marketing for Baaghi 2 on digital, the team at FSS went back to the drawing board. The first task was to identify the audience loyal to the franchise.\" We shortlisted fans of action films, those who have seen Baaghi 1 and fans of Tiger Shroff. This was the audience we went after even in case of the promo release. I think our research gave us a catchment of 60-70 million digital audience,\" Kapur explains.\nThe targeted release of the promo online paid of in that the bounce rate on the promo was considerably lower. In other words, 50 per cent of the viewers clicking on the promo video saw it till the end. The end of the promo included a call to action for interested viewers to interact with the film online. A number flashed on the screen, giving a missed call to which would initiate a conversation with the on the platform.\nOnce on the chatbot, fans can interact with the movie through conversations that include trivia, quizzes and tasks. The gamification aspect comes from the awards linked with the tasks. Each task has points attached to it, which users can accrue over time. As the fan moves up on the leaderboard, they collect rewards which can be redeemed as per their convenience.\nKapur says that the strategy has paid off in that the chatbot has seen traction and is engaging fans of the franchise. \"In the run up to the release of the film, we'll ramp up the engagement and try and be part of the process of conversion (when the person actually makes the ticket person). It's the first time we've done something like this and we hope to adapt the chatbot to other titles which lend themselves well to digital engagement.\"\nThe strategy will be employed future titles from the FSS banner, and may even include language dubs of the Hollywood titles the studio distributes in India"}
{"id":"1c59a100-3f62-46dd-a658-e288f52435b0","text":"I like the improvements made by the company, but after shares have quadrupled in less than two years, I am cautious for now. Looking to buy at a sizeable dip.\nThis momentum is not sustainable in a very cyclical industry, although diversification, growth and reduced leverage may smooth out future swings.\nMicron Technology (MU) is a very hot stock again, supported by incredible strong operating performance. The company just released its fourth-quarter results which indicated that sales nearly doubled on an annual basis. This has a huge impact on the bottom line thanks to incredible operating leverage in the business model, which of course works both ways.\nThe company is taking measures to reduce the volatility and operating leverage of the business by reducing its net debt load, diversifying its business into other areas, and focusing on structural growth areas. While I can only approve these measures, the stock has priced in a great deal of good news as current earnings are not sustainable. On a significant setback, I might be inclined to buy into the structurally changed story, but for now, proceed with caution.\nVery Strong Momentum\nMicron posted a 91% increase in revenues in Q4 as revenues came in at $6.14 billion. Growth has been driven by all four business units as the largest computer & networking business was responsible for most of the growth. Revenues were up 128% in this segment to $2.85 billion, driven by cloud and data centres. Operating leverage was astonishing as operating margins improved 55 percentage points to 56% of sales!\nStorage revenues were up 72% to $1.30 billion driven by tighter conditions in the storage market. Operating margins of 19% are relatively low but improved remarkably from an 8% loss last year.\nMobile business revenues rose 76% to $1.18 billion as operating margins improved from -5% last year to a very respectable 31% on the back of NAND solutions being in demand. The embedded business unit, which focuses on home automation and automotive among others, saw revenues inch up 61% to $827 million, alongside operating margins of 42%.\nCompared to last year, revenues were up by $2.9 billion in absolute dollar terms to $6.1 billion. The +90% increase is largely driven by pricing amidst tighter market conditions as gross profits were up by $2.6 billion at the same time, talk about operating leverage! With operating earnings coming in at $2.50 billion, Micron was able to post fat after-tax profits of $2.37 billion thanks to a small tax benefit as the result of past losses and favourable tax arrangements in Taiwan and Singapore.\nFinances Are Improving\nMicron is adding to its cash balances thanks to the superior profitability in recent months. Cash holdings jumped to $6.0 billion as total debt had been reduced to $11.1 billion, for a $5.1 billion net debt load. With EBITDA totalling $3.5 billion in the fourth-quarter alone, it is safe to say that leverage is not an issue at this moment. It is furthermore quite common for the company to operate with some financial leverage given the capital intensity of the business, although it remains a highly cyclical business at the same time of course.\nOn top of the $2.6 billion deal to acquire Inotera, Micron continues to invest into the business itself. It should be said that net capital spending only totalled $1.3 billion last year as $5.3 billion in capital spending has been offset by $4 billion in depreciation charges.\nWith the earnings power hitting $1.99 per share in Q4 and coming in at $4.41 per share for the year, it can be argued that shares are cheap. Year to date, shares have already nearly doubled to $40 per share, but if one were to annualize the Q3 results, earnings multiples would still look highly appealing. That is very misleading, however. While Micron caters real growth industries, its business is incredibly volatile or at least has been in the past.\nWhat Can Sustainable Margins Look Like?\nMicron's operating margins surpassed 40% in the most recent quarter and these kind of margins are clearly unsustainable. Looking at the past ten years, gross margins have on average come in at 18%, as operating margins have on average barely came in above the flat line.\nThe company has benefited from structural growth as sales have risen from +$5 billion to $20 billion this year, as the market has structurally become more profitable following consolidation. The question is how much the profitability has structurally improved. Operating margins came in at 18-19% in 2014\/2015 on revenues of $16 billion as sales hit a high of $35 per share in response to the earnings explosion. Shares plunged to $10 in 2016 as revenues fell to $12 billion while the company essentially broke even. Operating margins approached 30% in this fiscal year and hit 40% in the most recent quarter, as it seems safe to say that this is unsustainable.\nIf we assume that 20% margins are more sustainable on average on a $20 billion run-rate, operating profits hit an average of $4 billion a year. With interest costs amounting to half a billion, and effective tax rates were seen at just 10-20%, net earnings are seen around $3 billion at a sustainable rate. That works out to roughly $2.50 per share, based on the diluted share count. That translates into sustainable multiples of 16 times, for a business which benefits from long-term tailwinds, but is incredibly cyclical.\nThe problem is that earnings multiples look cheap now based on superior profits which drive the shares higher. When the cycle turns and the company is posting losses, the outlook is dismal given the financial leverage employed.\nTo offset the latter concern going into the future, the company might potentially target a flat net debt position by the end of next year. As a result, timing is everything for Micron and its investors, as the company sees large increased in DRAM and NAND supply in the coming quarters, in a move which will probably pressure margins. Samsung and SK Hynix have announced capacity increases in response to the tight market conditions.\nFinal Thoughts\nFrom the discussion above, it might be clear that I am not a buyer of shares at the moment. This is even the case as the company is guiding for first quarter results for 2018 to surpass those of the most recent quarter. As such, another $2-$2.5 billion might be added to the cash balances of Micron in the coming months.\nUsing my \"sustainable\" $2.50 per share earnings potential, accounting for reduced cyclicality and exposure to long-term growth markets, I am appealed to the business. The downside is that shares have quadrupled in a straight line over the past 18 months.\nShares traded at $27 as recent as of August, but I do not expect that a correction could pull back shares to these levels anytime soon. If shares see a decent correction towards the $30-35 region, I might be inclined to initiate a small position and average down from there. The aim to reduce leverage going forward, diversification of the business, and focus on structurally growing markets might reduce cyclicality of earnings going forwards, as earnings are expected to remain volatile nonetheless.\nMicron is a dangerous short despite the move higher on the back of earnings power, but at some point, margin contraction will arrive. The question is when and by how much, as I am not inclined to join the momentum run at this point.\nDisclosure: I\/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."}

It is based on the most accurate and up-to-date information from your Department. Your Department confirmed this to me in writing on Wednesday June 6 and we then reached final agreement on the report on Friday June 8.\n\u201cIt is odd that by Friday June 15 you felt able to say that the NAO \u2018did not take into account the impact of our recent changes\u2019.\n\u201cYou reiterated these statements on July 2 but we have seen no evidence of such impacts nor fresh information.\u201d\nSir Amyas Morse\u2019s open letter to Esther McVey (National Audit Office)\nSir Amyas added: \u201cYour statement on July 2 that the NAO was concerned Universal Credit is currently \u2018rolling out too slowly\u2019 and needs to \u2018continue at a faster rate\u2019 is also not correct.\u201d\nMs McVey returned to the Commons on Wednesday to issue her apology.\n\u201cI mistakenly said that the NAO had asked for the rollout of Universal Credit to continue at a faster rate and to be speeded up.\n\u201cIn fact, the NAO did not say that.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cWhat I meant to say was that the NAO had said that there was no practical alternative to continuing with Universal Credit.\u201d\nBut she stood by her claim that the NAO had not been able to examine the impact of recent changes.\n\u201cThe impact of these changes are still being felt and therefore, by definition, couldn\u2019t have been fully taken into account by the NAO report,\u201d she told MPs\nShadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said Ms McVey was either \u201cincompetent\u201d or had lied to MPs and should quit.\nShe said: \u201cThe NAO report is damning about the roll-out of Universal Credit, the Government\u2019s flagship welfare programme.\n\u201cIf she didn\u2019t read it properly, that\u2019s incompetence. If she did read it properly and knowingly misled Parliament, then she should resign.\u201d\nMark Serwotka, the general secretary of the PCS public service union, said: \u201cThe apology from the minister will do nothing to convince those using Universal Credit, or our members who administer it, that the scheme works.\n\u201cThe fact that the Auditor General has felt the need to make a public statement that the minister\u2019s claims that Universal Credit is working are not \u2018proven\u2019 is a damning indictment.\n\u201cOur members want to work in a humane social security system which helps claimants get the support they need.

(Matthew Weber \/ Pioneer Press)\nMatchups between Park and South St. Paul never disappoint.\nIn 2015, Park beat South St. Paul 28-27 when the Wolfpack defense stopped the Packers on a two-point attempt with a minute to play.\nIn 2016, the Packers beat Park 29-26 on a final goal in the game\u2019s final seconds.\nAnd Friday night\u2019s game might\u2019ve been the best yet, as Park held on to beat South St. Paul 40-39 in overtime as, much like in 2015, the Wolfpack defense ended the game with a stop on a Packers\u2019 two-point attempt, knocking down a pass to secure victory.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what it is between the two teams,\u201d Park coach Darin Glazier said of the thrillers. \u201cI think we\u2019re pretty evenly matched each time and it comes down to who makes the big plays and who makes mistakes. It\u2019s just been such a fantastic series with these guys.\u201d\nGlazier was hesitant to give away his strategy for that final defensive stand, thinking he might need to protect his thought process for the next chapter in what\u2019s become an epic saga.\n\u201cI sure enjoy it,\u201d he said of the series, \u201cbut I think I aged 10 years tonight.\u201d\nPark\u2019s final stop Friday prevented what would have been a devastating defeat for Park, who led 33-17 with seven minutes to play after quarterback Grant Glazier, Darin\u2019s son, ran in a three-yard score.\nBut South St. Paul rallied with 16 points in the game\u2019s final five minutes, scoring two touchdowns and converting both two-point conversions with a successful onside kick sandwiched in between. Packers\u2019 quarterback Cade Sexauer scored on a quarterback sneak on fourth-and-goal from the one-yard line on the final play of regulation, then converted the two-point conversion with a pass to a wide-open Nathan Brandecker to tie the game and silence a Park crowd that assumed the game was over minutes earlier.\n\u201cI felt kind of devastated,\u201d Grant Glazier said.\nDarin Glazier said he felt bad for his defense after surrendering the lead. That unit was on the field all evening as South St. Paul amassed 464 yards of offense on 60 plays while controlling the clock and the line of scrimmage. Three Packers\u2019 rushers tallied 99-plus yards. But Park\u2019s defense made a big play when it needed to, which was the theme of the night.\nOn the game\u2019s opening drive, South St. Paul was clinical in marching down inside the Park 20-yard line. But the Wolfpack (4-2) pounced on a Packers\u2019 mistake, as Grant Glazier scooped up a fumble and returned it 88 yards for a touchdown to put the Wolfpack up 6-0.\nSouth St. Paul (4-2) was forced to punt on its following drive, and the kick was blocked by Jaeden Stovall to give the Wolfpack the ball on the South St. Paul 15-yard line. Two plays later, Glazier found Charlie Gorres for a 13-yard scoring strike to make it 13-0 Park.\nUnforced errors haunted South St. Paul throughout.\n\u201cWe shot ourselves in the foot a lot,\u201d said Cade Sexauer, the son of Packers coach Chad Sexauer. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot better South St. Paul team that what played tonight.\u201d\nPark\u2019s offense only played 11 snaps in the first half, compared to 37 for South St. Paul, yet the Wolfpack led 13-10 at half. The Wolfpack offense got rolling in the third quarter. Uriah Davis scored on a 28-yard rush, then Glazier passed to Gorres again for a seven-yard touchdown to make it 27-10 Park.\nIncluding his overtime rushing touchdown, Glazier tallied five scores Friday \u2013 two passing, two rushing and one on the fumble return \u2013 a special performance on senior night with his dad on the sideline.\n\u201cAnytime I see him running into the end zone with the ball, I can say I\u2019m pretty dang proud,\u201d Darin Glazier said.\nFriday\u2019s matchup provided a rarity with each team\u2019s quarterback being the son of the head coach. Darin Glazier said the two coaches know each other well, and the two quarterbacks have been good friends since they were little.\n\u201cWhat way to finish that relationship for football,\u201d Darin said. \u201cThat was pretty cool.\u201d"}

I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gone wrong. Either it has lost touch with me, or I with it. But it does not speak to the world in which I grew up, or the values held over a lifetime.\nBut there is one glorious, inspiring, floriferous exception \u2013 one that to me serves as a model of how we could make life in Scotland better. And it starts in our gardens. So step forward Jim McColl, Carole Baxter, Chris Beardshaw and George Anderson \u2013 heroes of BBC Scotland\u2019s weekly gardening mainstay, The Beechgrove Garden.\nWhat? A gardening programme as a Scottish exemplar? Often filmed in the cold and wet of Aberdeenshire? With a couthy Jim McCall up to his arms in plant pots and top soil? Surely no match for Monty Don, that Jolly Green Giant of Gardeners World?\nBut there is scarcely a better or more inspiring example today of how to apply Scottish solutions to Scottish problems \u2013 ever instructive, always relevant and forever inspiring. In a world of verbal dross and the wayward vanities of the bien pensant, here is a beacon that should serve as a guide in many other areas of Scottish life.\nWhat you will not find in The Beechgrove Garden is as good a guide to its virtues as to what\u2019s on show. There\u2019s none of the ridiculous over-the-top \u2018Grand Designs\u2019 of the Chelsea Flower Show \u2013 a surreal absurdity over which the BBC drooled for the best part of a week. It dribbled and burled over fantastical constructs far removed from domestic conditions: fabrications costing hundreds of thousands of pounds to assemble and far beyond the reach of ordinary mortals.\nBy contrast The Beechgrove Garden, hosted by the incomparable Jim McColl, is a real garden with real problems \u2013 and real weather conditions \u2013 showing us how to plant and nurture plants in Scottish conditions.\nYou are not left with a feeling of utter defeat because the camera has lingered over some multi-acre reconstruction of the gardens of Malmaison. This year\u2019s award winners at Chelsea inflicted a similar sense of utter helplessness and futility.\nREAD MORE: 8 trends to look out for at Gardening Scotland\nThe top award winner was a simulated Yorkshire garden complete with stone bothy and cheese-making facility within. Smoke drifted gently from its chimney. Giant earth movers were deployed to recreate a Yorkshire Dales Dingly Dell complete with babbling burn, and nearby, yes, I do not make this up, an authentic Yorkshire cowpat. Ridiculous or what? The area around the cowpat had been carefully lifted and the item borne to London with all the care attending the movement of a priceless artefact from the tomb of Tutankhamun. How the judges drooled. Had they gone truly mad? Next was another money-no-object exhibit: a South African cape winery complete with \u201cauthentic\u201d Cape Dutch house and local plants borne thousands of miles from the Karroo to pretend they could be a natural addition to a UK garden. At least we were spared the defecations of roving impala and galloping wildebeest. A Huguenot winery, interspersed with Protea? Here in northern European conditions? Is there anyone in Scotland who didn\u2019t double up laughing?\nWhat next? Perhaps Chelsea could invite the Grand Designs housebuilding guru Kevin McCloud to submit a Ludwig Mies van der Rohe high-rise made of waving bamboo and exotic oriental grasses. There\u2019s nothing here that half a million could not rustle up with the full embrace of the local planning authority, hearty endorsement of the historic buildings inspectorate, obliging approval from the fire safety regulator and a green vicar conferring the ultimate absurdity: the \u201cBlessing of Sustainability\u201d.\nA similar cavalier approach to verisimilitude can mar an otherwise outstanding BBC Gardeners World programme \u2013 when it\u2019s not knocked off the air for a snooker marathon. Here is Monty Don, advancing towards the camera with his perfect, shiny Farrow & Ball spade and perfect plant from the RHS. The glistening spade plunges into perfect, loamy, weed-free, stone-free compost \u2013 earth that must surely have been delivered just beforehand from Fortnum & Mason. Into this, Monty slides his glistening spade to plant a shrub. Easy! Perfect result in 30 seconds! As free of effort as his two drooping Labradors, adding that touch of languid authenticity.\nREAD MORE: Helen Martin: Gardeners of the World unite against sport in TV wars\nReally? Now I have worked in many gardens. And, like millions of others, the reality is baked-hard ground riddled with stones and builders\u2019 rubble, weed-packed and overgrown with ground elder. The bed requires a pick axe to break up \u2013 I have two of those for my garden in Lochearnhead, one already bent and the other blunted. Digging out the ground elder is an afternoon\u2019s work alone and is invariably a failed mission as the plant pops up again within days.\nLittle of this is evident in those soft-focused cameos of Monty\u2019s perfect gardens, more often than not filmed in the Cotswolds. Oh, no \u2013 not the Cotswolds again! Do BBC gardeners live anywhere else? Little wonder that the programme that sets me and thousands of Scottish gardeners alight is The Beechgrove Garden.\nBeechgrove is and always has been, as its website declares, \u201ca firmly practical, get-your-hands-dirty gardening programme which delights in success but also learns from failures in the garden and never takes itself too seriously\u201d.\nThanks to its advice, and despite the long winter and wet conditions of Loch Earn, the garden has pulled through, with stunning lilac and apple blossom this year, and more than 60 roses now in bud.\nWe can make our Scottish gardens \u2013 and our Scottish towns and villages \u2013 so much more attractive with practical, positive, down-to-earth solutions that the programme regularly presents. Nurseries are well stocked with resilient plants that put on a great show in challenging Scottish conditions. Villages such as Comrie in Perthshire work hard at displays, hanging gardens and green seating areas that help attract locals and visitors alike.\nIt is not easy work. It requires effort and patience. But the results can uplift the spirit and show our localities to best effect. Step aside, the Scottish Growth Commission! The Beechgrove Garden, with a growth commission of its own, offers practical, real-world solutions to hand. Long may it bloom."}

When the DUP back \u2013 and, crucially, influence \u2013 the Conservative government\u2019s position on the economy, on public spending, on welfare, this will almost certainly lead to political debate on Northern Ireland around those issues.\nThis is good for those of us who believe in the normalisation of our politics.\nAnd it is in the interests of the entire UK. It ensures that the largest party in the House of Commons \u2013 and the largest by a significant distance \u2013 can form a government at a crucial time for our country.\nDespite the ridiculous criticism of the Conservative-DUP arrangement by left-wing opinion, it seems obvious that DUP influence will ensure that the Conservatives govern from the pragmatic centre rather than the Right on a range of issues \u2013 particularly welfare and public spending. And on Brexit, the DUP\u2019s influence will lead to a more pragmatic deal.\nLet\u2019s also remember that the DUP are now backing a governing party which introduced equal civil marriage in England.

Labour happily regard the anti-abortion SDLP as a sister party. Sinn Fein\u2019s eagerness to enter coalition government in Dublin is hardly a secret.\nIt\u2019s also a bit rich for an abstentionist party to criticise another party for its MPs actually doing real work in Westminster.

{"id":"836cd20b-cc2b-4733-ab0e-af2ef48f9b41","text":"Though the memory chip market might seem like an investing backwater, it\u2019s actually one of the more interesting, dynamic areas of tech investing.\nContinue Reading Below\nThanks to the market\u2019s fierce competition, the companies that make memory chips, especially pure-play names like Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU), tend to trade in boom-and-bust cycles that can lead to massive gains or losses for shareholders, depending on the exact timing of their investment.\nHowever, finding the memory industry\u2019s best dividend name is a far simpler task since there is only one company tied to this space that also rewards its shareholders with cash distributions: Samsung (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF). In this article, we will review Samsung\u2019s memory business and examine its potential as a dividend stock.\nSamsung and the memory market\nThe largestmanufacturer of memory storage globally, Samsung\u2019s semiconductor sub-segment is arguably the crown jewel of its electronics empire, and memory likely drives the bulk of its chip business\u2019 performance. Let\u2019s dig a bit deeper to get a more precise sense of why memory matters to Samsung.\nFor those unfamiliar with the company\u2019s financial structure, the Korean electronics juggernaut organizes its operations around three main reporting segments: Consumer Electronics (CE), IT & Mobile communications (IM), and Devices Solutions (DS). Device Solutions includes Samsung\u2019s memory businesses. Importantly, sales of memory chips accounted for the largest portions of DS sales in 2016, and their 10% year-over-year growth rate was the highest among any segment or sub-segment at the company.\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\nHere\u2019s a quick snapshot into Samsung\u2019s financial performance in 2016 (in South Korean Won).\nImage source: Samsung.\nLooking to memory\u2019s impact on its bottom line, Samsung doesn\u2019t break out the sub-segment\u2019s results in its discussions of operating profits. However, a bit of back-of-the-envelope analysis suggests that memory sales provide about a quarter of Samsung\u2019s income from operations.\nIn referencing the charts above, we can see that memory chips accounted for 37 trillion Korean Won in revenue in 2016. Borrowing the net income margin from rival Micron Technology \u2014 which derives all of its revenue from the sale of memory devices \u2014 we know Micron generated a 22% profit marginin its most recent quarter. Applying Micron\u2019s profit margin to Samsung\u2019s 2016 memory sales implies that Samsung generated about 8.3 trillion Korean Won in operating profits from its memory business last year, or about 28% of its total operating profits. Though certainly imperfect, this suggests that memory is indeed an important profit center at Samsung \u2014 and one that helps power the company\u2019s dividend payments to its shareholders.\nImage source: Samsung.\nSamsung as a dividend stock\nSamsung might not seem like an appealing dividend stock, given that its 1.6% dividend currently sits below the 1.9% yieldof the S&P 500. That being said, Samsung\u2019s dividend payments appear poised to meaningfully increase in the year to come for a few reasons.\nAs I detailed in another recent article, Samsung recently found itself in the crosshairs of activist hedge fund firm Elliot Management, which had lobbied the Korean conglomerate to split itself into two separate publicly traded businesses. Rather than agreeing to do so, Samsung sought to quell the shareholder insurrection by pledging to increase the amount of capital it returns to shareholders, which will rise to about 50% of free cash flow this year, according to the company.\nThough I couldn\u2019t find free-cash-flow estimates for Samsung, sell-side analysts expect its sales and earnings per share (EPS) to increase by 9% and 72% respectively this year, according to data from Reuters. Though not scientific, this strongly suggests that the overall direction of Samsung\u2019s cash distributions are likely to increase, offering more appealing income generation than today\u2019s paltry yield certainly suggests.\nAt the end of the day, the memory chip space is far from an income investor\u2019s paradise. However, Samsung\u2019s robust memory business and its public pledges to increase the amount of capital it will return to shareholders indeed make it a compelling option among tech dividend stocks today.\n10 stocks we like better than Samsung\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

And, honestly, it went very well. He was quick. He did some long runs, he did some short runs, he did qualifying, we did race simulations and it all went very well.\"\nAsked if he thought Kubica could make a successful return to the sport, the Briton replied: \"From what I've seen from the statistics, from the data, the pace is there. That's for sure.\"\nHowever, with a word of caution, he added: \"On that Tuesday in Valencia he did a fantastic job. However, there are many other circuits, and whether he has physical limitations on those, only he knows at the moment. If it needs to go any further, that would be the next step.\"\nAsked about the secrecy surrounding the test, Permane explained: \"We did not want to create a big media storm. We knew, once it got out, everyone would be interested. Everybody loves Robert, everybody feels very sad for what happened.\n\"He was very calm about it,\" he continued. \"He had no problem with telling people.\n\"I didn't want to put a lot of pressure on him,\" he admitted. \"I just wanted it to be a day for him, without any expectation, any pressure, just for him to drive.\"\nAsked if Renault might give the Pole further tests, Permane admitted: \"I think it's too early to comment.\n\"We've been in touch,\" he continued, \"we've been talking about anything possible we might do in the future. But at the moment there is nothing else planned, I can say that much at the moment. But I wouldn't say we won't do something again in the future.\n\"I know he's driven some simulators,\" he added, \"maybe that is something we will be thinking about for the future. That might be the next step, is to go into the (Enstone) simulator.\"\nSpeaking at the weekend, Kubica made clear that a \"proper comeback\" is his dream.\n\"I don't know what it will bring,\" he told Sky Sports of the Valencia test, \"but definitely it's a nice feeling to know I can drive an F1 car after such a difficult period and having my limitations.\n\"To know I can drive the car and I can drive the car at a good pace and for an entire grand prix distance is something which makes me happy and proud,\" he added.\n\"I would like to test more,\" he admitted. \"It doesn't depend only on my side, but I will keep working and hopefully one day I will have a chance to go forward and step-by-step maybe have a proper comeback.\""}

His business has generated more than $1 billion in annual sales, according to the Wall Street Journal. His clients include billionaires Steve Cohen and David Geffen. Koons became the most expensive American artists at auction in 2013 when his 10-foot-tall stainless steel sculpture, Balloon Dog, fetched $58 million at Christie\u2019s. That record was smashed last year by Jean-Michel Basquiat\u2019s $110.5 million painting at Sotheby\u2019s.\nRepresentatives of Koons and the gallery didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\nTananbaum says the gallery and the artist persuade collectors to remit an initial deposit of $1 million to $2 million, along with additional payments of the same amount. They promise delivery of sculptures on a given date, only to delay completion by six months to a year, he claims.\nSIGN CONTRACTS\nOnce collectors sign contracts with Koons, they are no longer able to find out how they will get the sculptures or whether they are in production, \u201cwhile being besieged by a blizzard of installment payments,\u201d according to the complaint. The defendants resort to \u201cfaux science\u201d to explain delays, including difficulties with Computer-Aided Design processes used to make the sculptures, Tananbaum claims.\nThe suit was filed over three Koons sculptures that Tananbaum claims were not delivered: Ballon Venus Hohlen Fels (Magenta), also known as Balloon Venus, Eros and Diana. Tananbaum says the defendants prioritized other works over the three sculptures, including another sculpture, Gazing Ball (Centaur and Lapith Maiden), that was delivered to him in 2016 after he sued another gallery.\nGagosian has faced legal claims over Koons\u2019 work before. He was sued in 2012 by billionaire Ron Perelman, who accused Gagosian of tricking him into buying a $4 million Koons sculpture named Popeye. The suit was dismissed in 2014. More recently, the gallery was involved in a legal battle over a Pablo Picasso sculpture Bust of a Woman with the royal family of Qatar, which was settled in 2016. \u2014 Bloomberg"}

Crossing the road, he fired several shots at a 22-year old man who was a passenger in a car, killing him. Herman then took at least one woman hostage at a nearby school. When police closed in, he ran out onto the sidewalk firing and police fatally shot him. Four officers were wounded.\nHe yelled \u201cAllahu akbar,\u201d the Arabic phrase for God is great, several times during Tuesday\u2019s rampage, prosecutors said.\nThe attack has shaken Belgium where police and military have been working overtime to guard public buildings for two years since coordinated suicide attacks on the Brussels airport and subway system killed 32 people and injured hundreds on March 22, 2016.\nAdvertisement\nBelgian federal magistrate Wenke Roggen said Wednesday that the attack was considered \u201cterrorist murder and attempted terrorist murder.\u201d She said it\u2019s being treated as terrorism given the way Herman acted, which she says resembled Islamic State calls via video to attack police with knives and steal their weapons, the fact that he yelled \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d and was in contact with radicalized people.\nAn investigating magistrate specializing in terrorism has ordered autopsies on those killed at the scene and a toxicology examination of the attacker.\nProsecutors said Herman has had several run-ins with police since he was a minor. He has been sentenced on assault, drug and insubordination charges. He left prison early Monday on furlough and should have returned Tuesday evening.\nEarlier, Interior Minister Jan Jambon confirmed that Herman had already killed another person the day before the attack.\nJambon also said that the woman he took hostage may have talked the shooter down and helped to avoid more deaths inside the school.\n\u201cHe also committed a murder the night before,\u201d Jambon told broadcaster RTL. Jambon confirmed that the fourth victim was a former inmate who did prison time with Herman. Herman is alleged to have killed the man on Monday evening by hitting him over the head with a blunt object.\nJambon, Prime Minister Charles Michel and King Philippe visited the woman in hospital, where she was being treated for shock.\n\u201cShe was very courageous and perhaps, but this we will have to verify, she helped avoid more victims in the school,\u201d Jambon said.\nThe minister said an investigation has been launched into the incident, including the circumstances surrounding his release from prison.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really an isolated case. He wasn\u2019t part of a network, he didn\u2019t receive instructions from anyone else, so there is no need to raise the terror threat alert level,\u201d Jambon said, adding that investigators have no precise information that any other attacks might be likely.\nAmid questions about how two officers could have been disarmed, Jambon praised the work of all involved, saying \u201cthe police did an extraordinary job.\u201d\n\u201cThey reacted well. All the systems, all the procedures worked. But if you are attacked from behind, as was the case with the two officers, you can\u2019t do anything,\u201d he said.\nThe police officers have been identified as Soraya Belkacemi, 44, and Lucile Garcia, 54. The passenger in the car was named as Cyril Vangriecken, 22, who was preparing to become a primary school teacher.\nBelgian media reports named the man killed before Tuesday\u2019s rampage as Michael Wilmet.\nIn Liege, flags were flying at half-staff on public buildings and people gathered to sign a book of condolences and lay flowers in memory of the victims. The prime minister joined others at the scene in a minute\u2019s silence.\n\u201cEvery morning I am scared that something like this will happen, and every day it happens closer to home,\u201d Melissa Lamny told The Associated Press after wrapping flowers around a lamppost at the scene of the killings.\nMark Carlson and Sylvain Plazy in Brussels, and Bishr Eltouni in Liege, contributed to this report."}

The distance-based tolls range from $1.77 to $4.56 each way for cars and motorbikes, or $5.30 to $13.67 for trucks and other heavy vehicles.\nThe Traffic Management Centre said there was a noticeable increase in traffic on Parramatta Road on Tuesday.\n\"There was definitely a bit more on Parramatta Road \u2013 there is no doubt about it,\" a spokesman said. \"This is new and people are trying to settle in. It's going to take a while to get into its groove.\"\nHowever, he said the widened M4 was \"offering a great run\" for those motorists willing to pay the new tolls.\nThe 7.5-kilometre section of the M4 between Parramatta and Homebush has been widened at a cost of about $500 million from three to four lanes in each direction as part of the first stage of the $16.8 billion WestConnex motorway project.\nAdvertisement\nMotorists' response to the tolls over the coming months will be the first test for the 33-kilometre WestConnex, the final stage of which is due to be completed by 2024.\nThe business case for the project forecast higher weekday traffic on sections of Parramatta Road west of Homebush in 2031 with WestConnex than without.\nSHARE\nShare on Facebook SHARE\nShare on Twitter TWEET\nLink The sun rises on Sydney's new-old toll road, the M4 between Parramatta and Homebush, on Tuesday. Photo: Nick Moir\nHowever, it predicted a significant decline in traffic on much of Parramatta Road east of Strathfield by 2031 as a result of the first stage of WestConnex.\nTolls were removed from the M4 in 2010, and the government has justified their reintroduction by saying they will go towards paying for WestConnex.\nLabor transport spokeswoman Jodi McKay said motorists were taking Parramatta Road to avoid a toll that should not have been imposed.\n\"We will be campaigning right up to the next election on this because this toll should not be on the M4. You can't put a toll on a road that is not new,\" she said. \"Motorists will use Parramatta Road because they don't want to pay a $4.56 toll each way.\"\nMs McKay said Labor wanted to see funding earmarked for the proposed Beaches Link to Sydney's north-east being used to pay for the widened M4, instead of tolls.\nHowever, she said it did not oppose tolls on what she termed new parts of WestConnex, such as an extension of the M4 between Homebush and Haberfield.\nWestConnex Minister Stuart Ayres said drivers were expected to test other roads when the tolls started on the M4, which was what occurred on the M7, the Eastern Distributor and the Lane Cove and Cross City tunnels under Labor.\n\"The M4 needs to be widened and extended to link up with City West Link and WestConnex is doing this,\" he said.\n\"Labor has ignored this challenge for 20 years. The government is simply doing what Labor couldn't do.\"\nMr Ayres said Labor did not believe WestConnex could be funded without tolls, which was why the opposition had not committed to removing them.\nLike the rest of WestConnex, the distance-based tolls will rise each year at the rate of inflation or 4 per cent, whichever is greater.\nAt present, it means that tolls on the widened M4 will be rising at twice the rate of inflation and, in an era of low wage growth, resulting in a greater proportion of motorists' income being funnelled into paying for the right to drive on it."}

Using these data, researchers fine-tuned estimates from previous foram studies that captured polar conditions to show tropical oceans warmed substantially in the Eocene, but not as much as polar oceans.\nImportantly, when modern climate models \u2013 the same as those used in the United Nations\u2019 recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports \u2013 were run under Eocene conditions, many could not replicate these findings. Instead, the models consistently underestimated polar ocean warming in the Eocene.\nThis discrepancy may result from a gap in our understanding of the climate system or from what we know about the Eocene, said David Evans, the study\u2019s lead author and Leverhulme Research Fellow at the University of St Andrews\u2019 School of Earth and Environmental Sciences. If it does indeed relate to the climate system, it raises the possibility that predictions of future polar warming are also too low.\n\u201cYes, the tropics are warming but nowhere near to the same degree as the polar regions,\u201d Evans said. \u201cThat\u2019s something we really need to be able to understand and replicate in climate models. The fact that many models are unable to do that at the moment is worrying.\u201d\nThe researchers published their findings this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nScientists frequently look to the Eocene to understand how the Earth responds to higher levels of carbon dioxide. During the Eocene, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was more than 560 parts per million, at least twice preindustrial levels, and the epoch kicked off with a global average temperature more than 8 degrees Celsius \u2013 about 14 degrees Fahrenheit \u2013 warmer than today, gradually cooling over the next 22 million years. These characteristics make the Eocene a good period on which to test our understanding of the climate system, said Cotton, study co-author and curator of micropaleontology at the Florida Museum of Natural History.\nOne of the challenges has been accurately determining the difference between sea surface temperatures at the poles and the equator during the Eocene, with models predicting greater differences than data suggested.\nThe research team used large bottom-dwelling forams as \u201cpaleothermometers\u201d to gain a more precise temperature reading. Forams have an exceptionally long fossil record, spanning more than 540 million years, and they are often well-preserved in ocean sediments. Most are small enough to fit into the eye of a needle \u2013 Cotton describes them as \u201can amoeba with a shell\u201d \u2013 but they were so abundant during the Eocene that there are entire rocks composed of them.\n\u201cIf you look at the pyramids, they\u2019re full of these tiny little lentil-like things \u2013 those are forams,\u201d Cotton said. \u201cThe ancient Greeks thought the pyramids were made from the fossilized lentils of slaves, but it\u2019s just the limestone from one of these deposits that is absolutely filled with them.\u201d\nForams form their shells in concert with ocean temperatures and chemistry, acting as miniscule time capsules, each containing a precise record of the temperature and ocean chemistry during its lifetime. Their shells are primarily made of calcium, carbon and oxygen. Heavy isotopes of carbon and oxygen bond together as a foram makes its shell \u2013 the cooler the temperature, the more they bond to each other.\nBy analyzing these clumped isotopes from fossil specimens found in India, Indonesia and Tanzania, the researchers could get an accurate reading of sea surface temperature across the tropics in the Eocene. They also lasered a small hole in each specimen to measure the amount of magnesium and calcium that vaporized, revealing the seawater chemistry.\nThey found that tropical sea surface temperature in the Eocene was about 6 degrees Celsius \u2013 about 10 degrees Fahrenheit \u2013 warmer than today.\n\u201cThis was the first time we had samples that were good enough and this method was well-known enough that it could all come together,\u201d Cotton said.\nThe team then used their dataset from the tropics to back-calculate the temperature and chemistry of polar oceans, relying on previous studies of forams that captured the conditions of those regions.\nWith this correction factor in place, they investigated the degree to which polar oceans warmed more than the tropics, a feature of the climate system known as polar amplification. Their data showed that the difference between polar and equatorial sea surface temperatures in the Eocene was an estimated 20 degrees Celsius, about 36 degrees Fahrenheit. Today the difference is 28 degrees Celsius, indicating that polar regions are more sensitive to increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide than the tropics.\nTroublingly, said Evans, when the team compared their data with various modern climate models under Eocene conditions, most models underestimated polar amplification by about 50 percent.\nThe two models that came closest to reproducing the team\u2019s data had one key aspect in common \u2013 they modified the way they accounted for cloud formation and the longevity of clouds in the atmosphere, particularly in the polar regions.\n\u201cTo us, that looks like a promising research direction,\u201d he said. \u201cIf \u2013 and it\u2019s a big if \u2013 that turns out to be the right avenue to go down, that could play into the models we use for our future climate predictions.\u201d\nThe research was supported by Yale University, the Yale Analytical and Stable Isotope Center, the Israel Science Foundation, the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research, a Natural Environment Research Council Capital Equipment Grant, the Research Foundation Flanders, the Netherlands Earth System Science Center and a Horizon 2020 grant.

Johnson. The resulting pursuit spilled over into Prattville, where the stolen vehicle struck a car head-on on McQueen Smith Road South in Prattville, Johnson said. Three people were in the car, a 2014 Volkswagen Jetta, he said.\nOn Sunday one of the victims of the crash, Jimmy S. Ward, 69 died, in a Montgomery hospital from injuries he received in the crash, Johnson said. The teens, a 14-year-old boy from Montgomery and a 15-year-old boy from Millbrook are charged with theft and felony attempting to elude a police officer, Johnson said. He did not release their names, due to their ages.\nThe other occupants of the Jetta, a 72-year-old man and a 69-year-old woman were injured and taken to Baptist Medical Center South for treatment, Johnson said.\nThe 14-year-old was allegedly driving the stolen car, a 2011 Nissan Maxima, the chief said. The teens were also treated for their injuries, the chief said. The 14-year-old is in the Montgomery County Youth Detention Facility, and the 15-year-old was released to his parents, he said.\nOther charges relating to Ward\u2019s death are likely coming, said Prattville Chief Mark Thompson. He said it\u2019s a \u201cjoint investigation,\u201d involving the Millbrook and Prattville police departments and the district attorney\u2019s office.\nNo charges from the wreck had been filed by 6 p.m. Monday. The chase went down Highway 14 into Prattville, Johnson said.\n\u201cThis is an absolutely senseless and horrible tragedy that occurred because of the selfish and foolish acts on the part of these two young men,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBased on witness statements and physical evidence there is no doubt that the two young men that were taken into custody stole the 2011 Nissan Maxima from a local business. When our officers attempted to stop the stolen vehicle, the driver decided to flee rather than stop and be apprehended. From what I understand, once the suspect vehicle turned onto McQueen Smith Road, they ran out of sight of the two officers that were following behind them due to excessive speed. Apparently the driver of the stolen vehicle lost control of the vehicle due to excessive speed, striking the curbing on the southbound traffic lane before crossing into the northbound or opposing traffic lane, where it collided with the second vehicle causing injury to the vehicle\u2019s occupants.\n\u201cChief Thompson and I agree that our agencies will work hand in hand on this case, as we always do. We intend on doing everything in our power to present the best case for the district attorney\u2019s office to prosecute and for the victim\u2019s family to get justice.\u201d\nRead or Share this story: http:\/\/on.mgmadv.com\/2pveMku"}

It was a really good, aggressive cross, to be fair, and it\u2019s gone in off Adam Matthews .\n\u201cThat\u2019s two games running [we have conceded just before half-time] and it is tough to take because you are getting beaten down all the time, things are going against you.\n\u201cYou can be forgiven for thinking that it is never going to turn, but it has to turn.\u201d\n(Image: Sunday Sun)\nSunderland should have gone in front inside 10 minutes, but teenager Joel Asoro missed the target from inside the six yard box.\nAnd the Black Cats also created other opportunities which they failed to convert.\nColeman said: At the start we did some good things, didn\u2019t get a goal, the opposition score and then everybody thinks \u2018here we go again\u2019.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same old situation, same old feeling.\n\u201cIt\u2019s trying shrug that negativity off, and it is down to us to do that.\n\u201cWe get into some lovely situations but we just let teams off the hook for whatever reason, be it lack of focus, lack of confidence, whatever.\n\u201cThat\u2019s quite aggravating.\n(Image: Sunderland AFC)\n\u201cThere\u2019s only us that can change our fortunes.\n\u201cWe have shown some good stuff to build on, but we have to stop letting teams off the hook.\n\u201cWe have to stop gifting teams goals because we never get easy goals, we have to work our socks off to get a goal, so why are we giving the opposition easy goals?\n\u201cWe have to stop doing that, otherwise we are never going to get away from where we are.\nColeman was in no mood to make excuses, but he did feel Sunderland should have had a penalty when sub George Honeyman\u2019s cross hit the arm of a defender in the second period, however referee Darren England was unmoved.\nHe said: \u201cIn the second half we tried, we looked na\u00efve in certain situations \u2013 Ipswich have a lot of boys who know the division and are streetwise.\n\u201cThen with 25 minutes to go we should have had a penalty \u2013 it has to be a penalty. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s why we lost the game, but make the decision.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a handball. If he was two or three yards away, I\u2019d say he couldn\u2019t get his hand out of the way, but he was 10 or 15 yards away.\n\u201cIt\u2019s handball, it\u2019s a penalty.\n\u201cWhether we would have scored it or not doesn\u2019t matter, it was a penalty and we didn\u2019t get it.\u201d"}

False news reached way more people than the truth; the top 1% of false news cascades diffused to between 1,000 and 100,000 people, whereas the truth rarely diffused to more than 1,000 people.

Use code ORM20 to save 20% on your conference pass (Gold, Silver, and Bronze passes).\nI recently sat down with Dinesh Dutt, chief scientist at Cumulus Networks, to discuss how data centers have changed in recent years, new tools and techniques for network engineers, and what the future may hold for data center networking. Here are some highlights from our talk.\nHow have data centers evolved over the past few years?\nModern data centers have come a long way from when I first began working on them in 2007. Pioneers such as Google and Amazon started a trend that many others now try to emulate.\nFirst, more people are embracing the Clos network topology and routing as the fundamental rubric of the modern data center. This is true of even conservative enterprises. The biggest impediment to making this change is having legacy applications that still assume bridging as the network interconnect, and assume broadcast and multicast as common application discovery and heartbeat mechanisms. Modern data centers have either entirely banished multicast or relegated it to a rack level service. And they charge more for these services on a larger scale.\nSecond, automation is more ubiquitously embraced as a mandatory requirement rather than a nice to have. While some are still unsure how to start, their desire for automation is clear and is evidenced by tools such as Ansible being enhanced to deal with automating networking equipment.\nThird, disaggregated solutions or white box switching, where the hardware and software are acquired separately from different vendors, is steadily gaining ground. Traditional vendors are starting to dip their toes into this pool, like server vendors did in the late 90s world of PCs and x86.\nAlong with disaggregated switches, people are starting to understand the logic, benefits and simplicity of fixed-form factor switches instead of large modular chassis.\nFrom an applications perspective, I see the rise of microservices and containers as a fast growing trend. People are pushing features such as security into the application instead of letting it be part of networking. Needless to say, some basic traffic isolation is still provided by networks, but not to the extent that older solutions prescribed.\nWhat are some of the traditional approaches to troubleshooting networks?\nTraditionally, network operators troubleshoot using tools such as ping and traceroute and open multiple terminal windows, each connected to a different node, to diagnose each box. In other words, they try to build a fabric-wide picture using a box-by-box approach. This traditional approach is still true of many modern data centers because of the dearth of tools in this area. Networking is still largely an appliance-based model rather than a platform model, preventing anybody but the vendor from developing the appropriate tools. Vendors are not operators and often lack the perspective of network operators.\nA network operator\u2019s life is not easy, and trends such as SDN have not really helped. While we have started automating configuration management, we have not gone much beyond that. Don\u2019t get me wrong; the largest data centers have modernized their network operations to extend automation beyond configuration, but not many others.\nWhen things go wrong, the network operator is typically manually running a checklist to troubleshoot the problem. We need to codify and automate network operations beyond just configuration.\nWhat are some of the new tools and techniques that network engineers should be aware of?\nPing and traceroute have started supporting multipathing, which is the availability of multiple paths to reach a destination and is a characteristic of modern data centers. There are also newer tools such as scamper that handle the presentation of information somewhat better than ping and traceroute. And large scale network operators use tools such as Pingmesh and Norad to quickly troubleshoot problems.\nBut it is the rise of open networking that has the greatest potential. I say this because system administrators have many tools to help identify problems, whereas network administrators have tools limited by SNMP. With Linux powering routers and switches, networking devices now offer an open platform that allows people to treat routers and switches much like servers that have many network interface cards. The accessibility of this type of platform empowers network administrators to develop their own breed of tools. Even simple metrics gathering is becoming possible without SNMP. But this area is immature and still developing. I have been working on a tool to help validate and troubleshoot networks that I\u2019ll cover in the talk I\u2019m giving at Velocity.\nWhat do you see as the future of data center networking?\nIn a single word: consilience. I see a world where network and compute (and storage) are managed similarly, with each leveraging the tools and expertise of the other domains. With an open platform powering each, we no longer have to solve the same problem twice (once for networking, and once for compute). Often, the two solutions are vastly different for no reason other than history. Computing was opened up when Linux replaced the proprietary server OSes; this changed the application landscape as we know it. I think solutions such as clouds and the Google search would have been harder to invent if not for the widespread use of Linux. For too long people have innovated around networks, not with them. If networking can be opened up as computing has been, and if people can innovate with the network rather than around it, I think networking and computing as we know it can change dramatically.\nYou\u2019re speaking at the O'Reilly Velocity Conference in San Jose this month. What presentations are you looking forward to attending while there?\nThere are a lot of interesting titles. The ones I\u2019m currently interested in are Lessons and best practices learned from monitoring next-generation infrastructure, Scheduling deep dive for orchestration systems, Building a skyscraper with Legos: The anatomy of a distributed system and The over-under on container networking."}

The Stars and Stripes neatly rolled up and attached to the gear of deployed military personnel. The red, white and blue standing in contrast with the muted colors of uniforms designed to conceal.\nWhy do they carry the flag? Whether it's being used to identify themselves to coalition fighter jets, mark territory claimed on the battlefield, or serve as a vivid and cherished memento, the American flag serves many a purpose among our forces down range.\n\u201cWe always carried a flag on the first operation in a new environment,\u201d retired Lt. Col. James Reese said.\nIt certainly adds context to those famous words written by Francis Scott Key: \" Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light.\"\nCurrently, there are more than 1.3 million active-duty personnel in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force and Coast Guard, according to the Department of Defense. The servicemen and women are spread among at least a dozen countries, including the United States itself.\n\"We always carried a flag on the first operation in a new environment.\" - Lieutenant Colonel James Reese, US Army (RET)\nSpecial Operations Forces (SOF), the elite units most often seen with the flag, are not nearly as numerous. According to U.S. Special Operations Command, there are just over 57,000 active-duty SOF fighters.\nOf that number, only about 8,300 are deployed across 90 countries. In 2017, the Defense Department moved more than 15 percent of the deployed SOF fighters to assist African militaries, up from just 1 percent the year prior. There are roughly 1,200 SOF soldiers deployed to about a dozen African countries.\nIn 2007, after 25 years of service, Reese retired as a commander in the elite Army unit known as Delta Force. He told Fox News that soldiers often carry flags in case communications break down and they need to identify themselves to friendly forces.\nThis becomes especially important when special operations units are fighting with a coalition of different nations\u2019 fighter jets providing support from on high. He called the flag a last ditch \u201cfar-recognition signal\u201d on the battlefield.\nIt\u2019s especially important for soldiers in places like Syria, where myriad nations provide air support but only a select few, including American fighters, are on the ground.\n\u201cFlags are carried so they can be put up when we occupy a new compound or fire base,\u201d said another active-duty Army first sergeant, who requested anonymity because of his continuing ongoing service.\nReese said soldiers have been given greater autonomy over their garb in recent years, as long as they satisfy the standard packing lists mandated by commanders. Usually, soldiers must carry more than 200 rounds of ammo, medical kits, MRE rations, a weapon cleaning kit and a map, to name a few items.\nWhen he was first in the Army Rangers in the 1980s, Reese said, all uniforms were disciplined and standardized, a practice that looked sharp but wasn\u2019t the most practical for every soldier.\nThis mindset changed after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Now, he said, military branches in the U.S. and abroad mimic the way Special Operation Forces prepare and fight.\n\u201cWhat soldiers look like now is what we looked like 12, 15 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cThe military has quickly caught on to different ways we wear our armor. \u2026 [We\u2019re] set up to be efficient.\u201d\nEfficiency of movement and mind is what Reese said kept him alive during his decades of service.

But every time the Giants rise up the standings, they seem to fall back to sea level.\nWith a defeat Tuesday, the Giants have lost consecutive games for the first time since June 15-16 against the Dodgers, which was also the last time the Giants have been held to two runs or fewer in back-to-back contests.\nRight-hander Chris Stratton took the mound Tuesday after the Giants announced several changes to their rotation to accommodate the upcoming returns of veterans Johnny Cueto and Jeff Samardzija.\nThough Bochy has praised Stratton for helping hold together the pitching staff during their absences, the Giants did not commit to announcing Stratton as the starter for next Monday\u0092s game against the Cubs, which is when his turn in the rotation comes up again.\n\u0093I certainly haven\u0092t helped myself out here recently,\u0094 Stratton said. \u0093I think they know what I can do and what I\u0092m capable of here so the decision is in their hands and you don\u0092t think about that, you just try to go out there and win a ballgame.\u0094\nStratton has been up at the major league level since August 2017, but the second-year right-hander could be on his way down to the minor leagues or back to the bullpen after rookies Andrew Su\u00e1rez and Dereck Rodr\u00edguez flashed impressive potential during an 18-win month of June for the Giants.\n\u0093My past two outings I\u0092ve given up a lot of hits and I guess it\u0092s both against those guys, but I need to continue to mix it up,\u0094 Stratton said.\nBack-to-back losses have brought the Giants down to earth at 45-42, but Rockies third baseman Nolan Arenado remains on cloud nine whenever he faces San Francisco.\nArenado appeared in his 100th career game against the Giants Tuesday and in the fifth inning, he launched his 24th career home run against the club to dead center field. His three-run shot extended the Rockies advantage to 6-0 in the fifth inning and brought his career total to 90 RBIs against Giants pitchers.\n\u0093It was down, but you\u0092ve got to tip your cap sometimes,\u0094 Stratton said of the pitch he threw to Arenado. \u0093He had a good swing there but I don\u0092t know, man. That was a weird one for him to be able to put that one out.\u0094\nThe Giants\u0092 inability to figure out Arenado, who will soon lock up his fourth career All-Star nod, isn\u0092t all that surprising considering the Rockies\u0092 best player continues to improve as he enters the prime of his career.\nWhat\u0092s more confounding is the Giants\u0092 struggles against a Rockies team that entered Tuesday\u0092s contest with the worst ERA in the National League.\nAfter the Giants managed just two runs in a 5-2 defeat Monday, Bochy\u0092s squad did not score against Rockies starter Antonio Sentazela Tuesday. Senzatela made his first major league start of the year against the Giants after facing their Triple-A squad, the Sacramento River Cats, last week.\nThe burly righty blanked Sacramento over 7 2\/3 innings Thursday and tossed seven frames of three-hit ball against San Francisco Tuesday. Though the Giants had won 15 of their last 18 games against right-handed starters, they couldn\u0092t maintain their success against Senzatela who now holds a 14 2\/3-inning scoreless streak against the organization.\n\u0093He was good, there\u0092s no question,\u0094 Bochy said. \u0093He\u0092s got great stuff. He\u0092s got that cutter along with the great fastball and you know, he\u0092s got the curveball now.\u0094\nThe Giants did scratch across a run on an Alen Hanson single in the eighth, but that was all they mustered against the Rockies."}

Henson, has been accused of sexual harassment by nine women of color, mostly who are African-American.\nHollywood manager Vincent Cirrincione has been accused of sexual harassment by nine women according to a new report. Full details: https:\/\/t.co\/YBziTbzw3G pic.twitter.com\/0ITseGXba5 \u2014 IndieWire (@IndieWire) February 3, 2018\nAccording to the Washington Post, the nine women\u2013eight of which are Black and one who is Asian-American\u2013came forward to the newspaper accusing Cirrincione of making sexual advances toward them. These accusations spanned almost 20 years from 1993-2011.\nThe Post reported that three of the women claimed that the Hollywood manager propositioned sex as a condition of representing them and their acting careers. Another woman claims Cirrincione offered to help her advance her career if she agreed to have sex with him on a monthly basis.\nIn addition, another actress swears that he masturbated in front of her in his office while she was a client of his.\nEven worse? Because Cirrincione is one of the few managers who supports Black actresses and works to catapult them into the spotlight, he would \u201cdangle\u201d his past and current success with Halle and Taraji in front of them like \u201cbait,\u201d the women said.\nOf course, Cirrincione denies that he sexually harassed or used his power and position to get these women to have sex with him. He claims that his only bad deeds were having consensual affairs with them and cheating on his girlfriend. \u201cWe live in a time where men are being confronted with a very real opportunity to take responsibility for their actions. I support this movement wholeheartedly. I have had female clients and employees my entire career in this industry. I have built a reputation for advancing the careers of women of color,\u201d Cirrincione said. He added, \u201cI have had affairs while in committed relationships, ones I am now ashamed to say are coming to light and shading my past and my reputation. I can say without a doubt that I have never used favors, sexual or otherwise, as a reason for managing anyone. I want to make it clear that not one of those relationships were anything but consensual.\u201d Halle Berry is speaking out after nine women accused her former manager of sexual harassment. https:\/\/t.co\/UO2CYSMzVx \u2014 JustJared.com (@JustJared) February 3, 2018\nOn Friday (Feb. 2), Halle took to social media to address the situation and remind the women that she stands by them no matter what.\n\u201dYesterday I was saddened by the allegations against my former manager, Vincent Cirrincione, but today I\u2019m sick after reading the horrifying detailed accounts of his abuse towards 9 women,\u201d the 50-year-old Oscar winner wrote.\n\u201cI\u2019m livid that he used me, and the role model he helped me become, to lure and manipulate innocent, vulnerable women of color for his predatory actions,\u201d she continued.\n\u201cI\u2019m deeply hurt and I want these women and countless others to know I see you. I hear you. You matter. I will fight for you.\u201d\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/halleberry\/status\/959615344854872065\nApparently, Berry ended her 25-year professional relationship with Cirrincione three years ago when she heard a disturbing story about him on a radio show.\n\u201cOver three years ago, a woman was on the radio saying that Halle Berry\u2019s manager was her worst casting couch experience ever. That news literally stopped me in my tracks. I immediately confronted Vince about it, and he denied it completely. But even with his denial, something didn\u2019t feel right in my spirit, and with the possibility that it could be true, I immediately ended our over-25-year relationship,\u201d Berry said in a statement.\nHowever, she is clear: Cirrincione had never been inappropriate with her.\nMeanwhile, Taraji, who is currently a client of Cirrincione , isn\u2019t talking about walking away from him, at least not yet.\nShe told the Post, \u201cI\u2019ve never had any issue with this on any level. He totally respected me\u2026He saw a single mother trying to make her dreams come true, and he nurtured that.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cHe wrote checks and wouldn\u2019t ask for anything in return. It wasn\u2019t coming from a creepy place. If anything, it empowered me. Like this man believes in me. I love him for that.\u201d\n\u201cHe is always brutally honest with me about black women\u2019s space in this industry\u2026 I just looked to him as a man who understood the black woman\u2019s plight in the industry. I never looked at him as a magical, mythical creature.\u201d\n***\nIt\u2019s not a secret that Black women in Hollywood face steeper obstacles than their white counterparts. As the Post pointed out, a UCLA study found that of the top 168 U.S. films ranked in 2015, Black women starred in just two films; white women starred in 44.\nTamika Lamison, a director and one of the nine women accusing Cirrincione of sexual harassment, stressed that these disparaging numbers make Black actresses even more vulnerable to this type of harassment.\n\u201cAny kind of sexual misconduct or harassment that\u2019s talked about from women is automatically suspect,\u201d said Lamison. \u201cFor black women, it seems like we are even more marginalized when it comes to something like that. Historically, how we have been treated and looked at \u2014 and to some degree oversexualized \u2014 makes it difficult.\u201d\nIn terms of Cirrincione, she stressed, \u201cYou have people who say he just made a pass, that he was just making an offer. But that\u2019s not just what happened.\u201d\n\u201cHe is abusing his power in a way that is really damaging.\u201d\nThis is a developing story and we will provide updates when they become available.\nRELATED NEWS:\nHim Too?

But that\u2019s O.K., because this particular story has a happy ending. Or at least, it will one day. I don\u2019t believe the Russia investigation will make its way to Trump. I doubt very much that Trump will be impeached for obstruction of justice, treason, or because his aides (and possibly even relatives) have ties to the Kremlin. But there\u2019s a pattern I\u2019ve started to see in his narcissism that is more likely to undercut him. And it won\u2019t simply befall him. It might even deal a considerable blow to the companies\u2014like Twitter and Facebook; the Daily Mail, InfoWars, and Fox News\u2014who have taken advantage of his attention-seeking for their own gain. And that, as the folks in Silicon Valley like to say, truly will make the world a better place.\nLately, however, I\u2019ve come to realize that while Trump probably won\u2019t go down in traditional forms of ignominy, he might face a worse fate. And that destiny is already beginning to take its course. Trump, it seems, is at the very beginning of becoming irrelevant. Sure, he's still the most-talked about person on Earth, but it is ebbing. There have even been moments when Trump\u2019s name wasn\u2019t on the front page of The New York Times. (Lord knows, to his consternation , he was not Time\u2019s person of the year.) And while there was a point in time when the most widely read , e-mailed, and shared stories at news outlets around the Web were almost all Trump-related, they are increasingly about other topics, like Potato Latke recipes and why your grumpy teenager doesn\u2019t want to talk to you . If you look right now on Twitter, he\u2019s curiously not among the global-trending topics. (Though he could be tomorrow.) Part of that is because Trump\u2019s eccentric behavior is becoming normalized. But it\u2019s also because we\u2019re learning to tune him out.\nIn this mortality tale, I feared, Trump might not ever be faced with the sort of chilling epiphany countenanced by men such as Roger Ailes and Joe Paterno, or Bernie Madoff and Bill Cosby, whose past demons returned to tread on them. We now live in a world where truth is increasingly obfuscated, or distorted by our filter bubbles and feedback loops. And this, more than any other, is the land that Trump presides over. According to this logic, the president seemed like he\u2019d be able to forever avoid accountability for allegedly assaulting women, making fun of people with disabilities, enticing violence around the globe, and leaving a stain on the most important office in the land. It seemed that karma may never actually come close to him.\nOne of the things that has bothered me the most about Donald Trump in the past two years, since he famously descended the escalator in Trump Tower\u2019s gilded lobby (with paid actors there to cheer for him), has been his ultimate ability to\u2014for lack of a more elegant phrase\u2014simply get away with it. And by it, I mean virtually everything. Trump has spent his life lying without repercussion about the number of floors in his buildings; the size of his crowds; whether he owns a real Renoir ; the veracity of the Billy Bush tape ; the contents of the tax bill; and the impact of climate change, among many other things. His explosive divorces have ended in remarriages; his numerous bankruptcies do not appear to have stymied his lifestyle; this, after all, is the guy who was elected president after losing the popular vote by nearly 3 million ballots.\nTrump\u2019s fear about becoming irrelevant has haunted him for decades. In October of last year, The New York Times got ahold of five hours of taped conversations between Trump and biographer Michael D\u2019Antonio. There are plenty of telling insights into his thinking during the protracted discussions, but few rival the moment when Trump seems to be completely vulnerable and honest about his biggest fear in life: becoming inconsequential. In the rare instance, Trump says that his favorite song is Peggy Lee\u2019s, \u201cIs That All There Is?\u201d because it mirrors his own unfulfilled feelings about the ephemeral nature of success. \u201cI\u2019ve had these tremendous successes and then I\u2019m off to the next one. Because, it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, is that all there is?\u2019\u201d Trump said candidly.\nSeizing on the moment, D\u2019Antonio asked Trump how that made him feel. Trump then explained that his need for attention has sustained him for decades, and that it \u201cwould unnerve\u201d him if he walked into a room and wasn\u2019t the center of it. I was reminded of that insight in a recent New York Times story detailing Trump\u2019s hour-by-hour self-care rituals inside the White House. In particular, I was stunned by one revealing paragraph. It wasn\u2019t about the dozen Diet Cokes that he consumes, or the amount of cable news that he crams into a workday, but rather Trump's inability to stomach the fact that there are things in the world to talk about besides himself. The advanced stages of his hyper myopia were jarring even given the low precedent that he has previously set. \u201cTo an extent that would stun outsiders, Mr. Trump, the most talked-about human on the planet, is still delighted when he sees his name in the headlines. And he is on a perpetual quest to see it there,\u201d the Times reported. And here\u2019s the clincher: \u201cOne former top adviser said Mr. Trump grew uncomfortable after two or three days of peace and could not handle watching the news without seeing himself on it.\u201d\nMost people who feel the way Trump feels about himself inevitably end up going to therapy, where they sit across from a professional and talk about how their parents didn\u2019t hug them enough as a child. Instead, Trump decided to become president and torture America. For now, he has been able to capitalize on that attention-seeking by going to Twitter (and sometimes Instagram and Facebook) to blurt out hyperbole and hatred in order to place himself squarely back in the white-hot center of everyone\u2019s attention. Newspapers scramble to cover the outrageous commentary; the nightly news runs endless coverage; and, for the completion of the news cycle, social media ensures that we all keep paying attention to the scandal until the next one hits. But something is nevertheless changing\u2014albeit only slightly. Trump isn\u2019t always the topic of the moment like he was a year, or even a few months, ago. His response to other tragedies that capture the news aren\u2019t always the thing we can\u2019t stop talking about. Sometimes we actually focus on the news, itself, as has been the case with the fires raging in Los Angeles; the reckoning of Harvey Weinstein and others; and the Republicans\u2019 architecture of an irresponsible, donor-class fellating tax bill.\nYou see this phenomenon, in part, in our culture\u2019s increasing backlash against social media. Chamath Palihapitiya, the former Facebook executive, noted this week that our reliance on these platforms was \u201cripping apart society.\u201d Sean Parker, who also ran Facebook, has publicly offered the same sentiment. Some former Twitter employees I know have said privately that they no longer use the service, and see it as a danger to democracy, and that Trump will be its downfall. It\u2019s easy to forget that many of these companies, which occupy so much mental space in our lives, didn\u2019t exist 20 years ago, and may be gone 20 years from now. Politics change just as quickly.\nSilicon Valley\u2019s role in facilitating Trump\u2019s rise to the White House is no longer up for debate. Putting aside the Russia meddling, the Twitter bots, and the fake news, these platforms were a game changer for Trump, and he was for them, too. Back in April 2016, I noted that this wasn\u2019t the first time Trump had run for office. He had been trying to get into the White House (or the New York State Executive Mansion) since Mark Zuckerberg was still in middle school. He tried to run for office in 1998, 2000, 2004, and 2012. Each time, his attempts were a failure. Then along came Twitter.\nThat platform, which itself was teetering at the time, has made Trump the most talked about human being on the planet, and the reward is that Twitter has become one of the most talke about companies on Earth. Trump is it's master, and can still wield Twitter to somehow shock and embarrass America in 140 280 characters. He still has an uncanny ability to generate headlines by picking the most infantile fights imaginable. And while his omnipresent name is still on the front page of daily newspapers around the world, there are increasingly more days that it is not. There are times you can turn on cable news, or the nightly talk shows, and see pundits and comedians talking about something other than you-know-who. And sure, those moments are fleeting and far-between. But they are happening now for the first time in the past two years, and they make us all feel better, and Trump worse.\nOne day, maybe three years from now, maybe (God forbid) seven, Trump will no longer be president. Someone else will enter that office, and the things they say will capture headlines, and they will be the person we\u2019ll talk about at the dinner table, or with our Uber driver. And Donald Trump will cease to be the center of the attention universe. He\u2019ll turn on the television and it won\u2019t be him they are talking about. It will be another president. He\u2019ll pick up the paper and there will be someone else\u2019s name in the headlines. Trump\u2019s brother was an alcoholic, his father a workaholic, and Trump is nothing more than a narcissist who is addicted to himself. When that drug is taken away from him, as it inevitably will be, it will destroy him. And nothing gives me a larger sense of relief than knowing at the end of his life, he\u2019ll be irrelevant, and that he\u2019ll know that, too."}

Mr. Matier added the firm is capable of producing about one of the rockets every 29 days.\nStory continues below advertisement\nStory continues below advertisement\nMr. Degtiarov said each launch would take up to two minutes and from three kilometres away would sound no louder than a commercial aircraft.\nIt's estimated the rocket will move over 20,000 metres through the sky within 105 seconds, with the public able to view the spectacle from vantage points at Little Dover, N.S., about eight kilometres south of Canso, Mr. Matier says.\nYuzhnoye State Design Office is the rocket-design company that works under the State Space Agency of Ukraine, but operates commercially. A second firm, Yuzhmash, is a manufacturing company and operates the same way and builds what Yuzhnoye designs.\nOver all, the project is a private-sector venture, but will require the province's environmental approvals and further regulatory approvals for launching procedures.\nMr. Matier said his firm will want satellite launch customers to begin putting forward down payments by the beginning of next year for the preparation of their rockets and the launching costs.\n\"There's an 18-month schedule ahead of the launch date where they need to start making some of these down payments and that will accrue in an escrow [account] as we're moving forward,\" he explained.\nStory continues below advertisement\n\"Financing continues. It's that kind of project. You're always building your financial structure,\" he said."}

Two straight earnings reports have led to significant selloffs of both UA stock and UAA stock. The move to a triple-class system in April, and new ticker symbols announced in November, haven\u2019t helped.\nSource: Shutterstock\nBut the key problem remains a business that has disappointed the market so far over the past few quarters.\nThat said, the disappointment has come in part from expectations for Under Armour stock that were too high, rather than performance that was objectively poor. UA still grew revenue 22% in its fiscal 2016. Non-GAAP earnings per share rose nearly 10%, adjusting for the stock dividend earlier in the year.\nEven in a fourth quarter whose results sent UAA stock down more than 20%, sales increased 12%, with international revenues up 55%.\nAs poorly as the stock has performed of late, though, this isn\u2019t a broken company, nor is it an unprofitable one. That has led to speculation that Under Armour might become a takeover target.\nThat makes sense at some point \u2026 but not yet.\nWhy An Under Armour Takeover Is Unlikely Soon\n\u201cYou know, I think a lot of people bet against Tom Brady the other night, too.\u201d\nThat\u2019s what Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank told CNBC soon after the company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings report. A reference to the Patriots\u2019 historic comeback hardly sounds like a metaphor for a founder looking for the exits. Instead, it sounds as if Plank is intent on Under Armour making a similar comeback itself.\nAnd the catch with Under Armour is that a decision to sell is Plank\u2019s and Plank\u2019s alone. His class B shares entitle him to 10 votes per share, meaning he has roughly 65% of voting power, according to the website. That voting power also makes the valuation gap between Class A shares (UA) and Class C shares (UAA) quite odd. Class A shares get one vote per share; Class C shares get none. But Class A shareholders as a group remain a minority, subject to Plank\u2019s desires.)\nThere\u2019s little reason to imagine Plank will sell Under Armour now, with shares down nearly two-thirds from all-time highs. The former college football player is intensely competitive, and like many founders, devout in his belief in himself and his company. He\u2019s also just 44 years old \u2014 far from the age where he might be ready to cash in his chips and move on.\nThat said, there is a scenario where Under Armour may decide that selling out to or merger with a larger company makes some sense.\nThe brick-and-mortar retail landscape continues to change amid online competition. Under Armour customers ranging from Macy\u2019s Inc (NYSE: M ) to Finish Line Inc (NASDAQ: FINL ) are closing stores aggressively. Both scale and e-commerce are more important than ever; and in both areas, Under Armour lags its ultimate rival, Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE ).\nShould Plank change his mind, there no doubt will be suitors for Under Armour.\nWho Might Take Out UAA Stock?\nShould Plank change his mind, there no doubt would be a number of interested companies. PVH Corp (NYSE: PVH ) and VF Corp (NYSE: VFC ) both own male-oriented brands. PVH has Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger; VF owns North Face, Timberland, Lee and Wrangler, among many other brands. Under Armour would seem to tuck in nicely to both companies\u2019 portfolios.\nNext Page"}

While many in the market are betting on Kuroda\u2019s reappointment, some see the chance of other candidates such as Etsuro Honda, Abe\u2019s former aide who has expressed interest in the post, landing the job.\nKoichi Hamada, a Yale University academic and Abe\u2019s economic adviser, praised Kuroda but said there were other well-qualified individuals who could take up the reins.\n\u201cThe standard strategy is to continue with Governor Kuroda, or any person who pursues \u2018Abenomics\u2019 like him,\u201d he told Reuters.\nKuroda and his two deputy governors - career central banker Hiroshi Nakaso and former academic Kikuo Iwata - will see their terms end on April 8 and March 19, respectively.\nNominees for such high-profile positions need approval by both houses of parliament to become effective. The government usually submits its nominees for various posts in two rounds.\nThe BOJ nominees are likely to be in the second round and won\u2019t be submitted to parliament until the first round gets approved, which may take until mid-February, the sources say.\nThat means the government\u2019s nominees for BOJ governor and deputy governors won\u2019t be presented to parliament until later this month or even early March, they say.\n\u201cIt might not come until late February,\u201d said a ruling party lawmaker familiar with the process, a view echoed by two other sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.\nThe timing will depend much on how smoothly the government can push through parliament the state budget for next fiscal year and find time to take the nominees\u2019 list for vote.\nIt is a near certainty the government\u2019s nominations will get the majority needed to pass parliament, as Abe\u2019s ruling coalition has enough seats in both houses of Diet.\nONE DEPUTY POST FOR A CENTRAL BANKER?\nThe choice of the new BOJ leadership will be crucial as it would set the path of monetary policy and affect how quickly the central bank could follow in the footsteps of its U.S. and European peers in dialing back crisis-era stimulus steps.\nWhile Kuroda has dismissed the chance of an early exit from easy policy, analysts see his reappointment as heightening the chance for a slow but steady shift toward monetary normalisation.\nThe choice of candidates with more radical views like Honda, an advocate of big fiscal spending financed by faster central bank money printing, may jolt markets as investors may see it as a break away from the current policy framework, analysts say.\nThe government will likely fill one of the two deputy posts with a career central banker with deep expertise on markets and technicalities of monetary policy, the sources say.\nA reappointment of Nakaso or an appointment of BOJ Executive Director Masayoshi Amamiya, who masterminded many of the bank\u2019s monetary policy steps, are seen as possibilities, they say.\nA Reuters poll last year showed many analysts expect Kuroda to serve another five-year term as governor, though some saw the top job going to Honda, Nakaso or Amamiya."}

Marie Piccone, Manbulloo Limited\n\u201cWe\u2019re watching what\u2019s happening each day, but we have not noticed any signs of other Australian businesses, or our Korean partners, feeling in danger in recent months.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never felt unsafe over there and we certainly wouldn\u2019t consider dropping any of our business to Korea.\u201d\nStaying calm and carrying on\nIn Seoul, Australian trade and investment specialist, Daniel Kim, said the build up in ferocious threats and long-range missile tests from Kim Jong-un\u2019s maverick in North Korean communist regime during the past nine months had created \u201cvery little\u201d visible impact on people in neighbouring South Korea.\nNor did all the hoo-ha appear to have hurt the country\u2019s attraction as a market for new Australian business interest.\nMr Kim, the trade commissioner with Trade and Investment Queensland, said the facts spoke for themselves.\n\u201cThe travel warnings from Canberra have not changed for Australians visiting here \u2013 \u2018exercise normal safety precautions\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYes, we\u2019ve had some Australian CEO\u2019s asking questions with regard to North Korea, but only two of the 40 business visits from Australia I\u2019ve been associated with (this year) have been postponed.\n\u201cMost exporters realise South Koreans just get on with their lives \u2013 they\u2019ve been living with this situation in the north since the 1950s.\u201d\nHe said fortuitously for Australia, \u201cenormous demand\u201d was emerging for overseas food and beverage imports as modern Korea\u2019s overall self sufficiency in agricultural production declined.\nSeoul-based trade commissioner with Trade and Investment Queensland, Daniel Kim, says South Koreans, and their Australian business partners, are \"just get on with their lives\".\n\u201cThat\u2019s translating into deals for many countries \u2013 Korean food imports increased to be worth $16b last year,\u201d Mr Kim said.\nExports from Queensland alone jumped about 30 per cent.\nOne notable new player was Bundaberg Brewed Drinks which sold 1 million bottles of ginger beer within six months of landing its first container shipment.\nMr Kim said opportunities for Australian processed poultry were now on the cards in the wake of Australian egg producers getting a foot in the door with fresh and processed egg products this year after bird flu forced about 30 million birds (almost a third of the Korean flock) to be culled in the past year.\nOur good reputation counts\nSouth Korea\u2019s high priority on food security and safe products had already fostered close relationships and subsidiary businesses within Australia, including beef processing contracts and value-added exports which originated during the Mad Cow disease scare overseas in the 1990s.\nNutriceuticals had become a new active area for Korean investment in Australia.\n\u201cKorean investors like Australia\u2019s credentials, but they\u2019re not interested in a land grab,\u201d Mr Kim said.\n\u201cThe focus is on strategies to deliver safe, premium quality products and innovative food technology to sell in their home markets and globally.\u201d\n\u201cThere are also shared values in relationships with Korean businesses which tend to create a level of intimacy that\u2019s much more solid than just the transactional function of buying and selling goods.\u201d\nManbulloo managing director, Marie Piccone, with her Australian produce in Seoul.\nMrs Piccone, whose Manbulloo operation grows about 800 hectares of mangoes, mostly for domestic markets, agreed the Korean market was less hyped up and more meaningful than other fast rising Asian export destinations.\n\u201cProvided you stick to your commitment to deliver what you promise it takes a lot for Korean partners to want to break that relationship,\u201d she said.\n\u201cKoreans don\u2019t get highly strung or agitated about what\u2019s going on in the news \u2013 they may be a bit more concerned at times, but they live with this sort of noise from the North every day.\u201d"}

The officers arrived at the home to arrest the man's father, though court documents did not make clear the reason the father was taken into custody.\nRamirez, now in custody in Tacoma, Washington, was granted temporary permission to live and work legally in the United States under a programme called the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, established in 2012 by Democratic President Obama, according to a court filing.\nThe programme protects from deportation 750,000 people who were brought to the United States illegally as children, sometimes called the \"dreamers,\" and gives them the temporary right to work legally in the United States.\nTrump, a Republican who took office on Jan. 20, has promised a crackdown on the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States, most of whom come from Mexico and other Latin American countries. A move against DACA recipients like Ramirez would represent a significant broadening of immigration enforcement under Trump.\nRamirez filed a challenge to his detention in Seattle federal court on Monday, arguing that the government violated his constitutional rights because he had work authorization under the DACA programme.\nEthan Dettmer, a partner in the law firm Gibson Dunn & Crutcher who is one of the lawyers representing Ramirez, said he is not aware of any other DACA recipient who has been arrested.\n\"We are hoping this detention was a mistake,\" Dettmer said.\nA BROKEN PROMISE?\nAnother one of his lawyers, Mark Rosenbaum of the legal advocacy group Public Counsel, characterized the DACA programme as a promise from the federal government's executive branch that DACA recipients would not be targeted for deportation.\n\"We have no reason to believe that promise will be broken. This case should not see the inside of a courtroom,\" Rosenbaum said.\nRamirez was in custody and unavailable for comment. Representatives for Immigration and Customs Enforcement declined immediate comment on the lawsuit.\nEmily Langley, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in Seattle, said the Justice Department is still reviewing the case.\nU.S. immigration officers last week arrested more than 680 people in the country illegally. Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said the operations, conducted in at least a dozen states, were routine and consistent with regular operations. But immigrant advocacy groups and Democrats have expressed concern that the Trump administration will escalate immigration enforcement efforts in line with the president's tough stance towards illegal immigrants.\nTrump campaigned on a promise to roll back Obama's executive actions on immigration, but since assuming office he has kept his public comments on DACA vague.\nIn an interview with ABC News last month, Trump said his administration was devising a policy on how to deal with people covered by DACA. \"They are here illegally. They shouldn't be very worried. I do have a big heart. We're going to take care of everybody. We're going to have a very strong border,\" Trump said at the time.\nUnder DACA, the government collected information including participants' addresses that potentially could be used to locate and deport them if the programme is reversed.\nRamirez was brought to the United States from Mexico in about 2001 at about age 7, according to the lawsuit. The government granted him a DACA card in 2014 and renewed it in 2016, finding that he was no threat to public safety. He has a 3-year-old son, according to the complaint.\nRamirez in his lawsuit is seeking his immediate release and an injunction forbidding the government from arresting him again. A hearing in the case has been scheduled for Friday.\nAccording to the lawsuit, Ramirez was asleep at his father's home last Friday morning when ICE agents arrived and arrested the father. When they entered, they asked Ramirez if he was in the country legally, and Ramirez said he had a work permit, the lawsuit stated.\nICE agents took Ramirez to a processing centre in Seattle and he again disclosed his DACA work permit, the lawsuit stated.\n\"It doesn't matter, because you weren't born in this country,\" one of the agents said, according to the lawsuit.\nRamirez was fingerprinted, booked and taken to a detention centre in Tacoma where he was still in custody on Tuesday, Rosenbaum said.\n(Additional reporting by Bill Rigby in Seattle; Editing by Sue Horton and Will Dunham)"}

The Attorney General\u2019s lawsuit against Fitchett is frivolous and has no basis in law or fact. The judge\u2019s questioning of Assistant Attorney General Sandra Pullman at the hearing in Schneiderman v. Griepp, focused on the Attorney General\u2019s shifting definition of \u201charassment.\u201d The State\u2019s interpretation seemed to focus on the reaction of a listener to another\u2019s speech, something that lined up with neither New York City\u2019s harassment ordinance or the First Amendment. Pullman quoted the Webster\u2019s definition of harassment as including speech that \u201cannoys\u201d someone, which is not constitutionally or logically actionable.\nJudge Amon took issue with the State\u2019s targeting of what Pullman labeled as \u201cannoying behavior,\u201d saying that was vague, and challenging the state with a series of hypotheticals. The judge asked, \u201cIf a person followed a patient down the sidewalk, politely repeating, \u2018You should consider keeping your baby,\u2019\u201d Amon asked, \u201cwould that be harassment? What if the protester stayed three feet away from the patient? What if someone followed you down the street, repeatedly telling you they liked your haircut? Would that be harassment?\u201d\n\u201cIt is inexcusable for the highest legal officer of the State of New York to declare war on free speech, and especially to openly target religious and pro-life viewpoints,\u201d Liberty Counsel\u2019s Assistant Vice President of Legal Affairs Roger Gannam demonstrated to the court the absurdity of Pullman\u2019s argument that the listener\u2019s reaction dictates whether a person\u2019s speech is illegal. \u201cIf harassment is established only by its effect on the listeners,\u201d Gannam said, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t know you committed harassment until after the fact.\u201d\nAttorney General Schneiderman\u2019s lawsuit is based on the federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE) and similar New York laws. Enacted by Congress to prevent actual violence and physical obstruction of abortion facility entrances, Schneiderman is using FACE to shut down peaceful speech on a public sidewalk. In his press conference last year announcing the lawsuit, he said, \u201cWe are not a nation where you can choose your point of view,\u201d and that pro-life Christians \u201crun their mouths\u201d with \u201cunlawful, un-American rhetoric.\u201d He called Christians\u2019 efforts to counsel women considering abortion and to advocate for the rights of the unborn \u201chorrifying\u201d and \u201cillegal.\u201d\n\u201cIt is inexcusable for the highest legal officer of the State of New York to declare war on free speech, and especially to openly target religious and pro-life viewpoints,\u201d said Mat Staver, Founder and Chairman of Liberty Counsel. \u201cIt is shocking that the Attorney General would say publicly that \u2018we are not a nation where you can choose your point of view.\u2019 The essence of freedom is precisely that we can choose our point of view,\u201d said Staver.\nLiberty Counsel is an international nonprofit, litigation, education, and policy organization dedicated to advancing religious freedom, the sanctity of life, and the family since 1989, by providing pro bono assistance and representation on these and related topics.\nPlease adhere to our commenting policy to avoid being banned.

He had not yet gone through security.\nKim, who died on the way to a hospital, told medical workers before he died that he had been attacked with a chemical spray, the official said.\nSouth Korea\u2019s spy service said Wednesday that North Korea had been trying for five years to kill Kim Jong Nam. But the National Intelligence Service did not definitely say that it was North Korea, just that it was presumed to be a North Korean operation, according to lawmakers who briefed reporters about the closed door meeting with the spy officials.\nThe NIS cited Kim Jong Un\u2019s alleged \u201cparanoia\u201d about his half-brother. Still, the NIS has a history of botching intelligence on the North and has long sought to portray the North\u2019s leaders as mentally unstable.\nIn Malaysia, police were searching for clues in the CCTV footage from the airport, said Selangor police chief Abdul Samah Mat. The airport is in Selangor near Kuala Lumpur.\nKim Jong Nam was estranged from his younger brother, the North Korean leader. Although he had been tipped by some outsiders as a possible successor to his dictator father, others thought that was unlikely because he lived outside the country, including recently in Macau, Singapore and Malaysia.\nHe reportedly fell further out of favor when he was caught trying to enter Japan on a false passport in 2001, saying he wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland.\nMultiple South Korean media reports, citing unidentified sources, said Kim Jong Nam was killed at the airport by two women believed to be North Korean agents. They fled in a taxi and were being sought by Malaysian police, the reports said.\nA Malaysian police statement confirmed the death of a 46-year-old North Korean man whom it identified from his travel document as Kim Chol, born in Pyongyang on June 10, 1970. \u201cInvestigation is in progress and a post mortem examination request has been made to ascertain the cause of death,\u201d the statement said.\nKen Gause, at the CNA think tank in Washington who has studied North Korea\u2019s leadership for 30 years, said Kim Chol was a name that Kim Jong Nam has traveled under. He is believed to have been born May 10, 1971, although birthdays are always unclear for senior North Koreans, Gause said.\nMark Tokola, vice president of the Korea Economic Institute in Washington and a former deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul, said it would be surprising if Kim Jong Nam was not killed on the orders of his brother, given that North Korean agents have reportedly tried to assassinate Kim Jong Nam in the past.\n\u201cIt seems probable that the motivation for the murder was a continuing sense of paranoia on the part of Kim Jong Un,\u201d Tokola wrote in a commentary Tuesday. Although there was scant evidence that Kim Jong Nam was plotting against the North Korean leader, he provided an alternative for North Koreans who would want to depose his brother.\nThe reported killing came as North Korea celebrated its latest missile launch, which foreign experts were analyzing for evidence of advancement in the country\u2019s missile capabilities. For the next several days, North Korea will be marking the birthday of its late leader Kim Jong Il, the brothers\u2019 father, though they have different mothers. The major holiday this Thursday is called the \u201cDay of the Shining Star\u201d and will be feted with figure skating and synchronized swimming exhibitions, fireworks and mass rallies.\nSince taking power in late 2011, Kim Jong Un has executed or purged a slew of high-level government officials in what the South Korean government has described as a \u201creign of terror.\u201d The most spectacular was the 2013 execution by anti-aircraft fire of his uncle, Jang Song Thaek, once considered the country\u2019s second-most-powerful man, for what the North alleged was treason.\nGause said Kim Jong Nam had been forthright that he did not have political ambitions, although he was publicly critical of the North Korean regime and his brother\u2019s legitimacy in the past.\nKim Jong Nam had been less outspoken since 2011, when North Korean assassins reportedly tried to shoot him in Macau, Gause said, though the details of the attempted killing are murky. South Korea also reportedly jailed a North Korean spy in 2012 who admitted to trying to organize a hit-and-run accident targeting Kim Jong Nam in China in 2010.\nDespite the attempts on his life, Kim Jong Nam had reportedly traveled to North Korea since then, so it was assumed he was no longer under threat. Kim Jong Nam may have become more vulnerable as his defender in the North Korean hierarchy, Kim Kyong Hui \u2014 Kim Jong Un\u2019s aunt and the wife of his executed uncle, Jang Song Thaek \u2014 appears to have fallen from favor or died. She has not been seen in public for more than three years, Gause said.\nKim Jong Il had at least three sons with two women, as well as a daughter by a third. Kim Jong Nam was the eldest, followed by Kim Jong Chul, who is a few years older than Kim Jong Un and is known as a playboy who reportedly attended Eric Clapton concerts in London in 2015. It\u2019s unclear what positon he has in the North Korean government. A younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, was named a member of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea\u2019s Central Committee during a North Korean party congress last May. She has a position in a propaganda and agitation department and is known as Kim Jong Un\u2019s gatekeeper, Gause said.\nWhile the most likely explanation for the killing was that Kim Jong Un was removing a potential challenger to North Korean leadership within his own family, he could also be sending a warning to North Korean officials to demonstrate the reach of the regime. It follows the defection last year of a senior diplomat from the North Korean Embassy in London who has spoken of his despair at Kim\u2019s purges.\nAP Reporter: Eileen NG\nAssociated Press writers Hyung-jin Kim in Seoul, South Korea, and Matthew Pennington in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report."}

And it means specially designed smart babies are not in anyone\u2019s near future.\nBrain activity SCIEPRO \/ Getty Images\nThe study pointed to 52 genes that influence intelligence, some of them previously identified. Yet they account for less than 5 percent of the variation in human intelligence, the research team reports in the journal Nature Genetics.\nMany of the genes have other known roles as well, although most are involved in brain development, the international team of researchers found.\n\u201cThese findings provide new insight into the genetic architecture of intelligence,\u201d the team, led by Danielle Posthuma of VU University Amsterdam, wrote in their report.\nRelated: DNA Scan Finds 18 New Autism Genes\nThey studied databases covering more than 78,000 adults and children \u2014 all of them of European descent. These included Britain\u2019s BioBank, which is sampling and analyzing the entire genomes of an assortment of volunteers, as well as a database of exceptionally intelligent people and some studies of twins.\nThey used two different kinds of genome-wide analysis to pinpoint genes associated with intelligence, looking at all the genes in the human DNA map.\nRelated: This Gene Might Affect How Much You Drink\nOverall, they identified 52 genes, including 40 that had not been linked with intelligence before.\n\u201cWe show that the identified genes are predominantly expressed in brain tissue, and pathway analysis indicates the involvement of genes regulating cell development,\u201d they wrote.\nAnd although 52 genes sounds like a lot, they only explain a small part of the differences in intelligence between one person and another.\n\u201cOur calculations show that the current results explain up to 4.8 percent of the variance in intelligence,\u201d they wrote.\nRelated: Gene Editing OK for Health, Panel Says\nGenes accounted for about 70 percent of the variation in education levels among the people studied, the team found.\nOther studies have shown that up to half a person\u2019s intelligence is inherited, which leaves half to other factors.\nSome of the genes are interesting. One, called SHANK3, is involved in the formation of synapses \u2014 the connections between brain cells. \u201cMutations in this gene are a cause of autism spectrum disorder, which is characterized by impairments in social interaction and communication, and restricted behavioral patterns and interests.

It may take many years to tease out all the various forms of these genes and how they affect intelligence, other traits, and disease.\nScientists know that only very rarely is there a single gene for any human trait. Mutations in a single gene cause cystic fibrosis, for instance, and a few other rare diseases. Usually, traits such as eye color, skin color and height are affected by a number of genes and by other stretches of DNA."}

In the context of geo-strategic situation in the region, CPEC offers an alternative solution to link up Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, which directly border China, as well as Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, to the route, thus ruling out reliance on the traditional perception that all roads from Pakistan into the Central Asia go through Kabul or Wakhan strip.\nPresident Mamnoon Hussain is convinced that the China Pakistan Economic Corridor project would enhance contacts of Central Asian States with many countries of the world while through this project the shortest sea route would be available from the Gwadar Port to Kyrgyzstan. The Minister for Planning and Development, Ahsan Iqbal, reiterates that Pakistan and Central Asian Republics would benefit from the platform and infrastructure being constructed under China Pakistan Economic Corridor.\nAddressing a seminar titled \u201cPakistan \u2013 A Land of Opportunities for Central Asian Republics\u201d, the minister stated two more corridors would also be completed during the next few years based on CPEC connecting Pakistan, China and Central Asia. One corridor would link Peshawar with Kabul and Tajikistan and the other will connect Quetta with Herat and Turkmenistan. He believes that these corridors would not only provide connectivity to Central Asia but also extend it to the Russian Federation.\nAlmost all the CARs have shown interest in joining the CPEC. With abundance of natural resources such as oil, gas, gold, and other metals, CARs have great potentials to invest in CPEC-related projects and its industrial zones. Experts hope the recent improvement in bilateral relations with Russia would help and improve the prospects of wider regional connectivity through multilateral tracks.\nAs it is, all the five Central Asian States are landlocked and don\u2019t have access to sea. Thus, they can launch trade and build energy corridor through the CPEC project. The dream of transit trade can be materialised through the Gwadar Port. Tajikistan could access the Indian Ocean by connecting the China-Pakistan railway once it is completed.\nOn the other hand, India calls Central Asia by referring to it as \u201cour near abroad\u201d and \u2018extended neighbourhood\u2019. But it thinks itself as a challenger to China in Central Asia while developing bilateral relations with the five new republics \u2014 Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.\nNew Delhi, through various efforts, is trying to consolidate its geopolitical and geo-economic presence in the region. But there has not been considerable progress on the Chabahar project, considered an important facilitator of trade to and from Central Asia through the war-torn Afghanistan. As it is, the Chahbahar Port is unlikely to be a potential game-changer for India. Given the hurdles, the new port facility would not offer the country an alternative transit route to landlocked Afghanistan and other parts of Central Asia and a counter to Chinese moves in its backyard.\nIndia is at a disadvantage because China shares long borders and deep relations with the CARs; India does not. The Chinese continue to build deep military, economic, and defence cooperation with CARs and at a large scale while India lags behind. According to Indian economists, economic relations with CARs remain at low level while mutual investment is also negligible. Roy Chaudhry admits in India\u2019s Economic Times: \u201cChina has made significant headway in the region, with $10 billion in grants and aid to SCO members in Central Asia and developing regional linkages between Central Asia and its western regions. Central Asia is central to China\u2019s OBOR policy. India\u2019s lack of direct overland access to the region due to Pakistan\u2019s reluctance in allowing Indian goods to pass through its territory has hurt New Delhi\u2019s trade interests in the region.\u201d\nLooking at vast transit-trade and investment opportunities and potentials, CARs, synthesizing all available sources, should take the major benefits that CPEC offers. Objectively evaluating, it seems CPEC would be the critical variable in CARs' future trade and economic linkages."}

In any presidential transition, there will be tensions between career civil servants and political appointees pushing a new president\u2019s agenda, but according to experts on the matter, this administration\u2019s use of the term may exacerbate those relations.\nThe term was offhandedly used in 2000 by George W. Bush\u2019s incoming press secretary, Ari Fleischer. It was central to the language of Romney\u2019s 2012 transition plan, which was provided to the Trump team. But its use here seems systematic, making many within various federal agencies feel they are being conquered.\n\u201cThe language of war being used suggests that cooperation is not the primary philosophy dictating this transition period,\u201d says Professor Heath Brown, who studies presidential transitions at CUNY\u2019s John Jay College of Criminal Justice. \u201cIf the operating philosophy is one of combat rather than cooperation, then we\u2019re in for some trouble with how these agencies are going to function on a day-to-day basis.\u201d\nBecause the Trump team threw out New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s transition plans and \u201cstarted from scratch on election day,\u201d Brown says, there is \u201ca larger level of chaos in the past for an already chaotic process.\u201d\nGiven the fact that Trump was a reality TV star, it is not surprising that communications is the main focus of these beachhead teams.\n\u201c[Trump\u2019s people] want to control message in a lot of different ways, and for that reason I think they have made that a priority,\u201d Brown says. \u201cThe Trump transition team devoted a lot more staff resources to communications than transition teams in the past \u2026 In the past, communications just hasn\u2019t been a first priority.\u201d\nIn 2009, Obama only had two communications people on his 13-member senior transition staff. In contrast, at least 10 of 23 staffers in Trump\u2019s transition team served some communications function, Brown says.\nIn the process, they may well be changing what \u201ccommunications\u201d means\u2014from informing the public, or even spinning the message, to something more like outright propaganda. Democracy in Crisis uncovered a 1996 Cornell Daily Sun article about then-CNN analyst Kellyanne Conway that shows she has been thinking about media and manipulation for at least 20 years. The story paraphrases Conway (n\u00e9e Fitzpatrick) speaking to student groups about \u201cmanipulative media and political jargon.\u201d In the talk, she also criticized people for \u201cfollowing what is decided by a few elite.\u201d\nA section of article subtitled \u201cQuestions of Reality\u201d notes: \u201cIn a generation where television and Internet images \u2018bombard our senses,\u2019 it is essential, according to Fitzpatrick, to realize that the soundbytes or visuals prepared by the evening news editors do not represent reality.\u201d\nConway, the article reads, \u201capplauded [Bill Clinton\u2019s] ability to use the media to his advantage.\u201d\nSpicer Lied in First Press Conference\nWhile this shows that Conway\u2019s obsession with controlling the media narrative is not new, it also underlines how she and her boss are pushing the standard spin of \u201990s-era Washington into the full-blown denial of reality in the age of Trump.\nDuring the Trump campaign, Politifact found that only 4% of his claims could be considered entirely truthful. Some, including President Obama, na\u00efvely thought the power of the presidency would curb, rather than increase, Trump\u2019s tendency to lie. But thus far truths remain merely occasional, almost accidental.\nAfter the inauguration on Jan. 20, in the first \u201cunofficial\u201d press conference of the new administration, press secretary Sean Spicer stood in front of reporters and repeatedly lied to the press about things that didn\u2019t matter. It was pointless from any standard political means-ends perspective. ( Baltimore City Paper did a great job putting together the actual numbers.)\nLater, in his first \u201cofficial\u201d press conference, Spicer said \u201csometimes we can disagree with the facts.\u201d\nBetween Spicer\u2019s two statements, on the Sunday talk shows, Conway baptized Trump-speak with a succinct name: \u201calternative facts.\u201d She also threatened to \u201crethink our relationship\u201d with NBC if \u201cMeet the Press\u201d host Chuck Todd persisted in saying Spicer had lied.\nA couple days later, Trump advisor and Lenin wannabe Stephen Bannon called the press the \u201copposition party,\u201d which, he said, should \u201ckeep its mouth shut.\u201d Almost immediately after this, Trump gave Bannon a spot on the National Security Council.\nThe attacks on the press, however, are only part of a larger attack on facts themselves\u2014attacks beginning, appropriately, with the communications-obsessed beachheads now inside federal agencies.\nTrump ordered the EPA to freeze all of its grants, to take down the climate change section of its website (although the administration later backed down on plans to remove content) and to cease all communications with the press.\nThen, according to an email obtained by BuzzFeed News, the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s research division prohibited employees, including scientists, from communicating or sharing information with the public. The USDA later lifted the gag order, saying that it was released \u201cwithout Departmental direction\u201d and was not sent at the request of the Trump administration.\nBut information about climate change is not the only thing at risk\u2014data, science and research are being suppressed. And Trump\u2019s congressional allies are all too happy to play along.\nRepublican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and Arizona Congressman Paul Gosar introduced bills this week that say \u201cno federal funds may be used to design, build, maintain, utilize or provide access to a federal database of geospatial information on community racial disparities or disparities in access to affordable housing.\u201d\nThis racist bill, which would help maintain the kind of segregation affecting cities like Milwaukee, Baltimore and St. Louis, could still die in committee, but it is of a piece with Trump\u2019s all-out war on facts. Deprived of access to facts, citizens are incapable of making decisions. This is an essential feature of tyranny.\nAs an air of war prevails in Washington, using the term beachhead may in fact be among the small minority of things the Trump team is honest about."}

Back in March 2015, Harrison Ford made headlines when he somehow managed to survive a plane crash, after making an emergency landing on a Los Angeles golf course. Today we have word that the actor almost had another close call in Southern California, this time narrowly missing a 737 airliner in an incident that could have been much more serious.\nNBC News first reported on this incident, which took place at the John Wayne Airport in Orange County. The actor was instructed to land his single-engine Husky aircraft on runway 20-L, but instead, he mistook a taxiway for that runway, as his plane flew over an American Airlines 737 airliner. The actor was recorded on air traffic control recordings after the incident, stating this.\n\"Was that airliner meant to be underneath me?\"\nAir traffic controllers then told the actor that he had landed on a taxiway, and not the runway he was instructed to land on. Landing on a taxiway is a violation of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations. The air traffic controllers told NBC News that they gave the celebrated actor the proper landing instructions, and that he repeated them back. The 737 airliner, American Airlines flight 1546 to Dallas, Texas, with 110 passengers and six crew members, departed safely just a few minutes after the incident.\nThis incident has prompted an FAA investigation, which could result in punishment ranging from a simple warning letter, to a suspension of his pilot's license. It remains to be seen how long the investigation will take, and if there will be any consequences handed down from this incident. The 74-year-old actor reportedly trained to become a pilot in the 1950s, and while he is a respected and talented pilot, he has had a few other brushes with death in the skies, even before the 2015 golf course crash.\nIn 1999, Harrison Ford crash-landed a helicopter in Ventura County, California, during a training flight with an instructor, and then in 2000, he was forced to make an emergency landing at the Lincoln Municipal Airport in Nebraska. While neither he nor his passenger was hurt in that 2000 emergency landing, the plane's wing tips clipped the runway, causing damage to the plane. He has also used his piloting skills during two search and rescue missions near his temporary home in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. In 2000, he rescued a dehydrated hiker he found at Table Mountain in Teton County, Wyoming, and flew her to the hospital, and in just a year later in 2001, the iconic actor spotted a 13-year-old Boy Scout who was lost outside Yellowstone National Park, while flying his helicopter. Hopefully we'll have more on this latest aerial incident with Harrison Ford soon."}

Last month it announced the sale of its US gas and power business and began the sale of its oil liquids unit.\n\"We see an increased risk that Noble may not be able to meet its debt obligations in the next six months, especially if the company is not able to turnaround or if it breaches its financial covenants and fails to get a waiver from banks,\" S&P said.\nLast week, Noble reported a second-quarter loss of US$1.75 billion (S$2.37 billion), weeks after warning it faced its steepest quarterly loss in a year and a half and would slash jobs and sell assets to cut debt.\nS&P said it had cut Noble's long-term corporate credit rating to CCC- from CCC+ meaning it heightened default risks from substantial to imminent.\nMoody's also cut Noble's corporate family rating and senior unsecured bond ratings to Caa3 from Caa1, reflecting a similar reading of risks surrounding the trading house.\n\"The downgrade reflects significant default risk for Noble within the next several quarters, given its operating cash burn, declining cash levels and large debt maturities.

Colorado, Washington and Oregon were the first states to do so, and they've already developed a regulated, taxable industry for recreational marijuana, with dispensaries and growers. The other five states voted to legalize recreational marijuana on the day Trump was elected, but haven't had time to develop a regulatory structure.\nSessions hasn't said anything specific about what he's going to do about marijuana, or if he's going to do anything at all. But it's still illegal under federal law, and Sessions has made it clear that he's against legalization.\n\"I reject the idea that American will be a better place if marijuana is sold in every corner store,\" he said, in a speech in Richmond, Va., last month. \"And I am astonished to hear people suggest that we can solve our heroin crisis by legalizing marijuana -- so people can trade one life-wrecking dependency for another that's only slightly less awful.\"\nThe Attorney General recently appointed a task force to review \"existing policies\" for marijuana and to \"ensure consistency\" with the anti-drug policy of the Trump administration.\nRelated: Trump is a buzz kill for pot stocks\nSeparately, White House press secretary Sean Spicer has said to expect \"greater enforcement\" of federal marijuana laws.\nSteve Rusnack, owner of the Full Bloom Cannabis dispensary in Fork Kent, Maine, sells medical marijuana and would like to expand into recreational now that it's been legalized by the state. But he's concerned about the possibility of a federal crackdown.\n\"If I start seeing DEA agents locking down recreational businesses out West, I'm going to stick with medical,\" said Rusnack. \"I've got a family. I don't want to get locked up.\"\nMaine is one of five states, along with California, Nevada, Alaska and Massachusetts, that voted to legalize recreational marijuana last year. State lawmakers still have to work out regulations, and local jurisdictions also have to set tax rates and make zoning decisions as to where the dispensaries will be located.\nMarijuana investors, farmers and retailers typically start out with medical and then branch into recreational as their states legalize that, too. Many of them are pushing ahead, undeterred by Trump. Zach Lazarus, COO of the Green Alternative Medical Marijuana Dispensary in San Diego, and Priscilla Vilchis, CEO of Premium Produce, a medical marijuana company in Nevada, both said they're going to start selling recreational cannabis in accordance with state laws.\nRelated video: Will recreational marijuana soon be legal nationwide?\nBusiness is booming, and it's expected to grow. New Frontier Data, which analyzes the cannabis industry, projects that it could top $21 billion in annual sales by 2020 and employ 300,000 workers nationwide.\n\"Can we put the genie back in the bottle? Most people would say no,\" said Giadha Aguirre De Carcer, the firm's founder and CEO.\nJustin Olsen of New World Organics, a small dispensary and grower in Belfast, Maine, was considering expanding when the state voted to legalize recreational pot last year. He wants to serve recreational customers at his dispensary in addition to medical patients, and to open an Amsterdam-style cannabis caf\u00e9.\nBut the anti-marijuana rhetoric from the Trump administration has prompted him to take a \"wait and see approach.\"\n\"I believe that the attorney general will do what he says he's going to do,\" said Olsen, who doesn't want to risk the disruption to his business.\nBut given the widespread popularity of legalization, he's optimistic that the industry will triumph in the end.\n\"I think everybody's tired of the drug war,\" he said."}

{"id":"f9a5d054-5261-48c9-9bb5-0dcdc81545df","text":"Central Texans are expressing solidarity and concern after Saturday\u2019s deadly white supremacist and neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\nOn Sunday morning, about 10 strangers, all of them white, gathered in a room at the Triumphant Love Lutheran Church in Northwest Austin. Most were drawn by a post for a Facebook event, which said a Charlottesville solidarity event was being held at the church. After a few minutes of pleasantries, people began talking about their roles as allies.\n\u201cWe\u2019re mostly white folks here,\u201d said Austin resident Hans Maverick. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of tools online that explain how to really listen to people of color.\u201d\nSeveral other attendees echoed Maverick\u2019s points about the need to listen to the experiences of African- Americans and other people of color. Temple, Texas resident Cecily Luft drove about an hour to Austin to attend the gathering. Luft, who is in the process of converting to Judaism, said it was surreal to see images of Saturday's neo-Nazi rally.\n\u201cI went to Facebook, and I saw page after page of white men carrying torches\u2026 swastikas, and I immediately just had to turn it off,\u201d Luft said. \u201cI felt an overwhelming sense of, \u2018I can\u2019t let this happen without a fight.\u2019\u201d\nEventually the group grew to about 30 people. A few people of color, and the event organizer Margaret Haule, arrived. Haule, who is African American and the founder of Black Lives Matter Austin, led an hour-long discussion on racial tension and how to show support for minority groups. She fielded questions on everything from which charities to support to whether wearing safety pins on your shirt is an effective means of showing solidarity. Haule said Saturday\u2019s events in Charlottesville touched a nerve for many people, regardless of race.\n\u201cPeople need an outlet for what they were feeling, what they were experiencing,\u201d Haule said. \u201cThis was a way for people to express their pain, express their grief, and just to do a catharsis.\u201d\nHaule also said that in her experience, white people and even some minority groups tend to unload their stories of racist experiences and guilt onto African-Americans.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a time and place, and also, black people are not monolithic, so it\u2019s important that you tap into your humanity before you just assume that they want for you to bear your burden on them without them having the time to process their own burden,\u201d she said.\nOne man pushed back on Haule\u2019s statements, asking her whether the point of the event was to tell people everything they are doing wrong as allies. He said in his view, it was important to share stories of the human experience.\nOne of the few people of color in attendance was Margarita Bamba. She immigrated from the Philippines and recently became an American citizen. Bamba became emotional when talking to the group about raising her two young sons in a racially charged climate.\n\"I want to teach them what it means to be part of this country and do things that you believe in,\" Bamba said.\nSpeaking after the event, Bamba said that when people talk about being allies, it's important not to oversimplify the narratives of minority groups.\n\"When everybody was talking about people of color, I think I was grateful that there are so many white people here, but it felt almost like an out-of-body experience, like people were talking about me in the third person, like I wasn't in the room,\" she said. \"It's become this idea of people of color, that we're this monolithic group, and we're not.\"\nA white supremacist rally and a counter protest are planned for September 11th on the Texas A&M campus. Haule isn\u2019t directly involved in that counter protest, and she says she\u2019ll leave that effort up to local organizers in College Station, Texas. To those who want to be an ally, she says one of the most important things to do is listen."}

But the New Zealander was quick to credit the efforts of his backroom team in the unforgettable spring campaign. Rory Keane reports.\nAndy Farrell (defence coach)\nSaturday\u2019s win at Twickenham would have pleased Ireland\u2019s defence guru, for many reasons. This was his first visit back to England HQ since that ill-fated 2015 World Cup campaign.\nAndy Farrell, along with Stuart Lancaster, Mike Catt and Graham Rowntree, were given their P45s by the RFU after England failed to qualify from their pool.\nWhen Les Kiss left his role as defence coach with Ireland after the same tournament, Joe Schmidt needed a specialist to fill the vacancy. When Farrell was back on the market, it was no-brainer for the Kiwi.\nFarrell has been integral to Ireland\u2019s cause ever since. Ireland\u2019s defence came in for criticism in the early rounds particularly against Wales when the home side were exposed in the wide channels far too often for Farrell\u2019s liking. Ireland delivered their most aggressive and organised defensive performance in the final round.\nKeith Earls\u2019s tap tackle on Elliot Daly or Sean Cronin\u2019s last-ditch effort to prevent Mike Brown scoring in the corner had Farrell\u2019s imprint all over them.\n\u201cThe defence was incredible,\u201d said Johnny Sexton after the game.\n\u201cWe made Andy proud on the first day back in Twickenham for him.\u201d\nSimon Easterby (forwards coach)\nA mainstay of Schmidt\u2019s backroom team since he replaced John Plumtree as Ireland\u2019s forwards\ncoach in 2014, Simon Easterby has overseen a slick lineout operation as well as bringing many innovations to the pack.\nThe Grand Slam success was built on strong foundations, and the lineout has been one of Ireland\u2019s most consistent systems in Schmidt\u2019s green machine. Eddie Jones deliberately selected George Kruis, a highly-regarded lineout specialist, to disrupt Ireland\u2019s set piece last Saturday, but the Saracens lock never got near an Irish throw, save for one close-shave in the first-half.\nIreland finished with a 100 per cent success rate out of touch at Twickenham with all 14 for Rory Best or substitute Cronin\u2019s throws reaching their target.\nThe fact Ireland have achieved all of this without their totem Devin Toner, who filled a bench role for most of the championship, is all the more impressive. James Ryan has been working under Easterby since last summer\u2019s tour of the States and Japan and he has flourished under the former Ireland flanker\u2019s guidance.\nGreg Feek (scrum coach)\nFor the majority of this century, Ireland leaned heavily on John Hayes and Mike Ross to lock out the Ireland scrum. Munster tighthead Hayes carried the load from his first appearance in 2000 all the way up to his retirement from Test rugby in 2011.\nThankfully, Ross was there to take up the slack and was the cornerstone of the Irish pack for the following six seasons.\nDuring that period, Ireland were one injury away from a front-row crisis which came on a dark day against England at Twickenham back in 2012. When Ross left the fray early on that St Patrick\u2019s Day showdown, Tom Court was sent on to fill the void at tighthead. Ireland were pummelled and Greg Feek, sitting up in the coaches box, knew something had to be done.\nAlong with the IRFU\u2019s performance director David Nucifora and the union high-performance manager Collie McEntee, Feek has completely overhauled Ireland\u2019s front row factory.\nNow, Ireland have a batch of props that is the envy of the world. Tadhg Furlong is regarded as the premier tighthead in world rugby with able deputies in young Andrew Porter, a convert from loosehead at Feek\u2019s behest, and Munster\u2019s John Ryan.\nWhen Marty Moore completes his move to Ulster from Wasps this summer, Ireland\u2019s riches in this area will increase.The loosehead stocks are just as plentiful with Cian Healy and Jack McGrath battling for the jersey while Dave Kilcoyne, James Cronin and Finlay Bealham also in contention.Feek can be very pleased with his contribution to the cause.\nRichie Murphy (kicking and skills coach)\nAn unheralded member of Schmidt\u2019s backroom team. Murphy was a distinguished fly-half for Clontarf in his playing days and brings a calming presence to the squad.\nAs well as his excellent work with Ireland\u2019s kickers, Murphy is one of Irelands\u2019s \u2018water carriers\u2019 during Test matches and will deliver messages to the squad from Schmidt as well as offering guidance to Sexton and the other place-kickers. Murphy\u2019s finest work in this championship has been the evolution of Irish restarts.\nTaking inspiration from the All Blacks, Schmidt\u2019s side have became hugely competitive in this area.\nSexton\u2019s memorable drop goal in Paris was the culmination of a 41-phase assault but it began with Iain Henderson reclaiming Sexton\u2019s 22-metre drop out. Chris Farrell brilliantly reclaimed one of Sexton\u2019s restarts against Wales. It has become another string to Ireland\u2019s bow.\nThe Dubliner has worked with Sexton for many years and was alongside Schmidt when Leinster won back-to-back Heineken Cup titles in 2011 and 2012. When Ireland\u2019s No 10 rifled over that 45m drop goal in Paris, it was a just reward for the hours the pair have spent preparing for such scenarios.\nMurphy knew \u201cthe minute he hit it\u201d Sexton\u2019s kick would clear the crossbar at the Stade de France. He\u2019s seen enough of them.\nVinny Hammond (Video analyst)\nIt is a familiar sight for the players at Carton House, the IRFU High-Performance analyst is regularly spotted slumped over his computer, battling fatigue, pouring over footage in the late hours.\nHammond works closely with Schmidt and his coaching staff reviewing the squad\u2019s performances in training and games and prepares video packages of set piece, strike moves and defensive systems.\nSchmidt\u2019s Monday morning review sessions are infamous among the Irish camp; Hammond plays a key role in dissecting the details.\nA key player in the Ireland set-up for the best part of a decade, Hammond was brought on board by Warren Gatland for last summer\u2019s British and Irish Lions tour in New Zealand."}
{"id":"688dd91b-7d9f-4b9f-9857-ec037b470bc9","text":"Jammu: It is a rare moment when politicians of Jammu and Kashmir, cutting across the mainstream political spectrum, openly express their helplessness to influence a change in the state that has been torn apart by turmoil and militarisation over the last three decades. That moment came on Friday when the former chief minister and Leader of Opposition Omar Abdullah stood in the state Assembly to launch a scathing attack on Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti.\nInvoking the legendary German character Faust who, despite being highly successful yet dissatisfied with life, makes a pact with The Devil for exchanging his moral integrity and his soul in exchange for worldly gains, Omar compared the alliance of Peoples Democratic Party, of which Mehbooba is the president, with the BJP, as a pact of Faust with The Devil.\n\"Let us be honest,\" Omar said in the Assembly during his 45-minute speech, \"What sort of logical conclusion will you give to Shopian case when 47 out of 50 requests for prosecution of armed forces (allegedly involved in gross rights abuses, including murder, according to Jammu and Kashmir government probes) have been rejected by Centre since 2000 and three are pending.\"\nWhile Omar\u2019s admission of guilt on the floor of the house is an indictment of the failure of the elected governments in Jammu and Kashmir in giving justice to the people victimised by the 'black sheep' in armed forces over the last three decades, it also explains why the \u2018impotent\u2019 regional mainstream players don\u2019t enjoy a whiff of credibility or faith among the people.\nThe revocation of Armed Forces Special Powers Act, which gives sweeping powers to the army during counter-insurgency operations, also provides them with impunity from prosecution in civilian courts, if they were found to be involved in rights abuses. Omar\u2019s remarks in the Assembly only reaffirm the common belief that when it comes to dealing with the rogue elements in the armed forces deployed in the state, their hands are tied.\nIn his wax-eloquent speech, Omar squarely blamed the coalition government for the recent civilian killings, particularly in Shopian district, which he said is a \u201cstark reminder of the reality of our time in which we live\u201d. Omar said it has become a new routine of government to cage people in their homes on every Friday by imposing curfew and restrictions, \u201cPeople have been barred even from offering Eid prayers.\u201d\nIn her defence, Mehbooba again reiterated that the law will follow its own course. \u201cWe have lodged an FIR but I want to say this here that if there is someone who makes a mistake, there is a law for them. That doesn\u2019t mean everyone in the army is same or every soldier is an offender. These are the same forces who have brought a sense of security among people,\u201d Mehbooba said.\nBut it\u2019s not the AFSPA alone that has exposed the inability of the mainstream parties, like the ruling PDP and National Conference, in ensuring justice for the victims by punishing the culprits in uniform. There have been others occasions also where the state government has been literally forced to eat its words in the face of the pressure mounted by the armed forces to have their wishes granted while operating in Jammu and Kashmir.\nTake the issue of the high ground in south Kashmir\u2019s Anantnag district, for example, where the army occupies more than 2,000 kanals of land. While the decision to free a fertile 454 kanal patch at Fatehgarh from military occupation was taken years back with the then chief minister Mufti Sayeed even setting up deadlines and the Prime Minister's Office also intervening, the army refused to oblige and has not even paid the rent to the landowners.\nThe sheer powerlessness of Kashmir\u2019s political class is also reflected in their dealings with the governments at the Centre. While the PDP may have found it convenient to form an alliance with the party which is ruling at the Centre, its proposals for the social, political and economic empowerment of the state have not evoked much enthusiasm from the Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government.\nFrom the refusal to return two key power projects to the state government, presently under the operational control of the NHPC, to the \u201cdeliberate cuts\u201d in power infrastructure development component in the prime minister's Rs 80,000 crore plus package, the war of words between Mehbooba and Omar is also an indicator that the Centre puts its interests ahead of the interests of people of Jammu and Kashmir.\nKashmir\u2019s politicians may squabble inside and outside the Assembly, and bring each other down for petty gains, but in the process, they are slowly shredding the trust of those people who elected them in the first place. If Omar and Mehbooba can\u2019t give justice to victims of abuses by armed forces, pray, who will? This should worry us all."}

It should be noted that the Chairperson of the Gaming Commission has been consulted on the proposed amendments to the Bill and is supportive of the same.\n\u201cIt is the intent of this government to move forward with Gaming focused on creating economic growth, jobs and opportunities for Bermudians. As Bermudians continue to lose jobs in hotels while non-Bermudian jobs continue to grow, it is clear that economic growth, job creation and the expansion of entrepreneurial opportunities for Bermudians was what we have been elected to do and what we will do.\n\u201cWhat is clear is that for progress to occur in Bermuda, we must develop a renewed commitment to relationships based on trust and mutual respect. Where there is no trust and where there is no respect there will be no progress.\nMichael Dunkley\u2019s Comments\nMr Dunkley, the former Premier, said, \u201cOn September 22nd, 2017, I spoke on the Motion To Adjourn about the mounting concern that gaming might not happen in Bermuda. I spoke on the Motion To Adjourn about the mounting concern that gaming might not happen in Bermuda. I stated at that time if gaming is not set up properly it will not work for the betterment of Bermuda, our people and the investors.\n\u201cThere is much to do in any jurisdiction to build an effective framework for gaming; legislation and regulation are key to making it happen and allowing the operation of casino gaming, dealing with problem gaming and catching corruption and fraud.\n\u201cBermuda has made steady progress and since the inception of the Bermuda Casino Gaming Commission, under the guidance of Alan Dunch, the Commissioners and the BCGC led by Richard Schuetz, we were positioned to deal with the biggest remaining hurdle, that of obtaining a correspondent banking partner.\n\u201cHowever, since the election little has been done and in my view the BCGC has not had the support of the Government. Instead we have witnessed the Government trying to exert undue influence and control on a body that should be as independent as possible from the political process as experience has shown that politics and gaming do not mix.\n\u201cCouple this with the fact that the PLP has said little of what their vision for gaming is in their election platform, Throne Speech or comments from the Minister or Premier.\n\u201cThe future for gaming looks bleak especially with the passage of the Casino Gaming Amendment Act 2017, an amendment that is considered draconian by many, and if you don\u2019t believe me then just listen to industry experts.\n\u201cThe original Casino Gaming Act was passed in December of 2014 after a long debate. During that debate the PLP as the opposition raised no concern in anyway with the two sections of the act which were amended last Friday.\n\u201cSection 8 deals with Objects of the Commission and was amended to provide the Minister with greater control; being able to issue general directions which the commission must comply with.. Schedule 1 deals with the Constitution and Proceedings of the Commission and was amended to allow the Minister, at any time, to revoke the appointment of a member.\n\u201cOne wonders why no concern was raised in 2014, but now amendments are made?\n\u201cDuring the 2014 debate the PLP questioned many other sections but not a single word on these two. In fact they even tabled an amendment for another section which was not agreed. So why were these two sections ok to be passed in 2014 but not acceptable now?\n\u201cBermuda holds a hard earned reputation as an open and transparent jurisdiction where we do things right. This amendment has the potential to undermine that reputation and undermine the independence of the BCGC as it allows the Government, any Government, to provide unfettered direction.\n\u201cThis amendment takes away the independence of the commission, takes away the ability for critical thought, and takes away our hard earned reputation built in commerce, business and tourism.\n\u201cMy colleagues knew we had no ability to stop the legislation in the House but we also don\u2019t want to say in 1, 2 or 10 years down the road \u2018we told you so.\u2019\n\u201cI thought that in light of the fact that Mr. Dunch has resigned the legislation would be put on hold. But no the Government has decided to barrel forward in spite of advice from experts in the industry. This is a backward step.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wrong move, it\u2019s a bad move and it will backfire,\u201d Mr Dunkley said.\nRead More About\nCategory: All, News, Politics"}

For the next 2.2 kilometres, the van veered onto the curb, hitting pedestrians, killing 10 and injuring 14. Police arrested a suspect just south of Sheppard Ave. On Tuesday afternoon, people who work and live in the area emerged onto Yonge St. and gathered near caution tape and watched the quiet street. \u201cThis is an all-inclusive, friendly, tight community, and the best part of the city,\u201d said resident Stephen Voget, standing near Mel Lastman Square.

Fifty-one per cent of respondents in the StatsCan survey listed a language other than English or French as their home language. This is more than Toronto\u2019s average of 28 per cent of respondents who speak a nonofficial language at home. Within the ward, the top five languages spoken at home are Mandarin, Persian (Farsi), Korean, Cantonese, and Russian for close to 19,000 people surveyed. About 6.4 per cent of survey respondents do not speak either official language. Coun. John Fillon said there are large Chinese, Korean and Persian communities within his ward, which likely represent at least half of its residents.

Teenagers from the nearby Earl Haig Secondary School and Cardinal Carter Academy for the Arts frequent that part of Yonge St. at lunchtime.

Three men were shot and killed during an auto racing event at the facility, a Wisconsin sheriff said. (Photo: Terry Flores, Associated Press)\nThe three men shot to death at point-blank range Sunday night at Great Lakes Dragaway were gang members from Illinois, authorities said Monday.\nKenosha County Sheriff David Beth said the victims' gang affiliation leads authorities to suspect the shocking slayingswere gang-related. The killings happened during an event that drew 15,000 people to the popular drag racing strip near Union Grove.\nAuthorities were still searching for the shooter.\n\"I don't know who the suspect was or his motivation. It appears he walked up to the three that are now dead and basically just shot them point blank,\" Beth said at a news conference at the drag strip.\n\"He knew what his targets were. A third man ran around the side of the tent and he shot him and then returned to fire multiple shots into (the other two victims lying on the ground.) He had the arrogance to know that they were dead,\" Beth said.\nKilled were David L. Watson, 30, of Oswego, Ill.; Khalid R. Howard, 30, of Aurora, Ill.; and Derek K. Edwards, 26, of North Aurora, Ill. Edwards and Howard died at the scene while Watson died in an ambulance on the way to a local hospital.\nThe suspect was described as a black man, 20 to 30 years old, approximately 5-foot-9-inches tall, thin, athletic build and shaved hair on the sides but scruffy on top. Witnesses gave conflicting information about his clothing and he was seen running from the scene before leaving in a vehicle. Officials did not provide a description of the vehicle.\nThe murder weapon was a pistol, although authorities are unsure of the caliber. It was not recovered at the scene.\nGraphic cellphone video posted on Facebook shows two of the victims lying on the ground next to a blue open-air tent serving food adjacent to coolers and grills. Someone placed napkins over the faces of the victims who were clad in blood-spattered shorts and T-shirts.\nFamily members of the victims have not been helpful to authorities, the sheriff said. Authorities had difficulty identifying them and when a man who arrived at the Sheriff's Department identified himself as a father of one of the victims, he refused to provide his son's birth date and made demands of the department that were denied. The sheriff declined to elaborate on the father's demands.\nThe three victims were known to Aurora, Ill., police, officials said. Beth said the father of one of the victims is a high-ranking gang member from Illinois, and gang squad law enforcement members there confirmed the victims were gang members. The sheriff declined to identify the gang.\nIt took quite awhile to evacuate the chaotic scene Sunday night and sheriff's deputies remained at Great Lakes Dragaway throughout the night to preserve evidence across a large area.\nLarry's Fun Fest was described as a family-friendly event that included a car show, drag racing and tailgating with people bring barbecues and picnics. A private security firm worked the event but there was no screening of spectators for weapons.\n\"The whole goal of this was to get a group of people from Illinois and Chicago to come up here and race. When I was here, there were families, people of all ages. The attempt was to give people who don't normally come here a chance to have fun,\" said Beth.\nThe shootings happened in the parking area, the sheriff said, so even if there was screening for weapons, \"someone could easily have driven straight in and had guns.\"\nBeth said he didn't know why Great Lakes Dragaway was chosen by the shooter to kill the three men or how the suspect knew the victims would be at Larry's Fun Fest.\n\"Our detectives have not found anything to say why this was the spot where it occurred. I'm sure the suspect would know. I don't know if this is retaliation or a family trouble,\" said Beth.\nRead or Share this story: https:\/\/jsonl.in\/2wYhzFo"}

He is expected to arrive in Beijing for a visit Monday night. Given this sensitive timing, the media is speculating if he will make clear the US' military options against North Korea The war of words between Washington and Pyongyang has been escalating. The US said it would not give up diplomatic efforts, but it also signaled military strikes against North Korea.Most analysts believe neither the US nor North Korea would like to see a military showdown, but more and more people worry that miscalculation by the two may lead the situation to spiral out of control. South Korea should be the last one that wants war on the Korean Peninsula as it is bound to suffer if war breaks out.Seoul should make due contributions to stability in the peninsula, but it is not dedicated to doing so. South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared that there must be no war on the Korean Peninsula, which simply sounds like an empty slogan.From August 21 to 31, the US and South Korea will hold another joint military exercise called Ulchi-Freedom Guardian. The drill will definitely provoke Pyongyang more, and Pyongyang is expected to make a more radical response. If South Korea really wants no war on the Korean Peninsula, it should try to stop this military exercise. But the South Koreans can hardly get rid of US control, both in mind and deed.There are contradicting conflicts in the Korean Peninsula. Now that North Korea's missiles can reach as far as US soil, Washington has become more anxious than ever before. This proves that the North Korean nuclear crisis first reflects the contradiction between the US and North Korea. The biggest danger that could happen on the peninsula is a military clash between the two.Seoul should play the role of a buffer between the US and North Korea to prevent a head-on confrontation between the two. It is an ally of the US. It will have immediate effect if Seoul refuses to cooperate with Washington in launching military action against Pyongyang.China has friendly relations with North Korea, but it has no deciding leverage. It is more difficult for China to influence North Korea than for South Korea to influence the US.Once the situation on the Korean Peninsula worsens, South Korea will feel the impact sooner than China. While South Korea isn't helping extricate itself from this mess, it expects China to help it by imposing pressure on North Korea. It even cooperates with the US to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system on its soil to jeopardize China's interests.The South Koreans should have thought about what their real interests are. Now the destiny of South Korea is under the control of the US and North Korea. It is at the center of the political storm on the peninsula, while its role has been marginalized. The South Koreans should realize how absurd it is."}

{"id":"5bbdc718-4e68-4ec1-81bb-6af5a420d323","text":"Enanta Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ENTA) is a biopharmaceutical company focusing on three hepatitis C products in conjunction with AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) and Novartis (NYSE:NVS), but is developing therapeutics for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NYSEARCA:NASH) as well. ENTA has been profitable for five years, with licensing fees and milestone payments making up the bulk of ENTA's $330 million in revenue during that time. The company boasts impressive partnerships with big pharma and might be suffering just a bit from its own success.\nBefore one finishes yawning, let's address that some controversy lies around investing in Hepatitis C treatments, as sales in this market have started to slow. Believe it or not, up until a few years ago, there were only a few treatments for Hepatitis C. But recent advances have led to a competitive market space with increasing efficacy of new drugs in the once tough to treat indication. Consistent with this Hepatitis C drug costs (and therefore revenues in the space) have decreased. Additionally some of the roughly 2.5 million Americans afflicted with Hep C might be in an unreachable market. International markets are surely subject to limited access, but nonetheless offer attractive expansion opportunities. The fact that Hep C drugs are actually doing their job ironically is driving the market down via population immunity effect is also highly likely. So why would one suggest an investment in this saturated and declining market space? Is this a shorting opportunity?\nThis is no short candidate! It may well be ENTA that has deflated the market space and competition due to its superior Hep C treatment results. ENTA has impressive partnerships with AbbVie (ABBV) and Novartis (NVS). ENTA has a strong cash position of over 220 million dollars, enough to fund the company through the foreseeable future. ENTA debt is less than $3 million. The company has nice funding arrangements for development of its candidates as well, shouldering only part of its major development costs. Some of its royalty deals are mid-teens for thirty percent of sales. With a current market cap of only $615 million shorting doesn't seem like a good idea. Expansion of its treatments into international markets should expand its sales. With the market space cooling off, a pullback in price could be an opportunity for investors. Moreover, AbbVie\/Enanta is regarded by Strong Bio as in a superior position for Hep C market space having both medical superiority and competitive superiority.\nHere is the Strong Bio A,B, HepCs for a position in ENTA approaching August 2017:\nA ENTA stock undergoes a pullback (target $26) with the greater market sector (bio\/pharma) due to cyclical bear heading into Q3, returning biotechnology companies driven by Hepatitis C to previous oversold levels such as seen last year for all biotechnology\/pharma in lieu of political efforts to contain healthcare costs. Let's face it the economy is recovering slowly and recent optimism might have pulled away from reality. If a greater market sector pullback is accompanied by a targeted Hepatitis C space-driven company stock price pullback as well, let's call A the double-dip scenario, this would create a buying opportunity.\nB ENTA has no company-specific or market driven major setbacks or reasons that the stock price pullback is unique to the company. This would include a decrease in share price on unusually high sustained volume (in contrast to low or normal volume), management shakeups, pipeline candidate breakups, partnership pullouts, international market expansion failures, etc. Rather than make a list of generic risks associated with FDA approval, large scale manufacturing issues, etc. let us leave it to things seem to be going swimmingly for the company in spite of the double-dip scenario detailed in A.\nHepatitis C ENTA expects to launch its second partnered protease inhibitor product for G\/P HCV treatment, glecaprevir (Abt-493), in August with AbbVie. Milestone and royalty payments are expected to be significant for this event according to Jay Luly, CEO of Enanta. This event should be an inflection point for the stock in such a case, provided A and B occur (in contrast to a run-up in price which might result in a slow retraction in price of stock). If a reversal is formed, ENTA is a long-term hold at that point for Strong Bio. Because company fundamentals are sound, it is in a superior position for the Hepatitis C market, and more inflection points are coming in time.\nFor instance, NVS has agreed to pay $34 million of its third Hep C candidate manufacturing costs, plus up to $400 million in milestone payments through clinical trials and FDA approval for commercial rights to EDP-239 (Pibrentasvir, Abt-530) as well. It will be used in combination with Abt-493. The royalty is set in the mid-teens. This deal in and of itself is enough to nearly double the market cap for ENTA.\nENTA is not limited to Hep C either, as it is planning to use proceeds of its G\/P revenues and royalties to continue to develop its NASH\/PBC program (which unlike Hep C is a hot growth market space up for grabs for the foreseeable future), including a clinical trial launch of EDP-938 for RSV later this year.\nENTA is on the Strong Bio watchlist if these A, B, Hep C events occur. It is in a position of minimal risk and there is still plenty of meat on the bone for investors, especially if market trends can be used to take a contrarian position. The reason for this is simple, everyone remembers that ABBV is killing it in this area, but the market seems to be partially unaware how ABBV got there through ENTA. One major risk of long-term growth that must be taken into account for ENTA is the EDP-239 risk of clinical trial failure, possibly due to a hypothetical safety issue etc. However, after reviewing the overwhelming phase 2 results and literature on EDP-239, Strong Bio believes there is a very nice reward to low risk profile for the candidate. The potent and selective Hep C NS5A inhibitor has undergone resistance-associated variant analysis. Although it is true that certain mutations confer resistance to EDP-239, it shows promise and is well-tolerated as some mutations confer only partial resistance, and combinatory therapies are showing promise in limiting escape, having demonstrated 97% sustained virological response. Competition is also a risk, since Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD) and Merck (NYSE:MRK) have treatments with over 90% efficacy, but unless physicians are willing to roll the dice a bit on a lower cost treatment, ABBV\/ENTA treatments are superior for the foreseeable future. The competition seems to have thrown in the towel as well, as their lower estimates for the market space have conceded.\nDisclosure: I\/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

{"id":"8f662c21-d837-4ee9-bc6b-d2ceb7b59e4c","text":"By Andrew Elliott\nAs I have noted in a previous post, Sir Sandford Fleming\u2014inventor of International Standard time, creator of Canada\u2019s first postage stamp, surveyor and mapmaker\u2014was a productive individual in 19th-century Canada. He seemed to have time for many things, including recording his activities in various diaries. And Fleming was a voracious writer. While he didn\u2019t write novels, he did record everything he saw and experienced in his world. He combined his written observations with the occasional pencil sketch from landscapes, to people, to every day implements, to engineering works.\nRemarkably, these diaries were kept for most of his long life, dating from 1843 when he was 15, until his death in 1914. Being a man who also thought of how he would be perceived in posterity, in later life Fleming transcribed the most important parts of his diaries into three condensed diaries. Additionally, Fleming kept various journals that recorded many special trips across Canada, England and the United States. All these are here within the Sir Sandford Fleming fonds at Library and Archives Canada. See specifically the diaries, journals of trips and miscellaneous journals and notebooks.\nThere are many things of interest to read in these diaries. A couple of diaries from Fleming\u2019s early life are of particular interest. One dating from 1843 records his thoughts and observations about school life in Kirkcaldy, Scotland. Here there are numerous sketches from drawings of ships, a church, and a diagram of early roller skates.\nAnother two diaries from 1845 record Fleming\u2019s voyage\u2014mostly by ship\u2014from Kirkcaldy, Scotland to the town of Peterborough, Upper Canada. The first diary has handwritten entries for late April to early June 1845, while the second diary documents the remaining portion of the journey from June to August 1845. The second diary contains his visual documentation of the trip, a graphic record of a journey before photography. There are views of Scotland from on board the ship, sketches of ships passing by, sketches of his cabin and other people on board, views of the first sighting of landfall in North America, a view of Qu\u00e9bec City, a sketch of the locks at Bytown (now Ottawa), a view of Niagara Falls, and several sketches of Peterborough buildings.\nFleming arrived in Canada with valuable skills\u2014drawing, drafting, surveying, engraving\u2014and he used these to make a living. For Fleming, the diary was a way to record his movements, key events, and family events especially; he often made no entries if his day had been a routine one. The diaries contain irregular and brief entries noting board meetings, social engagements, arrivals and departures of prominent persons, health and fortune of family and friends, and travel in Canada and abroad. This last point about travel is particularly striking. While he was based first in Toronto, his work meant that he had to travel extensively. In the 1840s and 1850s, for example, despite having to travel by stagecoach, sleigh, and steamer, he would cover an area almost as extensive as the Greater Toronto Area. Later, while based in Halifax and Ottawa, numerous rail trips would see him frequenting remote parts of Ontario, Quebec, the Maritimes, and Western Canada.\nIn the early 1870s, Fleming travelled with others on a surveying expedition. A digitized record of this expedition can be found in Master-Works of Canadian Authors: Ocean to Ocean.\nAn 1885 diary has a pocket containing a six-page handwritten account of a train trip across Canada in November. Included in this account are his impressions of the November 7 ceremony at Craigellachie, British Columbia of the driving of the \u201clast spike\u201d to complete the Canadian Pacific Railway.\nHe also kept a list of all the trips he made by ship across the Atlantic Ocean. Here\u2019s a sampling for the period from the 1840s to the 1880s, such as a May 17, 1863 voyage to England on the S.S. United Kingdom.\nFleming also wrote about his personal and family life. Here are a few examples of diary entries from the 1850s and 1860s (spelling is his own):\nDecember 31, 185 9: \u201cAnother year on the eve of closing and here I am sitting in Mr. Halls family, Peterboro, with my good wife close by, two dear little boys, and little girl sound asleep in bed\u2026\u201d\nJune 6, 1861: He writes that his wife \u201cgave me my second little daughter about 12 o\u2019clock (noon) today at Davenport. She did not feel very well at breakfast and thought I had better go for the nurse and doctor.\u201d\nSeptember 9, 1863: \u201cMessrs Tilly and Tupper informed me that they had decided, subject to approval of their government) to appoint me to act on behalf of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick\u2026to proceed at once with survey.\u201d Here\u2019s a scanned image of an entry he made about the Intercolonial Railway survey:\nJanuary 1, 1864: \u201cMorning train to Collingwood, Stage to Craigleith\u2014Father and Mother had all their children around them\u2026they thought I was in New Brunswick and were astonished and glad to see me\u2026very cold and stormy.\u201d\nFebruary 28, 1866: Fleming writes about the death of his 3-month old son, \u201cThis morning about 4 o\u2019clock after rallying a little\u2026our dear child at last passed quietly away\u2026This is the first death that has really come home to me\u2014part of us is now really in another world.\u201d\nJune 29, 1867: \u201cPreparing for Celebration of Confederation of the Provinces next Monday.\u201d\nJuly 1, 1867 (Dominion Day): \u201cUp at 5 o\u2019clock, very cloudy and rainy\u2026putting up flags etc. Clouds cleared away. Halifax very gay, a perfect sea of flags. Beautiful day. The demonstration went off splendidly.\u201d\nAlthough Fleming was at the centre of the modernization of Canada, the hundreds of mundane details Fleming recorded also reveal something of the world he inhabited.

There is no known precedent for suicide bombings in the Philippines.\n(Reporting by Manuel Mogato; Editing by Martin Petty)"}

(AP) \u2014 The market for a peculiar type of clay is looking up thanks to improved prospects for oil and gas drilling and to cat owners who use the stuff to soak up their pets\u2019 business.\nOver 90 percent of all bentonite mined in the U.S. and almost half worldwide comes from beds of ancient volcanic ash in Wyoming. Some call bentonite the mineral of 1,000 uses: It clarifies wine and other alcoholic beverages, forms an impervious liner to keep landfills from leaking, removes ink during paper recycling, and goes into a slew of homeopathic remedies.\nBut two of the biggest uses are in kitty litter and drilling mud, the goop pumped down oil and gas wells during drilling to keep the bit cool and carry cuttings to the surface.\nAs the oil and gas industry\u2019s fortunes rise and fall, so can bentonite\u2019s. Over the past two years, bentonite mining companies that do a lot of business with the oilfield services industry suffered while the oil and gas industry experienced its worst slump in 20 years or more.\nAdvertisement\nNow, oil and gas prices have recovered somewhat, and petroleum companies look to drill more soon. Bentonite sales likewise show new signs of life, said Rick Magstadt, vice president of manufacturing for bentonite miner Wyo-Ben Inc.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to hex it by saying that I think it\u2019s going to be a lot better, but we expect a better year than we did last year,\u201d Magstadt said.\nBentonite assists drilling because of a property called thixotropy, which causes drilling mud to liquefy in the friction of drilling and solidify when the motion stops.\nCat litter has helped the industry ride out the oil and gas downturn, said Wyoming Mining Association Executive Director Travis Deti.\n\u201cThe pet litter industry has been very steady,\u201d Deti said. \u201cThat\u2019s a remarkable thing that I don\u2019t think people realize. We\u2019re kind of like the pet litter capital of the world.\u201d\nDrilling mud accounts for the largest portion of Wyo-Ben\u2019s business, while kitty litter and environmental lining round out the company\u2019s top three markets, Magstadt said.\nOther bentonite mining and processing companies focus almost exclusively on kitty litter, and business has been steady, said Tom Thorson, president of Black Hills Bentonite, which gets 80 to 90 percent of its business from Clorox and other companies that make kitty litter.\nBentonite kitty litter isn\u2019t terribly kind to the environment because it comes from surface mines and flushing the stuff, which can absorb up to 10 times its weight in water and swell up to 16 times its original size, isn\u2019t a good idea. Bentonite-based kitty litter \u2014 millions of tons a year \u2014 takes up space in landfills and doesn\u2019t decompose.\nBut alternatives, such as corn-based litter, haven\u2019t really caught on despite growing demand for environmentally friendly pet products, said Shannon Brown, an analyst with the market research firm Packaged Facts.\nCat owners often find that biodegradable kitty litters, which can be quite a bit more expensive, doesn\u2019t work as well as bentonite-based litters, she said.\n\u201cThey either don\u2019t like them or their cats don\u2019t like them. And so, in many cases, people will try them and then just go back to their standard, clay litter,\u201d Brown said.\nNationwide, sales of kitty litter approached $2.9 billion last year. Three-quarters of cat owners buy kitty litter and three-quarters of those buy clay clumping kitty litter, according to Packaged Facts.\nRecently the U.S. Bureau of Land Management approved Wyo-Ben\u2019s plans to expand a bentonite pit near Thermopolis in north-central Wyoming. It was a rare bit of good news for Wyoming\u2019s mining industry, hit hard by a downturn in coal and a recent BLM coal-leasing moratorium.\nWyoming, the top coal-mining state, produces about as much coal in four days as the state\u2019s nine bentonite mines do all year. The 4.3 million tons of bentonite mined nationwide last year was down 10 percent from the year before, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\nBentonite mining and processing continues to employ almost 700 people in Wyoming, thanks in no small part to cat owners.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound that sexy, but it\u2019s good for business,\u201d Magstadt said.\n___\nFollow Mead Gruver at https:\/\/twitter.com\/meadgruver"}

That\u2019s why more land is needed. Slowly all of them will come,\" he told AFP, adding families were already on the move to the new site.\nThe settlement being built by the army -- known as the Kutupalong Extension -- would be expanded by 1,000 acres to accommodate the enormous population, Maya said.\nHe said all refugees living in the 23 camps stretching along the border would be relocated to the new site, and the existing settlements closed. Two have already been shut down, he added.\nThe project has caused concern among doctors and charities on the ground who fear a disease like cholera could spread quickly through such a congested, overpopulated site.\nThe refugee crisis -- ignited by violence in Myanmar\u2019s westernmost Rakhine State on August 25 -- is the fastest and largest flow of people across a frontier since the Rwandan genocide in 1994.\nThe International Organisation for Migration (IOM), the lead UN agency handling the humanitarian crisis, says the situation is \"slowly spiralling into a catastrophe of biblical proportions\".\nCharities are struggling to feed and shelter the half a million new refugees who have flooded the camps, where cases of diarrhoea have doubled in the past week due to poor sanitation.\nMark Lowcock, a UN under secretary general for humanitarian affairs, said the world body would be seeking around $430 million to scale up the relief operation for the destitute Rohingya."}

It enters cities, villages, camps and clinics miles away, in the hearts of those who have fled.\nThe medical-humanitarian organisation, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res\/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) arrived in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine in May 2014 to provide free primary healthcare and psychological support to those living on land divided between the control of the Ukrainian Government and the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk People\u2019s Republics.\nSince arriving in Ukraine in January 2017, I have witnessed two harsh winters, which exacerbate the effect of having limited or no access to medical care on the (mainly) women living in the conflict zone. On my first visit to Granitne, a frontline village, one lady arrived with the insulin she needed to treat her diabetes in a plastic bag with a hot water bottle, to stop it from freezing on her journey to the clinic. The stories I have heard range from the loss of loved ones during shelling, the psychological trauma of living in dark, damp basements haunting villagers in their sleep, and unfortunately, for some, the loss of the will to live.\nThe conflict has broken up infrastructure, transport lines, and ripped apart the region\u2019s health system, with many healthcare staff leaving to safer areas. However, for fear of losing their homes and possessions, or for lack of opportunity to leave, many people have stayed.\nSixty percent of MSF\u2019s patients, caught up in the conflict and living along the frontline, are elderly and mostly women. They suffer from chronic diseases and need psychological support to manage the trauma they have experienced over the last three years.\nFor MSF, it is imperative to ensure that those who have left all their belongings, and in some instances homes they occupied since birth, can access medical care while on the move to safety.\nThis is not only to provide consistency in their access to medication for life-threatening chronic diseases but to keep psychological trauma at bay - a trauma intensified by the loss of support networks built up with neighbours and families that have had to separate.\nThe waiting room in Hospital One\nIn Mariupol, eastern Ukraine, MSF runs four mobile clinics for people who have fled home as a result of a four-year conflict between Ukrainian forces and those fighting for the self-proclaimed Donetsk People\u2019s Republic, in the Donbas region.\nIn Mariupol\u2019s Hospital One, in the east of the city, MSF staff use two small consultation rooms at the end of one of the hospital\u2019s dimly lit corridors to provide free access to a nurse, doctor and psychologist. The waiting room outside, with benches lining the walls, is quietly tense.\nAs with most of MSF\u2019s mobile clinics in eastern Ukraine, patients desperately await the doctor\u2019s door to open, many burdened with swollen legs and bad memories. But there is a marked difference in this clinic to those in villages close to the frontline, where despite the sound of shelling, despite a military presence, despite unpredictable public transport and closed health centres, those in the villages are still home.\nPatients in Hospital One remained guarded, watching on as one woman described to me her fear of an illness affecting the blood vessels in her brain, requiring intravenous treatment, and as another elderly lady, her arm in a cast, broke into muffled tears as she asked for support in receiving her missing pension.\nEventually, as one 58-year-old woman began to share her story, others chipped in, on the premise that although they all strictly wished to remain anonymous, with the hope of one day peacefully returning home, they felt their stories needed to be heard.\nAlongside diabetes, she had high blood pressure, cardiovascular problems and what she described as problems with blood vessels \u2013 which the MSF clinic for primary healthcare cannot treat.\n\u201cI live in a small village. We have a feldsher station (healthcare professional who provides emergency care), no pharmacy, no doctor, just a nurse practising,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe are IDPs, we stay in Mariupol because my husband has a job here at one of the steel plants.\u201d\nAlongside her husband she arrived in Mariupol in February 2015, during a period of heavy shelling.\n\u201cWe have no sleep at night, we are all nervous,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI can\u2019t sleep until 4am because of my nerves.

Trump took care of that!! Saved me 700 bucks this year!!!\u201d\n\u201cTrump removed the penalty for not having insurance.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Trump abolished the illegal penalty.\u201d\nThey\u2019re right \u2014 and wrong.\nOn Dec. 22, President Donald Trump did indeed sign a sweeping tax bill that repeals the Affordable Care Act\u2019s tax penalty by zeroing out the fines.\nOpponents of the tax penalty rejoiced, and many, like Rick, Patrick and Michael, assumed it took effect immediately.\nNot so. The penalty won\u2019t go away until 2019, and that means you still will owe Uncle Sam if you didn\u2019t have health insurance \u2014 or an exemption from the mandate \u2014 in 2017. The same holds true for this year.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just mass confusion out there,\u201d reports Steven Stasoiski, a tax accountant and insurance agent in Seal Beach.\nSome of his clients decided to drop their health insurance this year without consulting him first, thinking they wouldn\u2019t have to pay a penalty next year. \u201cWhen they file next season \u2026 they\u2019re going to be surprised,\u201d he says.\nOne client, a family of four in Orange County, decided to go without insurance this year, and will owe about $15,200 next year because of it \u2014 roughly the same cost as a bronze-level health insurance plan that would protect them from catastrophic health insurance bills, Stasoiski says.\nUnder Obamacare, most people must have health insurance or pay a tax penalty. For 2017, the penalty is $695 per adult (up to a family maximum of $2,085), or 2.5 percent of household income, whichever is greater. The penalty for children is half the adult rate ($347.50).\nYou can avoid the penalty if you qualify for one of the health law\u2019s several exemptions. For instance, you may be exempt if you were uninsured for less than three consecutive months of the previous year, if your income is low enough that you\u2019re not required to file a federal tax return or if you belong to a health care sharing ministry.\nBut if you don\u2019t fit into one of the exemption categories and you were uninsured in 2017, or will be in 2018, you\u2019re probably out of luck, says Alison Flores, a principal tax research analyst at the Tax Institute, the research wing of H&R Block, based in Kansas City, Mo.\n\u201cIf you have a penalty and you\u2019re due a refund, that penalty reduces your refund,\u201d she says. If you owe a penalty but aren\u2019t owed a refund, and then you decide not to pay the penalty, the Internal Revenue Service may take it out of a future refund, she says.\nThe IRS says that this year, for the first time, it will reject electronically filed tax returns that don\u2019t address Obamacare tax penalty questions. If you file a paper return and don\u2019t address those questions, your return could be held up and a refund delayed, adds Michael Eisenberg, a certified public accountant with Squar Milner in Encino, Calif.\n\u201cThey are saying, \u2018This is the law, and you have to comply with the law while it\u2019s the law,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThey are going to enforce the penalties.\u201d\nA quick note on the Obamacare-related 1095 tax forms, which will help you prove to the IRS that you had health insurance last year.\nSome of you who got insurance last year from employers, on the open market or through government programs such as Medicare or Medi-Cal, may still be waiting for your 1095-B and 1095-C forms. The IRS extended the deadline to March 2 for those forms to be delivered to taxpayers.\nBut you don\u2019t need them in hand to complete your taxes, which are due on April 17this year. \u201cYou should have other substantiation that you had health insurance,\u201d such as W-2 forms, Medicare cards or explanations of benefits from your insurance company, Flores says.\nOn the other hand, you must have a correct 1095-A to complete your taxes. If you\u2019re a Covered California enrollee \u2014 or buy your insurance through any state or federally run health insurance exchange \u2014 you should have received your 1095-A forms by Jan. 31.\nRelated Articles Patients overpay for prescriptions 23% of the time, analysis shows If you\u2019re still waiting for yours and you\u2019re a resident of the Golden State, log on to your Covered California account and check your inbox.

A Look at the Never-Ending Race for the Biggest Horns in Texas\nTexas Longhorn M Arrow Cha-Ching (at 129.5 inches, the longest current total horn length) on Richard Filip\u2019s ranch. Photo by Gabriel C. P\u00e9rez\/Texas Standard\nIn 1941, Texas folklorist J. Frank Dobie published \u201cThe Longhorns\u201d \u2013 the definitive book on the quintessential Lone Star State livestock. Dobie was unsparing in his description of the breed, calling them bony, thin-flanked, some even grotesquely narrow-hipped, but also uniquely suited for the Texas terrain. They were built for survival, not show, which makes them quite different from their modern relatives.\nBy Michael Marks, Texas Standard\nOn auction day for longhorns at the Fort Worth Stock Show and Rodeo \u2013 one of the biggest sales of the year \u2013 85 or so cows are coaxed into a half-circle sale pen in front of the buyers and sellers. There are lots of cattle auctions at the stock show \u2013 Herefords, Brahman, Santa Gertrudis. And by and large, those look like a parade of the same animal over and over again.\nBut not the longhorns. Here, there\u2019s something different for everyone. There are beefy chestnut-colored bulls, blue roan cows with parallel horns, fluffy, black-and-white calves with little spikes just starting to sprout. And these are not just any longhorns. These are registered longhorns, which means their bloodlines have carefully curated and logged.\nToday, the average lot sells for just under $4,500, with the top cattle bringing in over $10,000 apiece. The buyers are mostly folks who got into this as hobby, but now are hooked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a want-not-need market. They really don\u2019t need these cows. They want them. They fall in love with these animals. They\u2019re very addictive, they\u2019re beautiful animals, they\u2019re very docile animals,\u201d says auctioneer Joel Lemley.\nHe breeds longhorns, too. He\u2019s been doing it for about 25 years. If you ask him, or most anyone else in Fort Worth, how the industry has changed in that time, they\u2019ll tell you the same thing. Take Dick Lowe of the Triple R Ranch in Horton, Michigan, or John Marshall, who raises longhorns at the Blue Ridge Ranch in Llano.\n\u201cWhen I got in,\u201d Lowe says, \u201cif you had a bull that had 60 inches of horn you were kicking butt. And today, if they\u2019re not 60 by two, you throw them under the bus.\u201d\nMarshall agrees.\n\u201cWhen I got into this 10 years ago, if you had a cow in the 60s, tip-to-tip, it was a big deal,\u201d he says. \u201cAll my cows are in the 70s or I don\u2019t even have them anymore.\u201d\nIn a short period of time, horn size for registered longhorns has grown exponentially, and so has the money it takes to buy them. Chase Vasut raises longhorns in Elgin and is the director of operations at the Texas Longhorn Cattle Association.\n\u201cWhen we got into the industry there was one cow who tip to tip measured 90 inches,\u201d Vasut says, \u201cand looking today there\u2019s 55 of them.\u201d\nOne of those sold last March at an auction put on by Vasut\u2019s group. Bidding on one cow in particular got out of hand.\n3S Danica was three years old at the time, with horns over 90 inches across \u2013 huge for any longhorn, much less a young one. The bids cleared $50,000, then 100, then 200, then 300, until finally 3S Danica sold for $380,000 \u2013 a record for a single longhorn.\nThe reason she was so expensive is that the buyers weren\u2019t just after her, they were after her genetics, her future offspring. A cow so young with horns so long represents a giant leap forward in the never-ending race for the biggest horns. Bigger horns mean bigger bragging rights and bigger bucks.\nBut some folks in the business have started to wonder: how big is too big?\n\u201cYou\u2019ve put your finger on what is to me a very hot topic,\u201d Marshall says.\n\u201cThe original longhorn was a scrawny tough little survivor,\u201d Marshall says. \u201cAt some point you\u2019ve\u2026they cease to be longhorns after a while, they get to be monsters,\u201d says John Marshall of Llano.\nA scrawny little survivor is not how you\u2019d describe today\u2019s animals, but that\u2019s what they were. Their ancestors crossed the Atlantic with Christopher Columbus, and then fed friars and conquistadors at Spanish missions in the New World. Here and there they\u2019d escape, and create fugitive populations in the south Texas scrub.\nThat\u2019s where longhorns became longhorns. Centuries in the brush made them tough and wily, keener and more resilient than domestic cattle. In the mid-1900s, though, they became more valuable as pasture ornaments than as ribeyes. Technology like selective breeding, artificial insemination and in vitro fertilization followed. Since then, breeders have tried to win the horn race while maintaining the other qualities that set the breed apart. Some succeed, others don\u2019t.\n\u201cAnytime that you chase after just one genetic, you\u2019re going to have issues,\u201d says Russell Fairchild, a longhorn consultant and breeder.\nHeavy horns on a skinny body can wear down joints, and cause hooves to distort.\n\u201cYou have one that\u2019s broke down in the legs, she\u2019s not going to continue to get pregnant. Means you don\u2019t get as many calves, means you don\u2019t get as much money on your investment,\u201d Fairchild says.\nThis is about the health of individual cows, and maintaining the traits of a Texas icon.\nTake horn shape, for example. It used to be unusual for horns to stick out horizontally. In Dobie\u2019s 1941 book on the breed, he wrote that twists were characteristic of Texas horns.\nNow the reverse is true. Horns that shoot straight out to maximize tip-to-tip length are more common. So now, this trait that was once a hallmark of the breed has become rare, and lately, more valuable as a consequence.\nSo breeders like Richard and Jeanne Filip are trying to bring that trait back into their herd. On their 240-acre ranch between San Antonio and Austin, the Filips are breeding for big horns, but also for classic, healthy traits.\n\u201cJust overall conformation, outstanding genetics they\u2019re going to throw to their offspring,\u201d Richard Filip says.\nRichard drives me over to a pen with three heifers that are almost a year old. All three are daughters of the same cow, born within a week of each other through in vitro fertilization.\n\u201cBut you can see this one\u2019s got more horn again, her dam was bred to the 101-inch bull. So she\u2019s already getting outstanding horn,\u201d Filip says. \u201cThat\u2019s twice as much horn as a heifer her size would normally have.\u201d\nThe standout\u2019s name is RJF Dreammaker. Her father is Cowboy Tuff Chex, a Guinness World Record holder for bull with the biggest horns. Dreammaker\u2019s horns are only about 28 inches tip-to-tip. But if her parents are any indication, they\u2019ll grow at least another 70 inches.\nShe\u2019s the product of both living wild for centuries in the Texas scrub and the most advanced modern breeding \u2013 a top contender to lead the horn race for a while, and protect the other traits that make a longhorn a longhorn."}

A ball down the middle was flicked on by Gordon Cuddington and Greenall turned neatly on the edge of the box before unleashing a left-foot shot on the angle which flashed across the goalkeeper into the far corner.\nNumber three came from the penalty spot. Greenall got to a throughball just before the goalkeeper and chested it past him only to be cleaned out as he did so. The reliable Craig Ottley tucked away the resulting penalty.\nThe fourth goal was straight off the training ground. Some good, free-flowing football ended with Greenall delivering a cross from the left-hand side of the area for Kevin Barden to score with a fine finish into the top corner.\nThere was still time for one more before the break.

A new mission and an increased focus on producing content that can benefit entrepreneurs has made all the difference, Signorelli said.\n\u201cThe Techweek mission now is to to spread wealth creation across diverse places and people through supporting the emergence of hero companies,\u201d she said, referring to high-growth tech companies.\nIn 2017, Signorelli is requiring Techweek sessions \u2014 across nine markets \u2014 to deliver results tied to the mission or be cut. In the past, the weeklong conference was known more for its concerts, parties and marketing missteps that drew charges of sexism.\nThe result this year is a shift away from quantity in favor of a greater emphasis on content tied to particular themes \u2014 this year\u2019s being \u201cgrowth\u201d \u2014 as well as the replacement of preconference entertainment events with panels, she said.\nThe savings of running a slimmed-down event in Chicago this year are offset by the costs of increasing production value, bringing in outside help to nab speakers and investing in more staff during the events, she said.\nSignorelli, formerly a consultant at McKinsey and Company, said the company instituted its new mission in November. Techweek is in the process of becoming a public benefit corporation, a structure that requires companies to balance community impact with fiduciary responsibilities. Signorelli said she hopes the transition will be complete before Techweek Chicago next week.\nThe events will run June 19 to 23, with just a single full day and a smattering of evening events. It kicks off with a welcome party Monday evening at MillerCoors\u2019 headquarters. The next evening features a financial tech event at Capital One, a platinum sponsor. On Wednesday evening, there\u2019s a two-hour showcase of nine startups at Bottom Lounge \u2014 replacing what used to be a 100-company pitch competition.\nA full day of sessions at Venue Six10 packs Thursday, starting with a women in tech breakfast. That will be followed by a Growth Summit, featuring panel discussions touching on topics such as raising capital for growth, merging or buying companies and attracting customers.\nOn Friday, Techweek Chicago will wrap up with a day of community events and an evening reception at 1871 for Techweek Gives, the culmination of a 90-day campaign aimed at raising $1 million worth of goods, time and money from local technology companies to benefit nonprofits in the science, technology, math, arts and engineering (STEAM) space. By Wednesday morning, the campaign had brought in more than $302,000 in cash, more than $1 million in goods and more than 4,100 volunteer hours.\nSignorelli said she expects Techweek Chicago to attract about 10,000 attendees this year, down from about 12,000 in 2016 \u2014 when the event first began cutting back and shifted away from the Merchandise Mart \u2014 and about 13,000 in 2015. She acknowledged the emphasis on networking rather than partying may turn off some past attendees. But she said she hopes it will attract new attendees, who may have disregarded Techweek for the same reason.\n\u201cWhen we think about what we want to get out of the mission, the goal is to generate some sort of ability for people to get talent or capital or knowledge,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t necessarily go back and say how in 2017, being able to throw a big party would also generate the ability to fulfill those requirements.\u201d\nAlong with tweaking the format in Chicago, Signorelli is evaluating Techweek's presence in cities such as Detroit, where this year it held a reception as part of a larger startup week hosted by local organizations Opportunity Detroit and Detroit Startup Week, rather than a full conference of its own. She said the model allowed Techweek to get feedback on its event and that it could use this format to test new markets before committing to full conferences there.\nToday, Techweek employs 12 people full-time, as well as some part-time help. Techweek remains owned by Chicago-based Guild Capital. Signorelli said she may consider going out for funding in the future, but for the short term, her plan is to keep tweaking the Techweek formula.\naelahi@chicagotribune.com\nTwitter @aminamania"}

This annual rush to the finish line creates a major opportunity for fraudulent tax preparers who charge inflated fees and file inaccurate returns to claim bogus refunds.\n\"The vast majority of tax preparers are ethical and will file your taxes completely and safely,\" said John Breyault, who runs Fraud.org, a project of the National Consumers League. \"However, if you use a preparer you don't know and trust, you could pay much more out of pocket than you should to have your taxes done. This also puts you at greater risk of fines, fees or an IRS audit, if they file an incomplete or incorrect return.\"\nPaid preparers are an integral part of the U.S. tax system. They do about 60 percent of all the returns each year, according to the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS recently warned about unscrupulous preparers, calling it one of the most common \"Dirty Dozen\" tax scams.\nThese dishonest businesses \"prey on unsuspecting taxpayers with outlandish promises of overly large refunds,\" the IRS said in a news release. Some also commit identity theft with the sensitive private information clients give them in order to prepare their return.\n\"Choose your tax return preparer carefully because you entrust them with your private financial information that needs to be protected,\" IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said in a statement.\nIn many cases, the taxpayers whose returns are falsified are innocent victims, unaware of what's happening. But sometimes, they do know and agree to the fraudulent filing because they're going to get such a large refund, said Kenneth Hines, former Special Agent with IRS Criminal Investigations and founder of Hines Consulting USA.\n\"If you go along with making up the numbers \u2014 false expenses or deductions, extra dependents or incorrect filing status \u2014 you could face fines or criminal charges for filing a false return,\" he said.\nHines shared a few \"red flags\" that signal a preparer is dishonest:\nThey want you to sign a blank return. You wouldn't sign a blank check; don't sign a blank return.\nThey say their fee is based on the size of your refund. This is a violation of IRS rules because it's an incentive to cheat.\nThey try to talk you into something you don't feel comfortable with, such as \"Everyone is claiming a home office deduction, so you should, too.\"\nThey claim to have super-secret ways to lower your tax bill that the IRS doesn't want you to know about.\n\"Victims would always tell us they felt something was wrong, but because they were getting a big refund, they went along with it,\" Hines told NBC News. \"You can't throw up your hands and say someone led me down this path. You are responsible because it's your return, period.\"\nTrying to Catch the Bad Apples\nFederal prosecutors have been actively going after these tax cheats. Just last week, three former preparers were sentenced to prison:\nA tax preparer in Rosenhayn, New Jersey, got a year in prison for filing false federal income tax returns for at least four years. Noemi Pender and her co-conspirator defrauded the treasury out of more than $340,000 by getting their clients refunds greater than they were legally entitled to receive, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.\nThe government said Pender Tax Services created phony dependents and bogus deductions, claimed non-existent credits for education and child care, and falsely claimed the filer was the head of household.\nA federal judge in Orlando ordered Jason Stinson, a businessman from central Florida, to pay a civil penalty of nearly $950,000 for preparing false returns. Stinson owned Nation Tax Services with offices in Florida, Alabama, Georgia and North Carolina. He was charged with getting inflated refunds for clients by fabricating dependents, business expenses and charitable contributions.\nThe court found that Stinson's companies targeted \"underprivileged, undereducated poor people\" who were charged more than $600 \u2014 sometimes as much as $999 \u2014 to prepare a single return. Sometimes those fees would be taken out of the customer's refund, so they never knew about it, according to the Justice Department. The court permanently prohibited Stinson from owning or operating any tax return preparation business.\nA woman in Omaha, Nebraska, was sentenced to 18 months in prison for tax fraud. Lisa Holmes admitted to creating false tax returns in order to get several clients larger refunds. The Justice Department release noted that the court also ordered her to pay $48,000 in restitution, noted.\nDishonest tax preparers also try to cheat tax collectors in states with an income tax. Earlier this month, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey charged a tax preparer in her state with pocketing more than $150,000 in state funds since 2009. The lawsuit claims the company, Tax Enterprises, filed about 300 falsified returns that claimed more than $2 million in fraudulent deductions.\nNo Qualifications Required for Most Tax Preparers\nIn all but four states \u2014 California, Maryland, New York and Oregon \u2014 anyone can call themselves a tax preparer and charge for their services. They're not required to meet any minimum educational competency or training standards.\n\"That's why we are very concerned about the issue of preparer competency,\" said Chi Chi Wu, staff attorney with the non-profit National Consumer Law Center.\nThat concern is based on several rounds of mystery shopping done by NCLC, government investigators and other consumer advocates.\n\"We found high levels of errors in the returns that were prepared, as well as outright fraud, in some cases,\" Wu told NBC News. \"We were amazed and shocked.\"\nIn one case, a preparer simply made up $9,000 of business expenses, she said. Another advised the mystery shopper to claim the Earned Income Tax Credit when she didn't qualify for it.\nThe IRS tried to address this problem by creating a mandatory registration and certification program, but that was stopped by the D.C. Court of Appeals in 2014. Tax preparers who want to show they're qualified can take a voluntary test to be certified by the IRS. Certain tax preparers, such as Certified Public Accounts (CPAs) and enrolled agents, do have special training and must pass tests to prove it. The IRS has a directory of credentialed preparers and tips on how to choose a tax professional on its website.\nFree and Trustworthy Help Available\nMillions of Americans can take advantage of various free or inexpensive tax preparation services.\nThe Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program offers free tax help to people who want to prepare their own returns. VITA is for taxpayers who make $54,000 or less a year and those with disabilities or limited English skills. IRS-certified volunteers provide free basic income tax return preparation with electronic filing to qualified individuals.\nThe Tax Counseling for the Elderly program offers free tax help for all taxpayers 60 years of age and older. The IRS-certified volunteers specialize in questions about pensions and retirement-related issues unique to seniors. Find out more about VITA and TCE on the IRS website.\nThe AARP Foundation's Tax-Aide program offers free, individualized tax preparation for low-to moderate-income taxpayers \u2014 especially those 50 and older \u2014 at more than 5,000 locations nationwide.\nIf your adjusted gross income was less than $64,000 last year, you qualify for the IRS Free File program. This year you can choose filing software from a dozen brand-name software companies to file your federal return for free. Some of these programs also make it possible to file state returns for free.\nThere's no income requirement for those who want to use the free commercial software programs on the market that let you file for free. The editors at Kiplinger's Personal Finance recently reviewed seven of these programs and found two they really liked that prepare both state and federal returns: H&R Block More Zero, for taxpayers who file 1040EZ or 1040A and those who itemize and claim the most common deductions; and Credit Karma Tax."}

Three of them shared their stories on NBC News\u2019 Megyn Kelly Today on Monday, December 11.\nFirst up was Samantha Holvey, who competed in the Miss USA pageant in 2006. She claims Trump would walk into dressing rooms and inspect each contestant.\n\u201cIt was heartbreaking last year.

{"id":"3231c5d3-926e-4398-81b5-28dfc4719ac2","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Saturday claimed complete vindication from a congressional memo that alleges the FBI abused its surveillance powers during the investigation into his campaign\u2019s possible Russia ties. But the memo also includes revelations that might complicate efforts by Trump and his allies to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s inquiry.\nThe four-page document released Friday contends that the FBI, when it applied for a surveillance warrant on a onetime Trump campaign associate, relied excessively on an ex-British spy whose opposition research was funded by Democrats. At the same time, the memo confirms that the investigation into potential Trump links to Russia actually began several months earlier, and was \u201ctriggered\u201d by information involving a different campaign aide.\nChristopher Steele, the former spy who compiled the allegations, acknowledged having strong anti-Trump sentiments. But he also was a \u201clongtime FBI source\u201d with a credible track record, according to the memo from the House Intelligence Committee chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., and his staff.\nThe warrant authorizing the FBI to monitor the communications of former campaign adviser Carter Page was not a one-time request, but was approved by a judge on four occasions, the memo says, and even signed off on by the second-ranking official at the Justice Department, Rod Rosenstein, whom Trump appointed as deputy attorney general.\nTrump, however, tweeted from Florida, where he was spending the weekend, that the memo puts him in the clear.\n\u201cThis memo totally vindicates \u2018Trump\u2019 in probe,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their (sic) was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because, after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING, collusion is dead). This is an American disgrace!\u201d\nThe underlying materials that served as the basis for the warrant application were not made public in the memo. As a result, the document only further intensified a partisan battle over how to interpret the actions of the FBI and Justice Department during the early stages of the counterintelligence investigation that Mueller later inherited.\nSome Republicans are citing the memo, released over the objections of the FBI and Justice Department, in their arguments that the Mueller investigation is politically tainted.\nA closer read presents a far more nuanced picture.\n\u201cHaving decided to cherry-pick, the Nunes team picked a bunch of the wrong cherries for its own narrative,\u201d Matthew Waxman, a Columbia University professor and former Bush administration official, wrote in an email.\nThe memo\u2019s central allegation is that agents and prosecutors, in applying in October 2016 to monitor Page\u2019s communications, failed to tell a judge that the opposition research that provided grounds for the FBI\u2019s suspicion had been partially funded by Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee.\nPage had stopped advising the campaign sometime around the end of that summer.\nRepublicans say a judge should have known that \u201cpolitical actors\u201d were involved in allegations that led the Justice Department to believe Page might be an agent of a foreign power \u2014 an accusation he has consistently and strenuously denied.\nSteele\u2019s research, according to the memo, \u201cformed an essential part\u201d of the warrant application. But it\u2019s unclear how much or what information Steele collected made it into the application, or how much has been corroborated. Steele was working for Fusion GPS, a firm initially hired by the conservative Washington Free Beacon to do opposition research on Trump. Steele didn\u2019t begin work on the project until after Democratic groups took over the funding.\nThe FBI this week expressed \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about the memo and called it inaccurate and incomplete. Democrats said it was a set of cherry-picked claims aimed at smearing law enforcement and that releasing the memo would damage law enforcement and intelligence work.\nFor one, Democrats said Friday that it was misleading and incorrect to say a judge was not told of the potential political motivations of the people paying for Steele\u2019s research.\nBeyond that, though, the memo confirms the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign began in July 2016, months before the surveillance warrant was sought, and was \u201ctriggered\u201d by information concerning campaign aide George Papadopoulos. He pleaded guilty last year to lying to the FBI and is cooperating with Mueller\u2019s investigation.\nThe timing makes clear that other Trump associates beyond Page, who was part of the election effort for only a short period and was not in Trump\u2019s inner circle, had generated law enforcement scrutiny. The memo also omits that Page had been on the FBI\u2019s radar a few years earlier as part of a separate counterintelligence investigation into Russian influence.\nThe memo focuses on Page, but Democrats on the House committee said \u201cthis ignores the inconvenient fact that the investigation did not begin with, or arise from Christopher Steele or the dossier, and that the investigation would persist on the basis of wholly independent evidence had Christopher Steele never entered the picture.\u201d\nOther details in the memo could also challenge Republican claims of bias. The warrant requested was renewed on three additional occasions, meaning that judges approved it four times. One of the Justice Department officials who signed off on it was Rosenstein, a Trump appointee.\nTrump, who lambasted the FBI and Justice Department on Twitter, was asked if he was more likely to fire Rosenstein and if he still had confidence in the official. The president simply said, \u201cYou figure that one out.\u201d\nThe memo had been classified because it deals with warrants obtained from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The White House declassified it Friday and sent it to Nunes for immediate release.\nThat disclosure is extraordinary because it involves details about surveillance of Americans, national security information the government regards as among its most highly classified. The release is likely to further escalate the conflict between the White House and Trump\u2019s law enforcement leaders.\nRosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray had personally lobbied against the memo\u2019s disclosure, arguing it could set a dangerous precedent.\nThe memo\u2019s release also comes amid an effort by Trump and congressional Republicans to discredit Mueller\u2019s investigation. His probe focuses not only on whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia but also on whether the president sought to obstruct justice."}

After releasing one album under his own name in 2004, My Hotel Year, Bowness\u2019 solo career began in earnest with Abandoned Dancehall Dreams in 2014, which was initially conceived as the follow-up to No-Man\u2019s 2008 album Schoolyard Ghosts.\n\u201cIt was something I discussed with Steven Wilson and we were set to do it,\u201d says Bowness, \u201cbut then eventually Steven was too busy with his solo career and said, \u2018Look, I think this is mainly you anyway so why doesn\u2019t it become the start of your solo career?\u2019\u201d\nWorking alone proved inspiring. \u201cI found a voice while making the album that was quite different from my voice in No-Man, from my voice in Memories Of Machines or other projects I\u2019ve been involved in,\u201d he says.\nStupid Things That Mean The World followed in 2015, setting the stage for Lost In The Ghost Light, where Bowness examines the changing nature of the music industry and popular culture through his fictional rock star who has fallen from grace.\n\u201cThere are people from that late 60s and 70s creative explosion who retained their idealism, their vision, but equally there are people who, due to commercial pressures or collapsing family lives or merely disinterest and indulgence, lost their way,\u201d he says.\n\u201cIn some ways, I was trying to map a progression of music through a particular type of musician who would have felt very threatened by the late-1970s punk and New Wave explosion, one who would have suddenly felt perhaps irrelevant after being feted. Certainly, I\u2019ve met musicians who this happened to, very good musicians who were completely derailed by the process, actually felt worthless because of the press abandonment and who questioned the nature of their own work.\u201d\nAlthough Lost In The Ghost Light is a solo release, Bowness wanted the music to have the feel of a band behind it. \u201cI\u2019ve been restricting myself to certain sound palettes,\u201d he says. \u201cWith a lot of solo projects they can be quite diffuse, so for me, from album project to album project, I wanted them to be very focused in terms of the sounds used, the musicians used and the way it comes across as a coherent, almost band-oriented whole.\u201d\nHe also didn\u2019t want to release a sprawling, unfiltered flood of music. \u201cI was very aware that when you\u2019re working on your own, indulgence is a possibility so perhaps I\u2019ve been far stricter on myself than I would be even in collaboration. I\u2019ve been anticipating criticism and I think when you have a very specific idea of what you want, let\u2019s say on a particular vocal take, nothing else will do.\u201d\nThis pursuit of the perfect take meant that on two songs, Moonshot Manchild and You\u2019ll Be The Silence, more than 50 hours went into realising the final vocal track. \u201cLeft to my own devices, part of the problem is that yes, 50 hours can go on one particular vocal take,\u201d Bowness admits. \u201cBut this is not the case for all of it. A couple of tracks on the album were pretty much first or second takes and I knew they worked and so there was no questioning, there was no point in going back. It wasn\u2019t about technical perfection: it\u2019s more about the feel that you want for the song, the expression for the song. If I wasn\u2019t hitting what I heard in my head, I would do it again and again.\u201d\nBowness drew upon the talents of an impressive group of players to craft the band\u2011oriented sound he was after, with Henry Fool\u2019s Stephen Bennett on keys, bassist Colin Edwin, Pineapple Thief\u2019s Bruce Soord on guitar and the drumming talents of both Hux Nettermalm and Andrew Booker, plus guest appearances from two prog legends, Kit Watkins and Ian Anderson. However, they were never all in the same place at the same time: everyone recorded their parts remotely.\nTim Bowness: going solo for his ambitious third concept album (Image: \u00a9 Kevin Nixon)\n\u201cOn the previous two albums I\u2019d assemble a band in the studio, we\u2019d perform and then whatever we did was subject to post\u2011production and the occasional overdub,\u201d says Bowness. \u201cIn this case it was almost exclusively sending files. The interesting thing is that having done both approaches, quite often it\u2019s difficult to tell the difference. I\u2019ve not found it particularly restrictive compositionally, nor have I found it restrictive in terms of what you can then do with the material, because sometimes you can still take it into unusual places based on the contributions that are coming in remotely because something might suggest two or three new ideas.\u201d\nDespite being a self-confessed fan of both Watkins and Anderson, who plays the featured solo on the track Distant Summers, Bowness says he never felt star-struck about asking them to contribute.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re making music, no, I don\u2019t think you ever feel like that, but actually I\u2019ve got say in these cases I didn\u2019t really need to. Certainly, with Ian Anderson, I have to say he did what I wanted and beyond. It was just a wonderful solo and the moment where the fanboy kicks in is when you\u2019ve got the completed piece and you listen to it and you think, \u2018That\u2019s Ian Anderson playing on my piece!\u2019 There\u2019s a real sense of astonishment. The 15-year-old you would be in awe of this moment and, in fact, the present you is in awe of this moment as well. That never goes away.\u201d\nIn terms of maintaining artistic control over his creations, Bowness has the enormous benefit of co-running his own label and outlet, Burning Shed. Once again, however, he\u2019s keen to point out that this happy circumstance isn\u2019t a recipe for self-indulgence, but a further impetus to apply strict quality control.\n\u201cOne of the benefits of Burning Shed is I was always quite bloody-minded and idealistic in terms of what I did, and I think it has made me more bloody-minded and idealistic because I don\u2019t have to put these things out,\u201d he says. \u201cThese things that are going out are very much a labour of love for me, and I\u2019ve always favoured the classic 40- to 45-minute album statement, partly because I think there\u2019s something in that in terms of the concentration of creativity and the concentration of a listener\u2019s attention span that works. Even in the early days of No-Man, in the CD age, when we were signed to labels like One Little Indian and Epic in the early 1990s, I would insist on our albums being short because I felt that although the CD was a fabulous medium in some ways, it did encourage waste; it did encourage indulgence that there\u2019s 70 to 80 minutes of time.\n\u201cThere was a period of incredibly padded-out albums \u2013 and that\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t great, classic double albums because of course there are, and certain music benefits from it. Ambient music, for example, is absolutely liberated when it\u2019s outside of the 40-minute restriction. But for me, with song albums and rock albums, the statement is often more potent if it\u2019s more focused and curtailed.\u201d\nDespite the introspective feel of Lost In The Ghost Light, Bowness says it isn\u2019t intended to be autobiographical \u2013 rather, he was inhabiting a character as he wrote the album.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting about that is it was no less emotional and seemingly no less personal,\u201d he says. \u201cOf course there are elements of my own experience, whether it be people that I\u2019ve met or experiences I\u2019ve witnessed, that are a part of it. There are a couple of lyrics on the album that a couple of older musicians of my acquaintance \u2013 I won\u2019t mention who \u2013 said, \u2018By God, that\u2019s me!\u2019\u201d\nAlthough there\u2019s no formal overarching \u2018trilogy\u2019 theme linking the three records that Bowness has released under his own name since 2014, all of them share the virtue of being conceptual. \u201cI\u2019ve found increasingly as I\u2019ve made albums that I can write songs in isolation, but generally speaking, it only truly feels satisfying when I have a larger theme to work towards, something that excites me. I find that brings out unexpected qualities because you have this end goal in sight and this overall atmosphere and theme.\n\u201cIn a sense, it\u2019s more like working towards the novel than a series of short stories. That is one thing with the three albums: they do have overriding themes. The difference with this is it\u2019s slightly more narrative and specific in that it\u2019s very much about a particular character, time and subject, but again I find sometimes that limitations both in terms of sound and theme can actually produce more creative and intense work. Bizarrely, you find you can better yourself in some way or do something that surprises you through trying to actually fully realise that singular theme.\u201d\nBut will any of this material ever be performed live, perhaps even as a complete concept piece? \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to do musically,\u201d says Bowness, \u201cand also it\u2019s how it would be presented as a stage show. Although I\u2019ve always been a huge fan of bands who have used theatricality, whether it be The Who, Kate Bush, Pink Floyd or David Bowie, in my own work I\u2019ve always been more interested in emotionally presenting something on stage with no distractions. So I don\u2019t know. In a way this would almost suggest something theatrical and certainly something larger scale, so it\u2019s something I\u2019d have to think about seriously if I was considering taking this particular album on tour.\u201d\nFor Bowness, the classic model of record-tour-repeat doesn\u2019t apply, meaning he has a different relationship with his music compared to his progressive predecessors, even as he confronts the musician\u2019s equivalent of post-natal depression.\n\u201cOnce you\u2019ve actually created something and finished it to your satisfaction, there\u2019s always a tremendous slump,\u201d he says. \u201cIn some ways you do everything you can for the album. You put yourself into it for quite a long period of time and then you eject it from your system and try to immerse yourself in something else that excites you as much.\u201d\nDon\u2019t expect Bowness to stumble into a creative slump any time soon though \u2013 he\u2019s already working on new music and, unlike the unhappy protagonist of Lost In The Ghost Light whose peak has long since past, Bowness is just hitting his stride.\nLost In The Ghost Light is out on February 17 on InsideOut. See www.timbowness.co.uk for more.\nA Kink In The Tale\nTim Bowness reveals a rather unlikely inspiration\u2026\n\u201cWhile making the album I was studying various careers, immersing myself in certain people\u2019s work,\u201d says Bowness.\nHe says he was drawn to the \u201cunderrated series of albums from the mid-1970s by Ray Davies of The Kinks, where he went into maximum rock opera phase, continually questioning the nature of what he did in relation to the nature of contemporary reality. There\u2019s one called Soap Opera, which is utterly bonkers, in which he has become The Starmaker who has decided he must live an ordinary life to understand the people and address his own indulgence. So he replaces a nine-to-five civil servant and steps into his life, even sleeping in the house with his wife. It\u2019s a bizarre mishmash of the mundane set against the magic of stardom and it even has a mini-radio play almost between songs.\n\u201cThere are a couple of others called Preservation Act 1 and Preservation Act 2 that were equally insane in their own way. Whether I\u2019d allow myself ever to be this insane I\u2019m not sure, but one thing I quite respect is when artists truly allow their more extreme ideas space. There can be some interesting results.\u201d\nTim Bowness releases Kill The Pain That\u2019s Killing You video\nCritics' Choice 2015 - Tim Bowness\nTim Bowness Reviews Peter Gabriel's Security"}
{"id":"41d1bdad-86f7-4d4a-ba61-b1fcfcf7208c","text":"Humans are natural negotiators. We arrange dozens of tiny little details throughout our day to produce a desired outcome: What time a meeting should start, when you can take time off work, or how many cookies you can take from the cookie jar.\nMachines typically don\u2019t share that affinity, but new research from Facebook\u2019s AI research lab might offer a starting point to change that. The new system learned to negotiate from looking at each side of 5,808 human conversations, setting the groundwork for bots that could schedule meetings or get you the best deal online.\nFacebook researchers used a game to help the bot learn how to haggle over books, hats, and basketballs. Each object had a point value, and they needed to be split between each bot negotiator via text.\nHere\u2019s how the bot works: After it sees what each item is worth, it begins generating a statement listing its demands, one word at a time. For instance, the bot would say, \u201cI\u2019d like all the books,\u201d because the books are worth more points to it than hats or basketballs. Based on how the neural network has seen humans negotiate in the past, it comes up with a combination of words in a particular order that should return the greatest reward.\nThen, after generating its own statement, it generates likely responses from its opponent, and what it would respond to those responses, and then on and on until the end of the conversation. The system does this after every exchange, slowly narrowing down to the optimal outcome. The researchers set the system to not accept getting nothing from the transaction, meaning it can\u2019t walk away from the negotiating table. The bot has to haggle forever.\nThe pursuit of Facebook\u2019s AI isn\u2019t too different than other applications of AI, like the game Go. Each anticipates its opponent\u2019s future actions and works to maximize its winnings. But unlike Google\u2019s Go-playing AlphaGo, Facebook\u2019s algorithm needs to make sense to humans while doing so.\nFrom the human conversations (gathered via Amazon Mechanical Turk), and testing its skills against itself, the AI system didn\u2019t only learn how to state its demands, but negotiation tactics as well\u2014specifically, lying. Instead of outright saying what it wanted, sometimes the AI would feign interest in a worthless object, only to later concede it for something that it really wanted. Facebook isn\u2019t sure whether it learned from the human hagglers or whether it stumbled upon the trick accidentally, but either way when the tactic worked, it was rewarded.\nThe Facebook team says they can also vary how hard the bot negotiates by changing how much it can vary its responses.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Facebook is working on ways to improve how its bot can interact with others\u2014the company is highly invested in building bots that can negotiate on behalf of users and businesses for its Messenger platform, where it envisions the future of customer service. That dream, announced at Facebook\u2019s 2016 F8 developer conference, has not come much closer to becoming reality, as bots today lack the ability to generate useful text or understand many user queries.\nTo accelerate this line of research, Facebook is open-sourcing all of its code and data from the research."}

This sod-turning ceremony - the start of work in the Ipswich\/Brisbane rail link was performed by the Marquis of Normanby the governor of Queensland.\"\nThe spot chosen for the first excavation was a hill through which a cutting would be made.\nA thousand people were at the Six Mile bridge for the ceremony.\nThe official turning took place at 1pm. The wheelbarrow used had been made at the locomotive department of Ipswich.\nIt bore the Marquis of Normanby's coat of arms and crest and a brass plate for the inscription.\nThe spade was made by Messrs Flavelle Bros. and Roberts of Brisbane.\nTulipwood formed the handle and the blade was silver.\nThe inscription of the spade read: \"This spade was used by the Marquis of Normanby, governor of Queensland on January 30, 1873, when his excellency turned the first sod of the Brisbane and Ipswich railway.\"\nWith the advent of the railway line, many buildings were erected at Goodna and there was an influx of navvies and because of this, the work of the police was said to have greatly increased and extra staff had been stationed there.\nDespite the extra workmen, a report in 1874 stated work on the railway was being held up because of the lack of carpenters.\nContractors were willing to pay 10 to 12 shillings a day to men even though they were not qualified.\nThe construction of the line in April 1874 was \"making progress\" and it was hoped to complete it by the end of that year.\nThe bridge over the river at Oxley would not be finished, but the proposal to overcome that was to run trains from Ipswich and Brisbane and to transfer passengers and goods from one to the other by means of a punt.\nOn June 3, 1874, a locomotive engine was taken down Brisbane Rd to be used as the new line extension for ballasting purposes.\nTwenty-four bullocks were needed to drag the engine which weighed 16 tonnes and this was mounted on a large trolley. The first section of this new line from Ipswich to Oxley was completed, and on August 25, 1874, the mayor of Ipswich, Thomas Pryde, and members of the corporation enjoyed a run down this section.\nAccompanying them was the chief engineer, J.T. Smith.\nThe tender and engine took them from a large cutting in the eastern suburbs known as Panton's Cutting and the report stated: \"They went whirling along the new line at a rapid rate.\"\nOn October 5, 1874, the departure of the first public train from Ipswich to Oxley took place.\nAn article in the QT read: \"Its flight was unattended with circumstances of interest. A few fat men and a few thin women, very lavishly husbanded by a number of zealous constables, formed the chief features of observation.\""}

(AP) - The Maryland House of Delegates voted unanimously Monday to strengthen the General Assembly\u2019s policies on sexual harassment to cover lobbyists and create a framework for an independent investigator to handle complaints.\nEarlier this month, a state senator accused a lobbyist of inappropriately touching her in a bar near the statehouse. The lobbyist has denied the allegations. Also this month, three female state lawmakers publicly discussed sexual harassment they\u2019ve experienced while working in the statehouse.\nDel. Ariana Kelly, who sponsored the measure, said discussions about improving the policies began in the fall of 2016, when five female lawmakers first talked with each other about some of their experiences in the state capital.\n\u201cWe realized we had some shared similar experiences, and we thought that breaking the silence would really increase our power, which we have seen in the #MeToo movement,\u201d Kelly, a Democrat, said while explaining her vote.\nThe House voted 138-0 for the bill, which now goes to the Senate.\nThe measure would allow the assembly\u2019s Joint Legislative Committee on Ethics to refer sexual harassment complaints to an independent investigator. It would require referral to an investigator at the request of a complainant. Now, harassment complaints can be filed with the legislature\u2019s human resources department or the presiding officers of the assembly.

While complaints against lawmakers will be addressed by the legislature\u2019s ethics committee, allegations against lobbyists would be handled by the State Ethics Commission, which already has jurisdiction over lobbyists. The commission would create a workgroup to determine potential sanctions lobbyists could face, under the bill. The commission also would add sexual harassment provisions into their training course for registered and prospective lobbyists.\nThe bill incorporates recommendations submitted last month by the legislature\u2019s 60-member women\u2019s caucus.\nIn December, a committee that sets rules for the General Assembly approved making the number of sexual harassment incidents reported against Maryland lawmakers or their staff public in an annual report, which will not name anyone.

{"id":"25bd0efe-b42b-4496-9093-a4421ec742f1","text":"Connecticut venture capital firm funds female entrepreneurs\nGREENWICH, Conn. (AP) \u2014 A young venture capital firm based in Greenwich believes it has a big competitive advantage.\nFounded in 2016 and launched last year, 1843 Capital \u2014 led by Tracy Chadwell and Alison Andrews Reyes \u2014 specializes in technology startups, but it differentiates itself primarily by looking to invest in companies with \"diverse leadership teams that include at least one woman,\" Chadwell said.\nA growing pile of recent studies indicate both women's significance in helping startups succeed and the broad gap between the amount of venture capital dollars given to men versus women. Yet 1843 Capital is one of few firms taking advantage of that disparity, according to Matt McCooe, CEO of Connecticut Innovations, the state-backed venture fund.\n\"There's fairly compelling evidence that women make great CEOs and more diverse teams are more likely to have better outcomes,\" McCooe said. \"I've only heard of maybe three funds that are female-focused, and at the end of the day, those funds are emerging because they get better returns than they would otherwise. They're capitalizing on a market opportunity. Tracy is set up to be successful.\"\nThough 1843 is in its infancy, it's already gaining recognition with founding partner Chadwell accepting the Women's Business Advocate award last week at Moffly Media's annual Women in Business conference. Chadwell can frequently be found speaking at events discussing her work with 1843 and judging startup competitions.\nIt was six years ago that Chadwell began taking advantage of the untapped opportunity to target women-led startups. She launched a precursor to 1843 called Coyote Capital in 2015. Over the next two years, she brought on business parters and changed the name to 1843, which was inspired by Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century mathematician who's been called the first computer programmer. In 1843, Lovelace published a transcript that some have dubbed the first computer program.\nThe numerical name also pushes Chadwell's firm to the top of alphabetized lists, she said.\nChadwell likes to describe her business strategy as achieving a \"double bottom line,\" because of the profitable deals she makes while fostering \"meaningful change.\"\n\"There was a confluence of data validating my decision,\" she said in an interview.\nIn speaking events, Chadwell opens her presentations with studies including those published by PitchBook and First Round Capital that found women-led companies received between 2 and 3 percent of venture capital dollars in 2017 while startups with at least one female founder perform 63 percent better than those with only men.\n\"We're going after female-founded tech companies because there's a market inefficiency,\" said Andrews Reyes, 1843's general partner. \"We have a preference for at least one female founder, because that's a success indicator. Women need to be part of that founding team. We're OK if people want to look at the data and still choose to look in the opposite direction. In the meantime, we'll zig while they zag. We feel like we have a unique capability with our experience and networks.\"\nTranslator To read this article in one of Houston's most-spoken languages, click on the button below. US & World\nChadwell provides the venture capital experience while Andrews Reyes contributes a career spent in engineering as well as building businesses. In 2013, she sold a cybersecurity company she'd grown for seven years called Vigilant to Deloitte before founding Dezignable.com, which she's now handed over to her partner while remaining on its leadership board.\nTogether, the pair considers multiple business pitches every day, mostly in the realms of cybersecurity and what they call \"silvertech,\" or technology for people 50 or older. Andrews Reyes' deep background in cybersecurity and e-commerce give her an edge in evaluating the potential of startups, she said. \"Cybercrime is in the news day in and day out, but to invest in the space, you have to understand the real value of tech companies and what they're putting forth,\" she said. \"There's so many companies out there, so there's a lot of overlap in what they're doing.\"\nEven when they choose against investing in companies, which is most of the time, Chadwell said she tries to help founders by giving advice or pointing them toward another venture capital firm.\nChadwell's enthusiasm and consistent helpfulness played a role in why Wendi Burkhardt, the CEO of one of 1843's investments, wanted to work with her, Burkhardt said. \"Even two years ago, there wasn't a lot of conversation about technology for the aging. I teamed up with Tracy because I was grateful that she understood the landscape and realized what a huge market this is.\"\nIn 2015, Burkhardt co-founded Silvernest, a roommate-matching platform for older people. The Denver-based startup closed a seed fundraising round in 2017 that totaled more than $1 million. Among its investors was 1843 Capital.\n\"Fundraising is a sales process; you're selling,\" Burkhardt said. \"What we need is more Tracys.

The region grows most of Hawaii's taro, a starchy root vegetable used to make poi. The purple, glutinous dish is a traditional part of Hawaiian cuisine, sold at grocery stores and served in homes and restaurants statewide.\nThe state's taro crop was valued at $2.5 million last year, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.\nFarmers say last month's floods smothered their taro patches with mud and silt, which turns their crop watery and spongey. They suspect they'll suffer from dramatically reduced yields for at least a year.\nThe downpour also destroyed seven Kauai homes and badly damaged 65, the state said in a preliminary assessment. It triggered dozens of landslides, including more than 12 on a 2-mile (3-kilometer) stretch of the area's main artery, a highway traveling through coastal communities.\nAgriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has designated the entire island a disaster area, which makes local farmers eligible for federal assistance, including emergency loans.\nBino Fitzgerald, owner of the Hanalei Poi Co., which both farms and buys taro to make poi, expects a shortage of the crop to emerge as soon as this summer. The company sells its poi across Hawaii at stores like Costco, Safeway, Walmart and the local supermarket chain Foodland.\n\"So get your poi fix now,\" he said.\nTaro is perhaps the most important crop in Hawaiian culture. More than part of a meal, it's a member of the family: According to legend, the taro plant and the boy who became the first human were born to the same parents. This gives taro and humans common ancestors.\nHanalei's taro fields are a defining part of the landscape on Kauai's north shore. They evoke a time when taro farming and fishing dominated island life, before sugar plantations diverted stream water and industrialization encouraged migration to cities.\nThe mid-April floods sent brown mud and water cascading into these fields.\nThe muck is packed with nitrogen, so it's as though a big kick of fertilizer walloped taro patches. It's nourishing for the taro's stalk and leaves but makes its corm, or underground bulb, watery and spongey. The Hawaiian term for this is \"loliloli.\"\nThe perfect taro is heavy and dense and mashes into smooth poi. Loliloli taro produces lumpy poi.\nTaro also can be cut into cubes and simmered in stews or sliced thin and fried to make a snack similar to potato chips.\nNewly planted taro won't be ready for harvest for another year to 14 months. Many farmers are still cleaning their fields and won't be able to replant for months, delaying a robust harvest even further.\nThe floods also took out some of the irrigation systems that bring a steady flow of fresh water to Hanalei's taro fields, many of which are part of a national wildlife refuge for endangered native water birds.\n\"Rivers have cut new channels to where they want to flow compared to where they had been before, feeding these old, old irrigation ditches, said Fitzgerald, whose company farms 25 acres and manages another 40 farmed by others. The Hanalei Poi Co. also buys taro from 12 area farmers.\nHanalei Valley frequently floods, but last month's deluge was on another scale. Fitzgerald said his mother's shop has gotten 6 inches (15 centimeters) of water in past storms. This time, it got 5 feet (1.5 meters).\nThe rain may enter the national record books. Preliminary data taken from a rain gauge in Waipa, next to Hanalei, indicates 49.69 inches (126.21 centimeters) of rain fell in the 24 hours through midday on April 15. If a national panel of experts certifies this number, it will smash the existing record for a single 24-hour period of 43 inches (109.22 centimeters) marked in Alvin, Texas, in 1979.\nLyndsey Haraguchi-Nakayama said damage from the flooding was the worst her family has seen \u2014 including her 96-year-old grandfather. It did more harm to their 55-acre farm than Hurricane Iniki, a Category 4 storm that slammed Kauai in 1992.\nNewly planted fields are washed out. Older fields that survived are suffocating under silt.\nMany of the family's tractors are unusable, and all of their trucks are a loss. Her grandparents' home \u2014 a farmhouse occupied by her family for over 100 years \u2014 looks like a drunken driver slammed into its walls, she said.\nShe said she doesn't cry in front of her children because she wants them to know the family will pull through.\n\"You can't stop a huge flood. You can't stop a hurricane from coming. There will always been challenges in life,\" Haraguchi-Nakayama said. \"I just want them to know it's OK to be devastated, but we're going to be as positive as possible.\""}

He settled on baseball.\n\u201cIf there was a closer in track and field, I guess it would be Abigail,\u201d said Schroeder, who described the beginning of Frankian\u2019s season as a bit of a struggle. Still, the Saugus High product found a way Thursday to qualify for NAIA nationals for the fourth straight year.\n\u201cWhen the stakes are high, she knows how to go places mentally that few athletes know how to go to,\u201d Schroeder said.\nFrankian ran the 5K in 17 minutes, 47.64 seconds to hit an NAIA consideration time. Last season, she finished 11th in the event at nationals, just outside All-American status. A year earlier, she ran a program record in the 3,000 steeplechase at NAIA prelims.\nThe other Mustang to qualify for nationals last week at the Bryan Clay Invitational in Azusa was junior Stephen Pacheco. Pacheco hit a PR in the 5,000 (14:56.42), good for an NAIA consideration time.\nHis mark was also the second-fastest by a Golden State Athletic Conference athlete this season. It wasn\u2019t much of a surprise.\nEarly in the year, Schroeder tabbed Pacheco as a leading candidate to qualify on the men\u2019s side, a feat the coach believed would impact the rest of the team.\n\u201cI think he is definitely raising the bar on the men\u2019s side because he\u2019s the first to hit a qualifying mark (this year),\u201d Schroeder said. \u201c\u2026 There isn\u2019t urgency to race big until a teammate does. If guys are performing well, then others will follow suit.\u201d\nFreshman Wes Methum nearly joined Pacheco in qualifying Thursday. Methum fell .65 short of hitting the NAIA B Standard in the 5K. However, he will receive another chance on May 12 at the Oxy Invite in Los Angeles.\nSchroeder also plans to take Hart High product Mikala Fairchild (1,500) and Josh Nunez (steeplechase) to the meet for one last chance to move on.\nThe teams\u2019 previous qualifiers will also run at Oxy. At the forefront is freshman Seanna Nalbandyan, a Canyon High grad.\nEarlier this year, Nalbandyan ran the NAIA\u2019s fourth-fast 400 hurdles time of 2018 (1:01.81), hitting the NAIA A Standard in the process. She has also been part of a groundbreaking relay group.\nPrior to this season, the Mustangs were unable to field sprint relay teams because of numbers. But with the emergence of Nalbandyan, the senior leadership of Tess Thompson and the contributions of Emma Bahr, Emily Hess and Rylee Bishop, the Mustangs continue to set PRs and, as a result, program records at nearly every meet.\nFriday, Thompson, Nalbandyan, Hess and Bahr set a new school record in the 4\u00d7100 relay (51.94).\nBahr, Thompson, Bishop and Nalbandyan crushed the previous record in the 4\u00d7400 on the same day (4:04.81).\n\u201cThese are some of the first times (for Master\u2019s) to do the relays,\u201d Bahr said, \u201cso every time we\u2019re out there and get a PR, it\u2019s a school record. That\u2019s pretty exciting.\u201d\nThompson isn\u2019t sure if the Mustang relays will reach nationals, but with the GSAC Championship looming, she has another goal in mind.\n\u201cI really want to beat Westmont,\u201d she said.\nFor more information on TMU Athletics, visit GoMustangs.com or follow us on Twitter and Instagram: @tmuathletics."}

Bush in 1988), the map usually advantaged the GOP. Republicans currently control 12 seats. Democrats will control six, assuming that Conor Lamb's victory in the 18th district special election stands.\nDemocrats filed suit and the state Supreme Court, where Democrats seized majority control in 2015, sided with them, ordering that the map drawn by Republicans in the state legislature and the governor's office was motivated too much by political concerns and needed to be redrawn.\nAfter the governor -- now a Democrat -- and the still-Republican state legislature deadlocked on a new map, the state Supreme Court drew one that made districts in the state far more compact and contiguous.\nThe new map, which now almost certainly will be the lines under which candidates will run in 2018, also handed Democrats a series of opportunities including at least three seats in southeastern Pennsylvania and several more improved opportunities in places like Allentown and southwestern Pennsylvania.\n(For much more on the map fight, check out my Q&A with the Philly Enquirer's Jonathan Tamari.)\nFor Democrats, the Supreme Court order is good news on top of good news. The national political environment -- as signaled by Lamb's likely victory in a district that Trump won by 20 points in 2016 -- suggests that a large-ish Democratic wave is building in advance of November. Trump's unpopularity, historic trends against the party in power in midterms and the tremendous energy within the Democratic base (again, thanks to Trump) are creating a political climate where Republicans who never thought they would have to worry about a challenge in the general election now have to start worrying.\nOnto all of that lands this ruling in Pennsylvania, which, according to neutral observers is likely to net Democrats three seats minimum this fall. If, say, Democrats could raise that to five seats, then more than 20% of all the seats they need to pick up to retake the majority might come from Pennsylvania alone.\nThen there is the broader import of the Supreme Court declining to hear the redistricting appeal by Pennsylvania Republicans. Pennsylvania is one of a handful of states with ongoing battles over how much partisanship and politics is too much partisanship and politics when it comes to redistricting.\nThe Court is currently considering redistricting cases in Wisconsin and Maryland -- the first was brought by Democrats, the second by Republicans -- that deal with this same topic, but are in federal court as opposed to state court.\nThe broader point here is two-fold: 1) This is a major win for Democrats hoping to retake the House majority this November and 2) If the Court ultimately decides that partisan gerrymandering is unconstitutional, it will have a profound effect on how maps gets drawn -- and who controls the House majority -- in 2021 and beyond."}

He expressed concern that \u201cthe message from the Church of Ireland is changing.\u201d\nArchbishop Neill was responding to a statement last month by Church of Ireland primate Archbishop Richard Clarke and current Archbishop of Dublin Michael Jackson which said \u201cunrestricted access to abortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, or indeed at any stage, is not an ethical position we can accept\u201d.\nThey continued that \u201cwe suggested the possibility of a modification to the present constitutional position\u201d.\nArchbishop Neill said \u201cthe issue of a modified constitutional provision, as suggested in recent statements, is neither the issue before the people of Ireland, nor is it in line with the position that the Church of Ireland has consistently taken\u201d.\nHe continued in a letter to the Church of Ireland Gazette that as \u201cpreviously advocated by the Church of Ireland\u201d the legislature \u201cis the proper context in which to provide a legal framework surrounding abortion\u201d.\nArchbishop Neill, who retired as in 2011, said he was speaking \u201cas one who followed carefully the discussion leading up to the passing of the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution in 1983.

They include, among others, 48 Catholic clergy and lay leaders, 16 Church of Ireland clergy and lay leaders, 15 Methodist, Presbyterian and Baptist leaders, 39 Pentecostal leaders.\nThey have said \u201cwe, as Christians from different denominations, do not want to see abortion on demand being introduced to Ireland. Furthermore, even selective abortions on the basis of gender or disability are forms of discrimination.\u201d They said \u201cwe stand at a crossroads for good or for evil.

It is expected to be attended by up to 6,000 people.\nThey will \u201cimplore the All Powerful to scatter the darkness and confusion in so many minds which are unable to see the humanity of the unborn and their right to life which is the most basic of all rights\u201d, said Bishop Cullinan."}
{"id":"cf16a268-af5e-41a0-8141-d0d1e41d14ac","text":"Photo: Mike Pont\/WireImage\nGroup acts in pop have always been unstable compounds. Even when the pieces fit, the blowup is inevitable. It can happen many ways. The management can be so corrupt that it\u2019s intolerable, for one. Lou Pearlman, the former manager for Backstreet Boys, \u2018N Sync, and virtually every boy band in the \u201990s ended up being sued by most of the groups he managed for gross financial chicanery. Sometimes the group just runs out of steam: Witness the fate of the Spice Girls, who sank out of sight almost as rapidly as they\u2019d risen. And then there\u2019s dissension. Fame magnifies imbalances in talent and, as intramural tensions grow, the allure of a solo career becomes irresistible. Justin Timberlake and Beyonc\u00e9 are the classic examples, but the most recent instance is that of Camila Cabello, who struck out from Fifth Harmony to achieve even greater success on her own.\nMeanwhile, the remainder of Fifth Harmony has taken Cabello\u2019s acrimonious parting rather less well. Today the quartet announced that it would be suspending operations until further notice. Along with One Direction, Fifth Harmony had been the defining pop group of its generation; the end of both in the last three years now raises questions about what could follow them. Pop groups have always been ephemeral by nature, but it\u2019s not impossible that the pop group itself, as a general format, is no longer viable.\nFew types of acts have been more reliant on the music industry than the pop group. With the partial exception of family-based units like the Jonas Brothers or 98 Degrees, its chemistry has always been entirely artificial, and the rise to stardom of any given group is rarely organic. The members\u2019 contribution to their own artistic direction is secondary; all considerations of quality are tied to market appeal. It follows that the relative weakening of the music industry over the past two decades has dampened the prospects for aspiring boy bands and girl groups, plus their managers. Though the industry remains powerful by objective standards, its ability to dictate tastes has fallen off considerably due to the internet. Even if a group is loaded into the catapult, there\u2019s no way to ensure that it hits its mark. It\u2019s telling that Fifth Harmony, One Direction, and the Jonas Brothers came to the industry only after having gained great visibility through television: 5H and 1D were forged on The X-Factor while the Jonases were graduates of the Disney Channel.\nYet as streaming services eat away at the audience for television, particularly among the young, even television seems like less of a sure road to music stardom. It\u2019s telling that a fledgling boy band like Why Don\u2019t We owes most of its recognition to their affiliation with big-league YouTube vlogger Logan Paul rather than publicity arranged by music-business publicists, or that Paul\u2019s brother and fellow YouTube celebrity, Jake Paul, could land his posse Team 10 on the Billboard charts with a song named after Jake\u2019s catchphrase, \u201cIt\u2019s Everyday Bro.\u201d To say that Team 10 qualify as a musical act would be generous, but they\u2019re the closest thing to a future model for the pop group that we have at this point, which is a nice way of saying that there may be no future at all.\nAnd then there\u2019s the state of pop itself, which seems more and more like a saccharine sub-variant of rap than the main attraction for the masses. Pop groups thrive on the spotlight and the spotlight only, but as pop is progressively eclipsed by hip-hop on streaming, it\u2019s evident that however well individual solo acts adjust to the new environment, any new pop group will have a hard time gaining traction. Who needs the next Jonas Brothers when the Migos already exist? Why invest time and money to invent five different characters for a girl group when Cardi B is realer than anyone the industry can manufacture?\nOf course, the prospects for the pop group are hardly dire everywhere in the world. For at least a decade, the liveliest girl groups and boy bands have come out of South Korea, where a rising economy and a relative absence of competition has made fresh-faced acts like BTS, BIGBANG, Wonder Girls, and 2NE1 not only major stars in their own country but superstars within much of East Asia. Backed by ferocious fan hives with access to the world\u2019s fastest internet, K-pop groups sit at the peak of the Korean music industry. And though the music industry abroad is no less exploitative and groups are no less prone to dissolution, it\u2019s still a given in Seoul that when one group goes down, another one, just as big if not bigger, will soon replace it. As far as a successor to Fifth Harmony goes, though, we\u2019ll believe it only when we see it."}

His name, face, and voice were then \u2013 and still are now \u2013 recognised in an instant. But though he is the \u201cking of rock-and-roll\u201d, Elvis defies easy generalisation.\nBorn in a two-room shotgun shack in 1935, Elvis was a shy child, close to his parents, especially his mother. He was first introduced to performing for an audience through a local singing contest at the age of ten, and was influenced by gospel and singing in the choir at the family\u2019s evangelical church.\nThe Presleys moved to Memphis, Tennessee, in 1948. As a teenager, Elvis hung out on the iconic Beale Street, exploring the famed music scene and listening to white and black, urban and rural styles and sounds, especially rhythm-and-blues. This was also where he started experimenting with fashion and changing his appearance, not least his hair which he styled with Vaseline into a quiff.\nDuring the summer of 1954, Elvis recorded a version of the old blues number That\u2019s All Right (Mama) in downtown Memphis. The recording was a sensation, and was played nonstop on local radio stations. From there, Elvis and his band evolved a distinctive rock-and-roll \u2013 or \u201crockabilly\u201d \u2013 sound, blending different strains of music with an energetic vocal style, new rhythms and electric guitars.\nIn 1955, as his music career began to take off, Elvis signed with Nashville\u2019s RCA record label, a deal arranged by music promoter Colonel Tom Parker, who later became the singer\u2019s long-time manager. Elvis\u2019s first RCA single, Heartbreak Hotel, released in 1956, topped the music charts in the US.\nAs his music rose through the tracks, Elvis appeared on a number of US network television variety shows, most notably the Ed Sullivan Show, accelerating his national profile and fame. Soon after he also launched a movie career with Love Me Tender, which was a success at the box office if not with critics.\nAll shook up\nWith rose tinted glasses, it may seem that Elvis was beloved by all. But the singer was often the subject of controversy, provoking strong opinions among the public and in the press. His on-screen swagger and performance style, consisting of overstated gyrations and other body movements stressing the beat, thrilled his teenage audiences, shaping their fads and fashions.\nElvis was labelled a \u201csexhibitionist\u201d, and his suggestive manner was criticised by churches that claimed his moves corrupted the minds of young Americans. Outraged parents meanwhile equated rock-and-roll with disobedience and delinquency. Even Frank Sinatra waded into the debate, claiming the new music genre \u201cmanages to be the martial music of every sideburned delinquent on the face of the earth\u201d.\nRock-and-roll\u2019s biracial origins, a fusion of white country and black rhythm-and-blues, and Elvis\u2019s prominent role in developing the genre, also led to persistent accusations of cultural appropriation. That these debates played out against a backdrop of racial discrimination, segregation in the south and the national movement for civil rights only fuelled resentment towards Elvis.\nAlways on my mind\nIn 1958, Elvis was drafted for military service, a major event for fans and media. After basic training, he joined the 3rd Armoured Division and was stationed in Germany for two years. Yet the hits continued apace, including 1960\u2019s best-selling ballads, It\u2019s Now or Never and Are You Lonesome Tonight?.\nDuring the 1960s, Elvis also starred in several prescribed Hollywood movies, usually musical comedies that were accompanied by a soundtrack album. However, by mid-decade Elvis\u2019s career was in decline, his chart success waning. Several years on from his last live stage performance, he launched a comeback with a celebrated television special, \u201cElvis\u201d, in 1968, which was followed by \u201cAloha from Hawaii\u201d in 1973.\nHis career relaunched, Elvis\u2019s 1970s concerts in Las Vegas, where he had married Priscilla Beaulieu in 1967, were popular and profitable; the singer performing hits such as The Wonder of You, Burning Love, and \u201cAn American Trilogy in flared rhinestone jumpsuits.\nRCA Records\/PA Archive\/PA Images\nSadly, after years of prescription drug misuse and in failing health, Elvis passed away on August 16, 1977, after suffering a sudden heart attack in his Graceland home. Thousands of mourners gathered outside his Memphis estate in private tribute to view Elvis\u2019s body which lay in an open casket. Commenting on Presley\u2019s legacy, the US president, Jimmy Carter, said: \"His music and his personality \u2026 permanently changed the face of American popular culture.\u201d\nFrom a shy young boy to global superstar, the icon of the 20th century that was Elvis Presley is still as enigmatic today as when he was alive. One of the most celebrated and influential popular musicians of all time, his gift and talent, flaws and failings are as enchanting now as they were when he first snarled his lips."}

Vaughan has never thrown a regular season pass in the league, despite entering the NFL as an undrafted free agent in 2014.\nLewis has had a longer career and has started five games for the Buffalo Bills in 2013. Since then, Lewis has primarily bounced around the league as a backup and camp arm. Much like Vaughan, Lewis entered the NFL as an undrafted free agent hailing from Duke in 2010.\nVaughan had struggled at times during training camp and posted only one pass in the Ravens\u2019 lone preseason game. Though it was a completion for 10 yards, it likely wasn\u2019t enough to shield his job from the recently signed Josh Woodrum, who has arguably been the most impressive arm at a very lackluster camp thus far.\nThe move to change backup quarterbacks could once again embroil fans into the Colin Kaepernick discussion. While Kaepernick is typically the type of player a team would bring in for a main backup role or starting one, previous changes to the roster have elicited a pretty intense discussion amongst fans who either think Kaepernick deserves a chance and those that point to his previous protests as a reason to overlook him.\nWith franchise quarterback Joe Flacco due back at practice at some point in near future, it\u2019s unlikely that Baltimore will keep either Woodrum or Lewis on the active roster for the regular season. The Ravens have typically only gone into the season with two quarterbacks and they seem fairly dedicated to Ryan Mallett as the primary backup."}

In Ethiopia, the population could almost double by 2050 while migration will rise due to diminishing harvests.\nBy that year in Bangladesh, climate migrants could be the single-largest group among all internally displaced persons.\nAnd in Mexico, people will increasingly gravitate towards urban areas from regions vulnerable to climate change.\nAt a recent conference of the International Organisation for Migration, France's Minister for Ecology and Solidary Transition Nicolas Hulot said the climate was already displacing twice as many people as conflicts were, and that it might already be the main cause of migration.\nGilbert Houngbo, president of the UN's International Fund for Agricultural Development, said fast-growing rural populations in Sub-Saharan Africa that cannot grow enough food to feed themselves were particularly vulnerable.\nThe region's inhabitants currently number 645 million but will add another 1.4 billion by 2055, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation.\nNevertheless climate-linked migration need not descend into humanitarian crisis, according to the World Bank.\nResearchers believe the number could be reduced by 80 per cent if countries reduce emissions, account for migration in development planning and make investments in studying the process of internal climate migration.\nThey developed three scenarios: a worst case, involving high greenhouse gas emissions, a scenario in which better environmental policies are enacted and one with greater development.\n\"Without the right planning and support, people migrating from rural areas into cities could be facing new and even more dangerous risks,\" Kanta Kumari Rigaud, a chief author of the report, said in a statement."}
{"id":"8d70ee58-9d10-42cf-b5eb-421d8bd3636d","text":"That's undeniable. What's not so clear is why this sport, which was supposed to be America's next big thing, has stalled in recent years. Oh sure, plenty of explanations have been floated, from tedious races and boring drivers to big-name stars retiring and hard-core fans resenting efforts to detach the sport from its Southern roots. Well, there is an underlying issue that will likely have a more profound impact on its future. Many Americans \u2014 young Americans, especially \u2014 just don't dig cars like their parents and grandparents. 'I know that NASCAR is thinking about it and worried, just as the car companies are worried,' said Cotten Seiler, a professor of American studies at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania and author of the book 'Republic of Drivers: A Cultural History of Automobility in America.' Indeed, if you make your living off the car business, there are plenty of reasons to be concerned. A study released last year by the Transportation Research Institute at the University of Michigan showed a significant decrease in the share of young Americans with a driver's license \u2014 especially among 16-year-olds, a group that plunged 47 percentage points from 1983 to 2014. 'One of the draws of a sport like NASCAR has always been living vicariously through the drivers,' Seiler said. 'Well, if you don't drive yourself, it's hard to see how that would be attractive to you.' On a personal level, I can vouch for this profound cultural shift. When our son turned 16, he was surprisingly in no rush to get a driver's license. As I dropped him off at high school each morning, the line of child-toting parents created a daily bottleneck in front of the school, while the students' parking lot was largely empty. Our son is 18 now. A college freshman. He still doesn't have a driver's license. 'It's really kind of a curious development,' said John Heitmann, author of 'The Automobile and American Life' and a history professor at the University of Dayton. 'Of course, it's driving the auto industry crazy right now. They realize that so many young people are really not interested in their product anymore. That's why they're jazzing them up all with all these electronic goodies, thinking that's what will lure them back into the car.' Several factors have conspired to make the automobile much less of a must-have product for young people. Most notably, a generation that has grown up on computers and smartphones views the car as nothing more than a major crimp on their lifestyle. When they're behind the wheel, they can't be on all their devices (at least not legally and safely). This is perhaps the biggest challenge facing the car industry and, by extension, NASCAR. 'We have to get it right,' said Dave Pericak, the global director of Ford's racing division. 'If we get it right, the future will be bright. If we get it wrong, it's not going to be good.' The manufacturers are devoting plenty of resources toward making the automobile more attractive to future generations, knowing it has become a bit of an anachronism in our highly connected world, largely unnecessary when you can hook up with friends via the internet or get around heavily congested urban areas cheaply and with less aggravation using ride-share services such as Uber and Lyft. 'We've got to figure out how to better incorporate the technology and things that are important to them into our vehicles, so the vehicle will be an extension of them,' said Pericak, who pointed to voice controls and autonomous cars as two of the most intriguing developments. 'Just like iPads and iPhones are an extension of who they are, an extension of their freedom. Our freedom was getting in a car and blasting down the road. It's just totally different now.' Adding to the challenge: Environmental concerns that are particularly relevant to young people, many of whom view racing as an energy-guzzling pursuit that, at least symbolically, contributes to climate change. Pericak said it's not unfathomable to envision a time when stock cars are powered by electricity, not fossil fuels. 'It was a shocker to me,' he said. 'For the younger generation, the environment absolutely matters. The more we can look at hybrid technology and show responsibility as automakers, it will resonate with the younger generation. They will appreciate that.' In the meantime, NASCAR is taking numerous steps toward connecting with potential fans of the future. Starting this year, free tickets were offered to those 12 and under for Xfinity and truck series races. More than 10,000 schools are using racing-related materials to study aerodynamics and NASCAR's 'Three D's of Speed' \u2014 drag, downforce and drafting. There are summer programs designed to bring kids closer to the sport, and an increased emphasis on connecting with young fans through social media platforms. Even that most traditional method of reaching the fan base \u2014 the paid sponsorship \u2014 often has a youth-oriented theme. For instance, two September races at Chicagoland Speedway were sponsored by Nickelodeon and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies. 'There are a lot of kids that are growing up in a social media environment, whereas my generation didn't,' said Dale Earnhardt Jr., long the sport's most popular driver but retiring at the end of the year. 'They are on these different platforms and we need to go there with people they relate to, to connect to them in those areas.' Pericak isn't worried that racing will go the way of the dinosaur. He still sees a fascination with speed and high-tech machines that spans the generations. He knows we are still a nation that relies almost totally on the automobile to get around. But the current trends do not bode well for NASCAR, even more so than other forms of racing. The sports has always relied on the association they have with actual street machines, which is why they still pass off today's sleek racers as the Ford Fusion, Chevrolet SS and Toyota Camry. It's a selling technique that ties into America's long love affair with the automobile, a way to build brand loyalty and keep cars moving off the lots. There was a time when cars such as the General Lee ('Dukes of Hazzard') and KITT ('Knight Rider') were the stars. No longer. And if fewer young people are driving, and even when they finally do it's more out of necessity than any affection for being at the wheel, it could strike at the very core of NASCAR. It already is. ___ Paul Newberry is a sports columnist for The Associated Press. Write to him at pnewberry@ap.org or at www.twitter.com\/pnewberry1963 .

When a man discovers he has low testosterone, his first reaction is often to want a prescription for treating this condition.\nThe symptoms of low testosterone are enough to make any man take his chances on any possible side effects TRT may have. The symptoms of low testosterone include:\nIncrease in belly fat\nWeight gain\nLow to no sex drive\nFatigue\nRisk of depression\nIrritability\nMood swings\nLow energy\nReduced bone density\nReduced muscle mass\nIncreased risk of diabetes\nGynecomastia or breast enlargement\nDecrease in motivation or self-confidence\nBefore a man is prescribed testosterone, he needs to have his testosterone levels checked by his doctor to have a confirmed diagnosis. Even though a man may believe the perfect solution is to get started on TRT, it\u2019s not always the best thing to try first. Testosterone replacement therapy itself needs to be monitored as it can also have side effects, including:\nOily skin\nSleep apnea\nGynecomastia or breast enlargement\nMay increase risk of blood clot forming in a deep vein (deep vein thrombosis)\nPossible increased risk of heart disease\nBefore being prescribed TRT, a man should look into natural ways to increase testosterone. Here are a few natural approaches that could bring about significant benefits:\nIf necessary, lose weight\u2014particularly belly fat. Being obese or overweight plays a huge role in low testosterone. The more extra weight a man gains, the lower his testosterone levels. The fat that accumulates in the abdomen\u2014belly fat\u2014can secrete hormones related to heart disease and low testosterone. Excess body fat causes an enzyme called aromatase to convert testosterone into estrogen in the stomach, which can result in enlargement of a man\u2019s breasts, also known as gynecomastia.\nReduce intake of unhealthy carbohydrates that can contribute to weight gain. Examples of simple carbs include white bread, pizza, pasta, cookies and cake. Also eliminate added sugar and sugary beverages. The American Heart Association recommends that a man should consume no more than 36 grams or nine teaspoons of sugar a day.\nBecome more physically active. It\u2019s recommended to get in at least 150 minutes a week of moderate to vigorous exercise such as jogging, brisk walking, playing tennis or taking the stairs\u2014anything that gets you up and moving.\nLimit alcohol. If a man is going to use alcohol, he needs to drink in moderation, which is defined as no more than two drinks per day\u2014equivalent to a 12-ounce beer, five ounces of wine or 1.5 ounces of hard liquor.\nReduce stress. Stress is inevitable, but it\u2019s important to handle it properly. Have a plan on how to handle stress because the stress hormone cortisol suppresses the body\u2019s ability to produce testosterone.\nGet enough sleep. Testosterone is produced during the deeper phases or sleep or REM sleep. Therefore, men who are sleep-deprived are also testosterone-deprived as well. Most adults require between 6-8 hours of sleep each night.\nAvoid opioids. One known side effect of this medication is disruption of normal hormone functioning including lowering testosterone production.\nIncrease intake of zinc, vitamin D and healthy fats. Zinc is very important for testosterone production. Include foods rich in this mineral such as meats, nuts and fish. Vitamin D can naturally help keep testosterone levels where they should be. The sun is our main natural source of the vitamin, but foods sources that contain it include salmon, egg yolks, milk and tuna. A vitamin D supplement of 1,000-2,000 International Units (IU) a day is also advisable. Healthy fats are necessary for making testosterone. These all-important fats are found in foods such as olive oil, nuts, seeds, grass-fed beef and avocados.\nDr. Samadi is a board-certified urologic oncologist trained in open and traditional and laparoscopic surgery and is an expert in robotic prostate surgery.

Against Brazil, it will not be about ball possession, but what you do with it. That's what this World Cup is all about,\" the Spaniard told Belgian media on Wednesday.\n\"We know what we are capable of but Brazil are the favorites, putting us into a different role,\" he added. \"But it's a dream match for our players, they were born to play in a match like this. Naturally we want to win but we are not expected to and that is an important difference.\"\nMartinez saw his side rally from the brink of elimination to snatch a last-gasp 3-2 win over Japan in the Round of 16 on Monday, booking a meeting with the five-time World Cup winners.\nAt times in Rostov-on-Don, Belgium looked hamstrung by Japan's pressing tactics and needed more than an hour to unshackle themselves and set about a dramatic come-from-behind victory after falling 2-0 down.\nFor Friday's match, the tactics might be simpler.\n\"Against a team like Brazil, you must attack and defend with 11 players. We are not talking about a system but understanding what we must do when we have possession,\" the coach added. \"I don't think it will be a game with many secrets. We have to defend as well as we can and then cause them pain when we have the ball. It can be that simple and this squad is ready for that.\"\nMartinez now faces a tricky decision concerning his line-up with Nacer Chadli and Marouane Fellaini pressing for starts after coming off the bench against Japan to turn the game around in the last half an hour.\n\"As a coach, I have a lot of options with this team but I know in my head what I want to do. We will need power,\" he said in a hint that the physical presence of Fellaini might be deployed from the beginning.\n\"If we show the same mentality as we did on Monday, we have a big chance.\"\nBelgium play in a second successive World Cup quarterfinal, looking to reach the semifinals for the second time after they advanced to the last four in Mexico 32 years ago.\n\"We have worked hard over two years for this and we are as ready as we ever can be. We've won all our games, everyone has played and we've scored 12 times. The game against Japan gave us a big boost,\" he said.\n\"There is something special about this squad. If we play well, we can create a lot of chances. But there is no margin for error. If we give Brazil a chance, they will take it. I think it will be the match of the tournament.\"\nThe winner of the tie will face either France or Uruguay in St Petersburg on July 10.\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2018."}

The parking lot was dotted with blue and red sweaters. And people were pumped up.\n\"On the walk in, a bunch of fans were out there hooting and hollering,\" said Leafs winger Connor Brown. \"We understand how big of a deal a game like this is halfway through the season \u2013 really it was just for two points (in the standings) \u2013 but how much it means to the city.\"\nAnd the overwhelming feeling after a thrilling, 5-4 overtime victory for Toronto over Detroit?\nBelief.\nIt\u2019s back, and it\u2019s been missing for some time.\nIt was Auston Matthews who froze the clock at 3:40 after eluding defenceman Danny Dekeyser and somehow backhanding the puck home while skating away from the net. The 19-year-old hit 20 goals in his 36th NHL game \u2013 something no one rookie has accomplished since Alex Ovechkin in 2005.\n\"To get a big goal like that, you don\u2019t want to call it a storybook \u2026 but you may as well, right?\" said Leafs defenceman Morgan Rielly.\nHow\u2019s this for a New Year\u2019s Day present? Matthews earned his first rookie bonus of $212,500 with the 20th goal and is well on the way to maxing out on the full $2.85-million he can claim on his entry-level deal.\nWith parents Brian and Ema among the 40,148 in attendance and a national TV audience in two countries, it was the biggest stage he\u2019d ever been on. It was also the first time the Scottsdale, Ariz., native had played a game outdoors.\n\"One of the best moments in hockey I\u2019ve ever experienced for myself,\" said Matthews. \"It\u2019s pretty special. All 23 guys out there, we played a real solid game tonight \u2026 and when it\u2019s a little bigger setting, a lot more fans, kind of that national stage, for us to come out and get that win was a pretty exciting game.\n\"I think people were on the edge of their seats there in the third period and overtime, so it was just really fun to experience this whole thing.\"\nIt more than made up for a dull opening 40 minutes. At one point it looked like Red Wings rookie goalie Jared Coreau, making just his fourth NHL appearance, was going to steal the show.\nOut in the winter cold, there was some frustration brewing in the stands \u2013 at least until Leo Komarov set off a massive roar by tying it up a little more than a minute into the third period.\nThe enthusiasm went right to the Leafs\u2019 legs and the goals started raining down. Mitch Marner, then Brown, then Matthews and it was 4-1. All three are rookies \u2013 Brown and Marner having grown up nearby \u2013 and they\u2019re looking more comfortable by the day in the NHL.\nThe Red Wings were stunned. Coach Jeff Blashill called a timeout and addressed his players.\n\"Well, I just said we had played good for a lot of the game, and they just scored three goals in a real quick span, why can't we?\" he said. \"Let\u2019s just go back and get to playing.\"\nIt proved to be prescient.\nThe Red Wings started taking some chances and applying pressure. After narrowing the score to 4-3, they hemmed the Matthews line in the defensive zone for a full minute before Anthony Mantha scored with just over a second left.\nAsked later about it being a statement-type of game, Brown quipped: \"We almost sent the wrong kind of message.\"\nWhat head coach Mike Babcock liked most was that they kept their nerve.\n\"At playoff time in the National Hockey League you\u2019re either up one or down one,\" said Babcock. \"It\u2019s the same every night. You\u2019ve got to love the duress. You\u2019ve got to love the grind. You\u2019ve got to love digging in and knowing you\u2019re going to get it done, so that was a good opportunity for our team because we haven\u2019t had those kind of opportunities.\"\nIt was the fifth straight win for the Leafs and put them within three points of Boston for third place in the Atlantic Division. It\u2019s not by accident that Babcock referenced the playoffs.\nOn a stage like this one we got a clearer sense of a group that seems to be growing up together.\nThe organization made a point of bringing members of the alumni into the dressing room here to mix with the current team. Darcy Tucker mentioned that he knew the Leafs had something good going on when he saw how happy Matthews was after Nazem Kadri\u2019s overtime winner in Tampa earlier this week.\n\"This is different than anything that I\u2019ve gone through,\" said Rielly. \"I think we have a great feeling going on in this room, we have lots of confidence with the people that we have here. We\u2019re a closer group than I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\"That might have to do with the age, that might have to do with guys being together for a bit longer. It\u2019s a great feeling.\"\nThe Leafs had to walk across the concourse to get to their dressing room and hundreds of fans formed a sound tunnel that was deafening. Talk about a unique experience.\nIt was yet one more endorsement for the special feelings that inevitably accompany the NHL\u2019s outdoor experience.\nWhile the question is often asked about whether the bloom is off the rose with these events, the joy found around both teams over the weekend provided a pretty resounding \"No.\" Babcock has been through three of these and says everyone loves being part of it.\n\"They\u2019re one of the greatest gifts you can give your family,\" said Babcock.\nIt\u2019s a pretty nice present for your fans as well."}

Things turned for the worse, and Sam struggled to sleep.\nHe started buying sleeping pills online, but had overdosed in July last year after taking too many tablets.\nHis family took him to see his GP \u2013 the court heard he did not like going to the doctors \u2013 and he was referred to A&E at Southmead Hospital. After he was seen by mental health services, they referred him again to an ADHD specialist to get a proper diagnosis.\nBut his GP, Dr Luke Parker from Close Farm Surgery, told the court the waiting list was \u201cmonths-long\u201d.\nSam\u2019s family was starting to get worried. He had started using cannabis and cocaine to deal with his mental health issues, and he was struggling to sleep, waking up in the middle of the night and turning lights on in the house.\nHis family wanted to get him sectioned under the Mental Health Act, which mean he would be taken into custody by police, but they would not be able to do so because he did not have a diagnosis.\nDuring that time, his anxiety got worse as he struggled to sleep.\nOn September 18 last year, the court heard Sam had spent the day before on drugs and alcohol. He went to his partner\u2019s house in Knowle, where they had an argument.\nSam threatened to set himself on fire and when he did so he ran out of the house into the street.\nHis neighbour told the police in a statement he had seen Sam in flames and took a blanket out to the street and hugged him to try and put out the flames.\nPart of the home was burned while Sophie took her young daughter and pet dog to the car to protect them.\nThe court heard paramedics had to wait for the all-clear by police before they could treat Sam.

Officials at both companies attributed the surge to the heightened tension.\nNorth Korea said on Thursday its army would complete plans in mid-August to fire four intermediate-range missiles over Japan to land near the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam.\nU.S. President Donald Trump said North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was not going to get away with his \"horrific\" comments and disrespecting America.\n\"Koreans used to be numb to North Korea\u2019s threats, however, it seems different this time, and people are taking it seriously,\" said Song Jong-gil, an official of Korea Gold Exchange 3M, where sales of mini gold bars have surged five-fold since Aug. 9.\nAfter Trump's \"fire and fury\" threat heightened tension, average daily sales volume has been 250 bars, ranging in weight between 10 grams (0.35 oz) and 100 grams (3.5 oz), versus about 50 earlier, Song said, adding the trend would continue through August.\nA sign of shelter is seen at an entrance of a subway station in Seoul, South Korea, August 11, 2017.

South Koreans, who are still technically at war with their combative neighbours, are no exception.\nExperts say if North Korea did launch intermediate-range missiles toward Guam, all its other missiles and artillery would be ready for action. Hundreds of thousands of troops and huge arsenals are arrayed on both sides of the tense demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.\nAt least 1,000 of the North's artillery pieces are capable of reaching densely populated Seoul and its metropolitan area, home to some 25 million people.\nBIGGER DRILLS\nSlideshow (3 Images)\nSeoul is expanding its participation in a nationwide civil defence drill, set to take place on Aug. 23, Shim Kang-cheon, a local Seoul government official, told Reuters.\nThe five-minute drill begins with a siren on radio, and cars are stopped at designated spots. Pedestrians are escorted off the streets and taken to safe spots like subway stations.\nAll of Seoul's 25 districts will participate in the drill this year, Shim said, compared to just five last year.\nIn a recent message, Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon said, \"Since North Korea is very close to crossing the red line, Seoul needs to ramp up all defence measures against North Korea\u2019s potential threat,\" said another Seoul city official who asked not to be identified by name.\nThe drill coincides with the four-day \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\" military manoeuvres on August 21-24, which are held yearly and include joint exercises by the U.S. and South Korean armed forces, as well as drills for emergencies.\nBut many officials say there is a long way to go to raise public awareness about civil defence. At two subway stations visited by Reuters on Friday, many people didn't know the locations were among Seoul's more than 3,200 designated bomb shelters.\nFew bomb shelters have long-term supplies of food, water, medical kits or gas masks, because the mostly private owners of the shelters get no public funding.\n\"Since the subway stations in South Korea have enough depth and strength, we will be able to survive attacks. It is just a shame that such infrastructure is not advertised well to the public and that we are short of emergency supplies,\" said Yang Uk, senior fellow at Korea Defense and Security Forum, a research institute in Seoul."}
{"id":"9a79f041-d049-4dc8-9f63-73958484658c","text":"Canadiens owner Geoff Molson confirmed last week that Marc Bergevin will be back next season, meaning the GM will be spending part of his time this off-season trying to convince free agents to come to Montreal.\nJeff Petry might be able to help him with that.\nBergevin acquired Petry from the Edmonton Oilers at the NHL trade deadline on March 2, 2015 in exchange for a second-round pick (Jonas Siegenthaler) and a fourth-round pick (Caleb Jones) at the 2015 NHL Draft. Petry could have become an unrestricted free agent after that season, but instead decided to stay in Montreal, signing a six-year, US$33-million contract.\nSince then, the 30-year-old defenceman has settled in nicely on the South Shore of Montreal near the team\u2019s Brossard practice facility with his wife, Julie, their two young boys \u2014 Boyd, who is 2, and Barrett, 10 months \u2014 and a 4-year-old chocolate Labrador dog named Nellie.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a great place to live,\u201d Petry said after the Canadiens\u2019 morning skate Monday in Brossard. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of different areas, depending on the player\u2019s situation. Obviously, the single guys like the downtown area with lots of restaurants and stuff. Family guys, the area that I\u2019m in there\u2019s a good size yard, quiet area and I\u2019ve enjoyed it.\u201d\nPetry recently took Canadiens fans on a tour through his family\u2019s house with a video on the team\u2019s website. Not surprisingly, it\u2019s a beautiful home and Petry noted you can get a pretty good bang for the buck when it comes to housing on the South Shore. Julie admitted the house isn\u2019t always as clean as it was when the film crew showed up, saying Boyd likes to use the couch cushions to build forts and there are usually \u201c1.5 million\u201d toys everywhere \u2014 something most mothers with two young boys can relate to.\nPetry and his wife met when they were both at Michigan State University, where he played hockey for the Spartans and Julie was on the field-hockey team. Petry grew up near Detroit, where his father, Dan, was a pitcher for the Tigers, while Julie is from Texas. But they are both now comfortable living on the South Shore.\n\u201cJulie enjoys it,\u201d Petry said. \u201cShe likes the group of wives (from the team). There was an adjustment with a new house and finding the grocery story and stuff like that, but she does enjoy it.\u201d\nOn the tour of his house, Petry displays his watch collection and his wine cellar, which he calls \u201cprobably my favourite room in the house.\u201d The basement is part man cave and part memorabilia room, including an autographed batting helmet from former Expos outfielder Vladimir Guerrero, who was one of Petry\u2019s favourite ball players when he was growing up.\nPetry played baseball as a first-baseman until he was 17 and then decided to focus on hockey.\n\u201cEvery kid wants to play professional sports, but it never really crossed my mind in high school to play in the NHL,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, it was take it as far as I can go. My first step was to get a college education. When it got to that point when I had to decide, I never really thought about baseball as becoming a professional.\u201d\nThe Oilers selected Petry in the second round (45th overall) at the 2006 NHL Draft after his first season with the USHL\u2019s Des Moines Buccaneers. He played one more season with the Buccaneers before spending three years at Michigan State and then turning pro.\nThis has been a difficult season for the Canadiens, who will miss the playoffs for the second time in three years. Petry has had to fill the role as the team\u2019s No. 1 defenceman since Shea Weber went down with a season-ending foot injury in mid-December. Petry is averaging 23:37 of ice time per game with 10-25-35 totals and a minus-29 heading into Monday night\u2019s game against the Florida Panthers. Petry has already posted career highs in goals and points and his plus\/minus is reflective of playing a ton of minutes on a bad team.\n\u201cObviously, we\u2019ve had a lot of injuries, a lot of bodies coming though,\u201d Petry said. \u201cWebs going down was a big loss for our team and not only myself, but I think everybody had to kind of step up. So it\u2019s good to get that kind of experience.\u201d\nAs for the media scrutiny that comes with playing in Montreal \u2014 something that might scare some free agents away \u2014 Petry said: \u201cFor my situation, I had dealt with a crazy hockey market in Edmonton and the media there, so coming here it wasn\u2019t much different. But if you\u2019re playing well, the media\u2019s great and it\u2019s a great place to be and, obviously, everybody wants that.\u201d\nscowan@postmedia.com\ntwitter.com\/StuCowan1"}

The company had already been working with Target on a same-day delivery pilot program in New York\u2019s Tribeca neighborhood, prior to this deal. That pilot will expand this fall to more New York area stores before a broader rollout to other large metros starting next year.\nThe retailer had already dipped its toe in the water of on-demand, local delivery. It has tested same-day delivery in 2014, and later in partnership with Instacart. And this May it announced its plans for Target Restock, a next-day delivery service focused on \u201ceveryday essentials,\u201d like household items, personal care products and other dry goods \u2013 similar to those you can order through Amazon Prime Pantry.\nThe Restock service had been in testing with staff at Target\u2019s headquarters before expanding to a consumer-facing pilot with customers in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, where Target is based.\nAround the same time, Target also announced a small test of same-day delivery in New York. The pilot allowed guests shopping the Tribeca location to have their in-store purchases delivered anywhere in Manhattan, and to parts of Brooklyn or Queens. This eliminated the need for customers to haul their heavier purchases home themselves, or on public transit.\nGrand Junction\u2019s technology was used in this NY area test, Target says.\nThe company offers a software platform that\u2019s used by retailers, distributors and third-party logistics providers to manage local deliveries through a network of more than 700 carriers. The software helps to determine the most efficient, fastest route for a local delivery, while also tracking deliveries and giving the retailer an overview of carrier performance.\nBy bringing this technology in-house, Target says it will be able to offer same-day delivery in more areas, as well as assembly and installation services. Potentially, this could be used to speed up Target Restock from a next-day to a same-day delivery service, as well.\nHowever, the deal is about more than just same-day, Target says. That includes all last-mile logistics needs, from regular online orders to same-day or next-day from stores.\nWith the acquisition, Target gains immediate access to Grand Junction\u2019s technology and carrier network, which will allow it to more quickly move into same-day delivery. Grand Junction\u2019s 13 employees will become a part of Target\u2019s technology team in San Francisco, where they\u2019ll best tasked with expanding the New York area pilot this year, ahead of a wider same-day delivery service rollout next year.\n\u201cGrand Junction\u2019s technology and algorithms will help Target deliver to guests faster and more efficiently,\u201d said Arthur Valdez, executive vice president, chief supply chain and logistics officer, Target, in statement. \u201cThis acquisition is part of Target\u2019s ongoing efforts to strengthen Target\u2019s supply chain to provide greater speed, reliability and convenience for guests.\u201d\nAbove: Target\u2019s next-day delivery service, Restock\nSame-day delivery is an area where there\u2019s an increasing amount of competition. Amazon today offers Prime Now in over 30 U.S. markets, promising 2-hour delivery of thousands of items. A good handful of same-day grocery delivery services are also gaining steam, including Instacart, Shipt, Peapod and others. There\u2019s also Postmates for restaurant and general product delivery. And Uber is figuring out how to leverage its technology for than just moving more than people.\nMeanwhile, Walmart has doubled down on a same-day pickup service for groceries, and even incentivized customers with discounts when online customers chose to ship items to the store for pickup instead of delivery. Walmart has also taken on Amazon with a free 2-day shipping service and has begun testing using store staff for last mile deliveries.\nLastly, startups like Curbside are working with major companies like CVS, Pizza Hut and Yelp, to expand access to same-day pickup services, too. (Target had also worked with Curbside before.)\n\u201cTarget is seizing a tremendous opportunity to leverage local delivery as a retail differentiator,\u201d said Rob Howard, Grand Junction\u2019s founder and CEO, who will become a vice president of technology at Target, as a result of this deal. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled about helping to pursue this opportunity, and to join Target at this unprecedented time in retail.\u201d\nThe move could help Target retain its footing as more brick-and-mortar stores face waning foot traffic and store closures. Target\u2019s online sales have been improving, having rose 22 percent in the last quarter, but it still faces huge threats from Amazon and Walmart in this area. That\u2019s especially true when it comes to groceries \u2013 something that\u2019s been made worse by Amazon\u2019s acquisition of Whole Foods. However, Target recently boosted its Q2 earnings forecast due to an expected increase in comparable-store sales."}

Almost half of the incidents were recorded in the North East of Scotland.\nHowever, the League Against Cruel Sports said it believed the fox hunting figures would be much higher were it not for \u201csub-standard legislation\u201d preventing successful prosecutions.\nThe killing of foxes with hounds was outlawed in 2002, but dogs can still be used to \u201cflush out\u201d foxes and chase them towards the hunts, where the animals are shot.\nLast year a review of the ban carried out by Lord Bonomy estimated that around one in five fox hunts in Scotland resulted in the animal being killed by hounds rather than shot.\nHis report said the figure \u2013 which was based on \u201canecdotal evidence\u201d \u2013 would be equivalent to 160 foxes being killed in this way every year, proposing a system of independent monitoring of hunts.\nREAD MORE: Storm Caroline: Scotland wakes to snow as storm leaves winter chill\n\u201cIncidents involving hunting with dogs are at a record high which is clearly cause for concern,\u201d said Robbie Marsland, director of the League Against Cruel Sports in Scotland.\n\u201cLast year saw the first conviction for illegal fox hunting since the legislation came into force 15 years ago which used League evidence to convict two hunters.\n\u201cWe are working with the Government and the Parliament to strengthen the legislation, which is long overdue, to ensure fox hunting is really banned in Scotland.\u201d\nGrowing dissatisfaction with the legislation prompted Scottish Green MSP Alison Johnstone to bring forward a member\u2019s bill at Holyrood with the aim of imposing a total ban on fox hunting.\n\u201cThese figures add weight to the case for a proper ban on fox hunting,\u201d she said yesterday. \u201cThe public are understandably horrified that animal cruelty is continuing despite the intentions of the 2002 legislation to ban hunting with dogs.\u201d\nShe added that the Scottish Government \u2013 which is currently consulting on Lord Bonomy\u2019s recommendations \u2013 should go further and \u201coffer the option of a proper ban\u201d.\nOverall, the annual Wildlife Crime report shows reported crimes have dropped from 284 in 2014-15 to 261 in 2015-16.

{"id":"fd5e8b7e-aabd-4524-933f-f8fb44a4c1a8","text":"Apple Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) earnings report was certainly awaited with trepidation from investors. And yes, it was justified. The fiscal first-quarter was fairly mixed. So far today, AAPL stock is off about 3.86%.\nBut keep in mind there had already been ample selling off. Over the past few weeks, AAPL stock has gone from $180 to $163. (And is now about $161).\nSo let\u2019s take a look at the quarter. Earnings rose 16% to $3.89 a share, up from the Wall Street forecast of $3.86 per share. As for the top line, the revenues jumped by 13% to $88.3 billion, which beat the consensus of $87.28 billion.\nBut there were two big-time issues with the quarter for AAPL.\nFirst there was the guidance. For the current quarter, the company expects revenues to range between $60 billion to $62 billion. However, analysts were looking for a more robust $65.73 billion. There was also disappointment with gross margins. AAPL predicts they will be 38% to 38.5%, below the Street\u2019s 38.9%\nNext, the company showed weakness with the iPhone. Note that units sales reached 77.3 million, down from 78 million in the year-ago quarter. Oh, and Wall Street was looking for 80 million.\nBut this should be no surprise. AAPL was late with the launch of the iPhone X. And besides, there weren\u2019t as many must-have features to gin up demand, especially in light of the hefty $999 price tag.\nAAPL Stock And The iPhone\nAAPL has been working hard to expand its revenue base. The \u201cOther Products\u201d segment \u2014 which includes the Apple Watch, Apple TV and AirPods \u2014 posted an impressive 36% increase in revenues to $5.5 billion.\nThere was also strength in the services business \u2014 including the App store, Apple Pay and Apple Music \u2014 which saw revenues rise by 18% to $8.47 billion. So Apple is certainly having a lot of success monetizing its base of 1.3 billion phone users.\nYet the diversification efforts have not been without issues. Just look at the HomePod \u2014 Apple\u2019s smart speaker. The company delayed its launch, which meant missing the all-important holiday season. The result was that rivals like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) have been able to capitalize on this massive opportunity.\nNow despite all the diversification efforts, the fact remains that more than two-thirds of revenues come from the iPhone. So the sluggishness with unit volumes is definitely worrisome.\nFor the most part, the anticipated \u201cupgrade supercycle\u201d just never materialized.\nBottom Line On Apple Stock\nAlready analysts are getting cautious on AAPL stock. For example, KeyBanc Capital Markets\u2019 Andy Hargreaves has noted: \u201cSoft iPhone sell-through suggests a saturated market and the lack of gross margin upside reduces our view of potential profit growth.\u201d His price target on Apple stock is $178 and he has lowered his rating from overweight to sector weight.\nNow it\u2019s true that AAPL has a massive cash hoard, which will likely mean more share buybacks and dividends increases. There may even be some interesting acquisitions.\nWhat\u2019s more, AAPL stock is at a reasonable valuation. Consider that the forward price-to-earnings ratio is at 13X. By comparison, Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) is at 22X and GOOGL trades at 23X.\nBut again, the iPhone is what matters for AAPL stock. And for the most part, it looks like there will not be much momentum \u2014 which means that the shares may wind up languishing for awhile.\nTom Taulli is the author of High-Profit IPO Strategies, All About Commodities and All About Short Selling.

And don\u2019t blame him for taking the carrot when it was dangled after he said he was going to take a year\u2019s sabbatical. Had Toronto head coach Marc Trestman not come calling, down a body following the departure of Marcus Brady to the NFL\u2019s Indianapolis Colts, Calvillo probably would have remained out of the game for at least a year, working on his playbook and returning to a normal life.\n\u201cThe last year just sucked the energy out of me. After the last game, I was thinking to myself, this has not been fun. If I\u2019m thinking that, I have to take a step back,\u201d Calvillo told the Montreal Gazette on Monday from Toronto, when his hiring as the Argos\u2019 quarterbacks coach was finally confirmed.\n\u201cI knew, deep in my heart, I still had the passion to coach. I just couldn\u2019t afford to go through another year close to what we went through.\u201d\nMuch like 20 years ago, when Calvillo had a decision to make as a player following three miserable seasons in Hamilton \u2014 sign with Montreal and back up Tracy Ham or go to Saskatchewan, where he likely would have started \u2014 he has reached another crossroads in his journey.\nCalvillo guessed correctly back then, just as he has this time. In signing with Toronto, he goes to the defending Grey Cup champions. He\u2019ll learn how to coach at the feet of Trestman, who led the Als to three Cup appearances and two titles during his five seasons in Montreal. And Calvillo will have a quarterback to work with in Ricky Ray, the 38-year-old about to begin his 16th Canadian Football League season.\nBut most of all, Calvillo\u2019s coaching career will return to some sense of normalcy and balance. Trestman is unlikely to get fired. Tommy Condell, one of the game\u2019s brightest young minds, is the Argos\u2019 offensive coordinator. There\u2019s stability in the organization.\nDuring his three seasons on the Als\u2019 sideline, Calvillo worked for four head coaches. He was supposed to be a position coach but, with so much chaos and disarray, was thrust into a coordinator\u2019s role too prematurely. And that was starting to affect Calvillo\u2019s psyche.\n\u201cThe thing is, I accepted that responsibility. It\u2019s a two-way street when it comes to that,\u201d said Calvillo, always a loyal employee. \u201cI think they believed I could get the job done, and I\u2019ll always appreciate that. I wanted to do it and believed I could.\n\u201cThat hasn\u2019t changed in this profession. My playing days \u2026 I believed I could get the job done (after Hamilton). I have confidence in my coaching ability. But I knew, coaching-wise, if there was another bad year, it was going to affect me and how I felt about this game.\u201d\nThe wear and tear of working in the Als\u2019 organization, mentoring ineffective quarterbacks and trying to find ways for the futile offence to score points, exacted a toll on Calvillo. That much was clear from his expression and body language during games. Nonetheless, he said he learned from Tom Higgins, who provided him with his first coaching opportunity, along with general manager\/head coach Jim Popp, also his GM in Toronto, and Jacques Chapdelaine, all of whom tried getting blood from a stone.\nCalvillo departs the Alouettes with his head high, knowing there are plenty of skeletons in the Als\u2019 closet, but too classy and professional to provide details of this long-standing train wreck.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to go there. I have too much respect for that organization. I\u2019m always going to wish them the best,\u201d said Calvillo, who allowed new Montreal head coach Mike Sherman to pick his brain following his December hiring, but denied there was anything Sherman could have said to sway his decision.\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough to see where it is right now,\u201d Calvillo added. \u201cI hope things get turned around.\u201d\nBut that is no longer his problem. Montreal will remain the site of the family residence and, with three bye weeks in the schedule, Calvillo won\u2019t be a stranger to the city. If putting on an Argos\u2019 golf shirt for the first time was strange for Calvillo, he realizes it\u2019s part of his new reality.\n\u201cWe all have history in our profession. Some of us start out really fast, others don\u2019t. He\u2019s got some scars, like we all do,\u201d said Trestman, knowing the abyss from which Calvillo has escaped.\nTrestman realized Calvillo was the obvious choice, but spoke to Alouettes co-owner Andrew Wetenhall first, to receive his blessing. Then he gave Calvillo about a week to decide. And Calvillo will be involved under Trestman, working on game plans, protections and tinkering, when necessary, with Ray\u2019s fundamentals and mechanics because, as Trestman said, every quarterback needs to be coached, even the great ones.\n\u201cHe understands our offence, he knows how to teach \u2026 and he\u2019s a great communicator,\u201d Trestman said. \u201cI can learn from him. He can learn from us. And Ricky will listen to him.\u201d\nhzurkowsky@postmedia.com\ntwitter.com\/HerbZurkowsky1"}

Local resident Amy Bonner O\u2019Brien responded: \u201cYep, Rebekah Martinez is on this season of The Bachelor.\u201d\nDespite being in plain sight on The Bachelor as a contestant since the season premiere on Jan. 1, Rebekah Martinez, known on the show as Bekah M, was one of those in the story. Her mother reported her missing on Nov. 18 around 1 a.m., saying she had last had contact with her daughter on Nov. 12. Martinez\u2019s mother reportedly told the sheriff\u2019s department that her daughter had come to Humboldt County to work on a marijuana farm.

The Bruy\u00e8re does not permit MAID on its own premises and its staff do not assess patients to determine whether they qualify for MAID. However, Bruy\u00e8re has referred patients to medical assessors outside the hospital, and has allowed for some assessments to take place in the hospital on compassionate grounds.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tightrope that can be walked,\u201d says Dr. Carol Wiebe, Bruy\u00e8re\u2018s vice-president of medical affairs. \u201cWe look at it on an individual basis. If the patient is so frail that it would increase their distress, we have invited assessors in,\u201d she said.\nRelated\n\u201cI find by really focusing on the patient, there are a number of factors that make it easy to walk the tightrope,\u201d she said. These factors include having outside partners like the Ottawa Hospital.\n\u201cIt can be done sensitively while respecting our Catholic roots and the rights our patients have.\u201d\nWhen MAID became legal in Canada in June 2016, the legislation upheld the conscience rights of health practitioners to refuse to provide assisted dying. Catholic and other religious hospitals and long-term care homes said they would not permit MAID on their premises. Last fall, draft guidelines from the Catholic Health Association of Ontario, which represents Catholic hospitals, nursing homes and homes for the aged, discouraged conversations about assisted death in Catholic hospitals and urged that patients be transferred off-site for consultations. Meanwhile, critics have argued that publicly-funded hospitals should not be allowed to opt out of providing MAID to patients who seek it.\nDue to privacy reasons, Wiebe would not say exactly how many Bruy\u00e8re patients have accessed MAID, but said the number is less than five.\nBesides having a partnership with The Ottawa Hospital, Bruy\u00e8re also has a partnership with the Montfort Hospital for assessing francophone patients, although no patients have accessed MAID at the Montfort. Bruy\u00e8re has also had discussions with the Queensway-Carleton Hospital.\nWiebe also declined to put a number on the requests for assessments from patients at Bruy\u00e8re, but says these requests are not unusual.\n\u201cOur teams are fielding questions on a daily basis from patients and families,\u201d she said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t discouraging conversations, because they often provide a springboard to better understand any suffering.\n\u201cWe are frank that we are not participating in assessments or provision of MAID, but in order to accompany patients on their journey, we need to be able to respond to their questions. We still transfer our patients out for MAID.\u201d\nOften requests for an assessment do not lead to MAID. Many end-of-life patients have delirium and may not have the clear mind that is necessary to make a decision, said Wiebe.\nLate last month, The Ottawa Hospital presented a report on its experience to date with MAID to the Champlain Local Health Integration Network. While there are no definitive numbers of assisted deaths in the Champlain LHIN, which covers most of Eastern Ontario, the provincial coroner\u2019s office reported between 61 and 78 MAID cases in the region as of June 30. The Ottawa Hospital was the provider of MAID in 46 of these cases. Of these, 17 MAID deaths were in the community, including patient homes and retirement homes. The hospital\u2019s medical team also provided 102 assessments.\nThe Ottawa Hospital\u2019s chief of staff, Dr. Jeffrey Turnbull, has said the regional care coordination service would use the knowledge and experience the hospital has gained to help patients navigate the system and help identify resources and gaps in the system. It would also allow other hospitals, long-term care facilities, retirement homes and health care providers to coordinate their services.\nWiebe said she is pleased to hear that The Ottawa Hospital is taking the initiative on MAID.\n\u201cThey have been a fabulous partner. It has worked very well to offer us access and compassionate care.\u201d"}

This definition can be broken down into two categories \u2013 financial services and financial management.\nFinancial management is about using the organizational funds in a more efficient and effective manner, whether in a business set-up, non-profit agency or a government entity. Financial managers usually devise and implement strategies to expand profitability within an organization.\nOn the other hand, the financial services industry, is about moving funds between servers and borrowers, supervising investment accounts, assembling capital for governments and businesses, providing investment advice and reducing the risks of financial loss.\nIn this sector, Professionals have to deal with the debt market, capital market, futures and commodities, hedge funds, mergers & acquisitions, or work in stress fewer areas like banking and insurance sectors and corporate finance. There are various opportunities in accounting and finance jobs where you can learn and grow.\nEducational Qualifications for Careers in Finance\n1.College Degree: Usually most of the career tracks, mainly at the entry-level, need nothing more than a college degree. A liberal arts degree is a good way to start but having specializations in subjects like economics, finance, business and accounting are going to prove beneficial and help you get various accounting jobs.\n2.MBA Degree: Many consider MBA degree as a \u2018pseudo-requirement\u2019, just a screening tool which helps employers shortlist candidates from a huge pool of applicants. So even though a college degree with a relevant major plus on-the-job training can suffice, an MBA degree has the potential to give you an edge in recruitment as well as in promotions and remuneration.\n3.Law Degree: The financial services industry is heavily regulated \u2013 whether personal finance, corporate finance, wealth management or insurance \u2013 so having a law degree is going to be an advantage. For instance, a financial planner would have to deal with laws relating to estates, trusts, real estate and inheritance whereas asset managers look after the affairs of the super-wealthy may need to offer tax advice on a complex pool of assets.\n4.Computer Literacy: Finance professionals are the ones who have to process and analyze data on regular basis, mainly at junior levels, such as financial analysts and even associates, who do all the grunge work. This is most efficiently done by computer software, which helps create databases, with computation and modelling, and preparing charts, graphs and tables.\nCareer Tracks and Salaries in Finance\nFinance sector is not only an interesting sector to work in but also a rewarding sector too.\nThe salary of a finance specialist almost always involves a bonus or a commission component, which is added to your salary or \u2018base pay\u2019. Bonuses are a larger part of one\u2019s paycheck at investment banks, asset management firms and brokerages than they are in banking and insurance.\nAlso, every time you step up or get promoted, a huge percentage of your wages comes in the form of bonuses, which are driven by a combination of your department\u2019s profits and those of the company. Unlike bonuses, commissions are formulaic.\nEmployees like financial advisors who receive commissions generally work in sales positions. Revenues generated by their clients as well as other key metrics such as the value of their clients\u2019 accounts drive your commission. In case, you are looking for opportunities, jobs in Noida and Jobs in Gurgaon in the same field are available.\nAuthor: The author is a working professional at EXL Services.\nFor more information about the career in finance please visit at our career page @ https:\/\/outtowin.exlservice.com\/"}

Now, as an agency social worker, I\u2019ve never been happier\nIn July 2016, I left behind a 12-year career as a family and childcare social worker to move into the arts. I was frustrated by the lack of opportunities for progression and needed a new challenge. But after only 18 months aways from the profession, I have returned.\nSix reasons to celebrate World Social Work Day Read more\nLeaving social care was a big decision, a quantum change. Both my parents were social workers \u2013 my father even had an MBE for services to disability. This, and my interest in social justice, drew me to the profession.\nAs a new graduate in Northern Ireland in the noughties, I worked in the field of arts and disability and trained in the person-centred approach. The American psychologist Carl Rogers drew me in to the approach. I was impressed by the way it valued the individual and celebrated self-determination. I wanted to empower people and to give them the respect they deserved.\nWorking in family and childcare, I was able to put the person-centred approach into action, both with young people and vulnerable parents. I also got to train in child development. I had a great line manager in my first job as a social worker for looked-after children at the Belfast health and social care trust. She taught me things that have stayed with me and helped me through many complex cases.\nBut as time went on, I think I went into a state of burnout; I had a couple of personal bereavements and experienced postnatal depression. These things can change a person and after a while I started to want a fresh beginning and to leave the past behind.\nI moved on to arts work in the voluntary sector. But it just wasn't a person-centred world \u2013 and I missed that\nUnfortunately, by this stage the effects of austerity were hitting the trust and there was little opportunity to transfer. I would have liked to have moved into adult services \u2013 I felt it would bring me into contact with different theories and new concepts.\nI became impatient and disillusioned and moved on to arts work in the voluntary sector. Initially, I was happy to leave social care. I felt relieved to operate outside the statutory role and use my creativity to help people develop empathy and self-compassion. I thought I would never miss social work.\nBut soon I was struck by practices I hadn\u2019t seen in social services, such as waiving inclusive participation in decision making, where people with mental health problems were not invited to meetings or meetings were not scheduled at times to suit service users.\nI also found that governance was underdeveloped. It just wasn\u2019t a person-centred world and I missed that.\nI even missed the vast paper chains in social work. I know it is arduous and stressful, but it is a good and honest thing to record everything and to stand over your every decision.\nSo at the beginning of this year, I returned to social work. Back to the legal duty to safeguard people\u2019s wellbeing, back to where I know how to challenge practice, and back to where I can be represented by a union \u2013 if need be.\nI had lost sight of the benefits social workers can bring to people\u2019s lives, and how their work is vital. I had thought a less well-paid job would mean less stress, but I was actually more stressed and often bored.\nAs an agency social worker, I am better paid and less stressed. My manager has taken the time to consider my interests and match me to a suitable post. I was able to choose my assignment and chose what I thought was the most stimulating option. In a sense, it\u2019s person-centred recruitment.\nThe agency is supporting me in training as a Northern Ireland Social Care Council advocate for social work, arts and mental health and I am working with a poet to put together an arts programme for World Mental Health Day in October.\nIt is an exciting and changing area of social work employment, offering the choice and movement I had originally lacked. It also affords me a chance to express my creativity within safe bounds. My relationship with my managers is respectful and flexible, giving me the sense of self-determination I had originally wanted to bring to others through social work.\nWhy I became a social worker Read more\nThe grass is not always greener on the other side. I am much less anxious than I was six months ago and I believe I have agency social work to thank for that.\nPaula Matthews is an agency social worker\nJoin the Social Care Network for comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

It is against the ethos of humanity for us to accept what is going on with our young people today.\n\u201cSo, I came to see the president to explain what we are doing in Edo State and to solicits more federal support for our actions.\u201d\nOn some returnees expressing dissatisfaction with the stipend given them, the governor said, \u201cthat is part of the challenge. The issues are very complex.\u201d\nThe first set that were brought back by International Organisation for Migration (IOM) were given stipend but the last wave of returnees that were repatriated nothing was given to them and they were a bit agitated.\n\u201cWhat we have done in Edo is to help returnees settle and reintegrated into their families, we give them stipend for three months. So what we have done this time around is to bring them to Benin City and then give them first stipend to go back home and then be able to attend the skills acquisition centers which we have set up to train them.\u201d\nAnother request was the bad portion of Benin Auchi Road, which Obaseki said, \u201cwe did not spend a lot of money but fortunately the Federal Government has responded to the issue of the Benin-Auchi road. As I speak now, the minister for Works is inspecting what has been done on the road and for those who have the benefit of using that road in the past three months, you will acknowledge that the Federal Government has done quite good remedial work and we hope to that with the funds that have been released to pay the contractors that they will now begin proper work.\u201d"}

Fortunately for Gaine, there is good value for offensive tackles beginning midway through the second round and extending through the fourth round.\nOf the Texans\u2019 eight draft choices, four are in the third and fourth rounds, so they should have an interesting group of tackle prospects from which to choose.\nGaine hasn\u2019t disclosed what positions he\u2019s targeting, but everyone knows finding an offensive tackle who can help protect second-year quarterback Deshaun Watson is paramount.\nMore Information About the draft When: 7 p.m. Thursday (round 1); 6 p.m. Friday (rounds 2-3); 11 a.m. Saturday (rounds 4-7). Where: Arlington. TV: ESPN, ESPN2, Fox, NFL Network.\n\u201cWithout getting into particulars of what\u2019s strong and what\u2019s weak, I would say that when I\u2019m looking at the draft board, I\u2019m looking at it vertically and horizontally,\u201d Gaine said. \u201cWhat I mean by that is there are opportunities I see \u2014 regardless of position \u2014 to populate our roster with contributing players at every level of this draft: day one, day two and day three.\n\u201cThe part that excites me is there are some late-round options we feel would be good developmental, upside players (with) potential to contribute for us as well.\u201d\nTranslator To read this article in one of Houston's most-spoken languages, click on the button below.

Thanks!\nSon of \u2018Zeus\u2019\nThe Texans won\u2019t have a shot at the two-best offensive tackles \u2014 Notre Dame\u2019s Mike McGlinchey and Texas\u2019 Connor Williams, both of whom project as first-round picks. UCLA\u2019s Kolton Miller also could be a first-round selection.\nOregon\u2019s Tyrell Crosby and Penn State\u2019s Brian O\u2019Neill are almost guaranteed of being drafted in the second round.\nBecause of a shortage at the most important position on the offensive line and because a few tackle prospects project to guard early in their careers, others are expected to be gone before the Texans make the fourth pick in the third round.\nAs the Texans continue their offseason program, their top-four tackles are Juli\u00e9n Davenport, Seantrel Henderson, Kendall Lamm and David Quessenberry. And Quessenberry\u2019s best position may be guard.\nGaine may also add to the competition with a second tackle taken with one of his three picks in the sixth round.\nDavenport was a fourth-round pick last year. He started four games, including two at left tackle, and that position is his to lose. But he\u2019s going to be pushed.\nSome tackles who could be available early in the third round are Oklahoma\u2019s Orlando Brown, TCU\u2019s Joseph Noteboom, Mississippi State\u2019s Martinas Rankin, Western Michigan\u2019s Chukwuma Okorafor, Ohio State\u2019s Jamarco Jones, Louisville\u2019s Geron Christian, North Carolina State\u2019s Will Richardson and North Carolina A&T\u2019s Brandon Parker.\nIt\u2019ll be interesting to see if the Texans will take Brown if he\u2019s available. Brown, son of the late offensive tackle, Orlando \u201cZeus\u201d Brown, was projected as a first-round pick coming out of the season and before his horrendous performance at the combine, where he was slow, weak and not athletic.\nDevlin\u2019s opinion counts\nSome scouts insist Brown will have to play the right side. Others believe he\u2019ll have to move inside. But some think he\u2019s still ticketed for left tackle, and a team that gets him after the first round could be getting a tremendous deal.\nThe scouts and offensive line coach Mike Devlin have thoroughly evaluated Brown and the other prospects for months. Devlin\u2019s opinion counts.\nLast year, Devlin played a significant role in the selection of Davenport. Devlin worked out Davenport at Bucknell and spent a lot of time visiting with him before recommending him to coach Bill O\u2019Brien and former general manager Rick Smith.\nThis year, Devlin has to do it again. It\u2019s essential the Texans improve their line in the draft, despite signing three unrestricted free agents \u2014 guards Zach Fulton and Senio Kelemete and Henderson, who started one game the last two years at Buffalo.\nThe only surprise in the third round would if Gaine used the three picks to fill other needs, but that\u2019s not likely to happen because it\u2019s not a secret that offensive tackle is the team\u2019s most pressing need.\njohn.mcclain@chron.com\ntwitter.com\/mcclain_on_nfl"}

According to Lowe, some teams already had a \"No Cousins\" policy \u2014 and that was before Cousins tore his Achilles tendon in January, ending his season with the New Orleans Pelicans.\nThat Cousins, a player with an already shaky reputation, would suffer an historically debilitating injury in an offseason with limited cap space and a somewhat muted free agency, caused the perfect storm.\nThe Pelicans may not have wanted to keep Cousins in the first place\nAccording to Lowe, the Pelicans had considered offering Cousins a two-year deal worth much less than the max. As Lowe noted, the Pelicans never held a meeting with Cousins in free agency, and it's possible that they already didn't have much interest in re-signing him once his injury occurred.\nAdvertisement\nPlayers recovering from torn Achilles do not have a great track record of returning to their normal selves. Cousins' injury forced the Pelicans to experiment with playing Anthony Davis at center more, and they acquired stretch forward Nikola Mirotic, who proved to be an excellent front-court partner with Davis.\nThe Pelicans' run to the second round of the playoffs after sweeping the Portland Trail Blazers in the first may have eventually caused them to pivot away from Cousins. When Julius Randle became available on Monday, they did just that, signing the versatile big man to a two-year deal.\nThe nature of Cousins and his injury didn't help Cousins' cause once he became available. It's unclear what was offered to him. Cousins told Marc Spears of The Undefeated that he didn't receive any offers. According to Lowe, once the Pelicans signed Randle, Cousins told his agent to begin calling teams, including the Warriors.\nThe Warriors were one of the few teams that could roll the dice\nWhat deals would have worked out for Cousins and potential suitors? How many teams would take a chance on Cousins on a one-year deal, using up valuable money, knowing he might not play this season or be himself this season if he does?\nLowe reported that some teams may have offered two-year deals around $9 million, knowing it would reward Cousins and give them some security, keeping Cousins next season at a cheap rate if he returns to full health and effectiveness. But that's an unsavory option for Cousins, who, in his prime, wants to prove himself worthy of a max contract for next season.\nAdvertisement\nEnter the Warriors, a team who can afford to take a risk. The Warriors have won three championships in four years with a rotating cast of centers, from Andrew Bogut to Festus Ezeli, Zaza Pachulia, JaVale McGee, and Kevon Looney. They're at their best when the 6-foot-6 Draymond Green is playing center, anyway. They have four All-Stars in their prime and the widest margin for error in the NBA.\nOne of the Warriors few weaknesses was the center spot, so they rolled the dice on the highest-upside center available, knowing that player might not contribute anything this season.\nIt's a one-year deal that works for both sides. If Cousins returns, plays well, and helps win a championship, he'll hit the open market next season a winner looking for a max. The signing, meanwhile, would obviously become a win for the Warriors if that happens, even if it's a one-year rental. If Cousins never returns to himself on the floor \u2014 well, the Warriors cut their losses after one season.\nAs Lowe also noted, the cap spike of 2016 and the free agency madness that followed contributed to this. The cap spike allowed the Warriors the cap space to sign Kevin Durant that summer. The signings that followed the cap spike around the NBA clogged teams' payrolls this season, meaning few teams wanted to dip their toes in the water this summer. The Warriors pounced when a top player became available.\nNow begins one of the most fascinating experiments in the NBA. Cousins' style of play doesn't fit the Warriors very well. He likes to control the ball, he rarely runs back on offense or defense, and he's been criticized for having a negative effect on locker rooms throughout his career. Cousins is also a gifted passer, a true low-post threat, a good shooter, and a capable defender when engaged. How many of those things the Warriors will get on a consistent basis, without the aforementioned negatives, is unclear.\nAdvertisement\nIt's a signing that has a variety of outcomes. Cousins might not return or be effective at all. He might be 50% of himself, contribute in some ways, but ultimately not be a missing piece for a Warriors team going for a three-peat.\nOr he could return, prove himself one of the NBA's best big men and help the Warriors win a third straight title, making all parties happy when July 1 hits next year."}

Efforts at wishing away the problem associated with Nigerian federation have only resulted into several tribal, ethnic and religious movements that have even metamorphosed into terrorist syndicates.\n\u201cOne can, therefore, no longer fold his arms but engage some of the issues that have confronted us as a nation and threatened the Nigerian federation. This forum provides one of the opportunities for such interrogation. Accordingly, I commend the organisers for bringing this issue to the front burner once again.\n\u201cThat Nigeria could survive despite predictions to the contrary by the World Powers not only portrays a ray of hope but also demonstrate that Nigerian Federation has come to stay.\n\u201cNigeria is far behind many Nations and everything possible should be done to takeNigeria to where it rightly belongs among the comity of Nations given her huge and rich minerals and agricultural resources, and population.\n\u201cIt is therefore incumbent on us to fashion out our own type of federalism that is best suited to our people and to local circumstances. There should be genuine efforts to build the nation. Therefore ethnic, religious and sectional agenda should take back place. The essence of federalism is to foster unity and development. This has however, not been achieved.\n\u201cConsequently, the recruitment processes of our elective office holders are being re-visited in the Electoral Amendment Bill to ensure that the system is able to recruit the best at all strata of leadership. We need leaders who are visionary, selfless, prudent, intelligent and indefatigable and having integrity and honour.\u201d\nHe added that the current National Assembly had shown enough determination to ensure that the federation of Nigeria is managed effectively for the good of every citizen in its several initiatives to address imbalances.\nHon Dogara stated, \u201cThere should be massive awareness to change the mindsets of the rulers and the ruled. This is where there is the need for proper education and awareness for both the rulers and the ruled. I challenge our tertiary institutions to break the disconnect between them and the political institutions and industries not only to fashion out the appropriate curriculum to drive this new orientation to confront our political and economic malaise but also to lead cutting edge research in providing correct local solutions to our diverse of problems.\u201d\nThe speaker also identified some emerging issues in Nigeria\u2019s federation political gerrymandering, corruption and nepotism, state creation and boundary delimitation, electoral boundary manipulation that discriminates against voters on account of tribe, language, religion, or related status.\n\u201cThe same is also true of boundary adjustments, state creation and Local Governments in Nigeria. The minority tribes have complained of being short-changed. The issue of fiscal federalism and resource control.\n\u201cThe allocation of revenue in Nigeria is presently heated as there are always allegations and counter-allegations of manipulations against the federal government by states. There are also allegations of zero allocation to local governments by states despite very clear constitutional provisions. In addition, there has been complaint of total neglect of the states that generate the revenue as such the derivative formula has been very contentious. There is over concentration of powers and responsibilities on the federal government. There are several responsibilities that can better be handled by the states.\n\u201cThe power sharing between the Federal Government and the states will have to be revisited and the issue of the autonomy of local governments in Nigeria which state Houses of Assembly keep voting against,\u201d he further stated.\nDogara added, \u201cThe issue of resource control must be properly addressed. The communities where those resources are found should be adequately compensated. The Host Community Bill initiated by the House of Representatives on the Oil and Gas industry will be a test case. The call for resource control may by implication have a semblance of territorial devolution.\u201d"}

Current plans show the building's height would be taller than currently allowed under village code and setback variances would be needed on three sides.\n\"From what I see of the density of this project leads me to believe it is too large for the property,\" Oppenheim said. \"There is not quite enough room on the site for what you are talking about now.\"\nVarying slightly from the plans Gilbane initially submitted to the village, Shawn Zimny, a company vice president, said the project would include a mix of 212 one- and two-bedroom luxury apartments ranging in size from 500 to 1,600 square feet. He said rents are projected to start at $1,350 a month and top out at $3,200. The building will be four stories.\n\"Some of the two-bedrooms will be two stories,\" Zimny said. \"These (units) will be a highly amenitized luxury project.\"\nThough there will be few if any school age children living there, according to Zimny, he said the apartments are not geared to one specific market. He expects a mix of singles between 35 and 54 as well as young professionals and empty nesters.\nOppenheim was not alone with her concerns. Commissioners Al Bromberg and Stuart Shayman also voiced objections.\nBromberg said the project will need a lot of work before Gilbane returns for its public hearing. Oppenheim wanted to know if Gilbane was willing to shrink the size of the project to better fit the property. Zimny was reluctant to make that commitment.\n\"We can make some calculations but at some point the project will not be feasible to build,\" Zimny said.\nRepresentatives of Rochelle Zell Jewish High School, which is located immediately to the north of the proposed development, and Congregation B'nai Jehoshua Beth Elohim, just southwest of the site, said they do not want to see it built.\nAlan Frankel, a member of the Rochelle Zell Board of Directors, said the school was built with security concerns in mind. He said there is armed security in the building and all classrooms are on the second and third floors. Students currently have a clear view from their classrooms and if the development is built, they will be 70 feet away from apartment windows.\n\"They will have sight lines directly into classroom windows,\" Frankel said. \"Right now there is nothing to obscure the view from our windows. We will not consent to this.\"\nRoy Splansky of Buffalo Grove and a member of B'nai Jehoshua Beth Elohim said he was there representing his synagogue. He said most of the buildings in the immediate vicinity other than the high school were offices in low-rise buildings.\n\"This is not a conforming use for the property and will not conform to the neighborhood,\" Splansky said. \"This is not the place for this kind of PUD development,\" he added referring to a planned unit development.\nTraffic was another concern for the commissioners. Oppenheim said getting in and out of the service roads and onto Lake Cook Road already presents challenges that will be exasperated with the addition of the approximately 350 people who would occupy the units.\n\"That is a lot of people coming in and out of there,\" Oppenheim said. \"It is a very difficult in and out. I see issues with efficiency and safety.\"\nZimny said a similar number of units were built by Amli Deerfield half a mile west in the last two years at Lake Cook and Wilmot roads.

Those conversations may have violated the Logan Act, which aims to bar private citizens from conducting diplomacy, though White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Tuesday that no legal issues arose.\nStill, the centuries-old act has been so rarely invoked that legal experts say it may no longer be valid. And no one has been found guilty of violating the act in its more than 200-year history.\nA look at the Logan Act and whether such conversations could lead to charges.\nAdvertisement\nWHAT IS THE LOGAN ACT?\nLawmakers enacted the Logan Act in 1799 after George Logan, a friend of Thomas Jefferson, made a private visit to France in an attempt to ease tensions with the United States after the French Revolution. That trip was sharply criticized back home as an inappropriate interference in affairs between the two countries, prompting the passage of the law.\nHAS IT EVER BEEN USED BEFORE?\nSince then, there appear to have been very few indictments, and no prosecutions, under the obscure act. Legal experts say that would make potential violations even harder to prove in court.\nThe one known indictment came in 1803 after a Kentucky farmer wrote a newspaper article advocating for a separate country within the United States that would ally with France. But no prosecution followed.\n\u201cIt really is an anachronism,\u201d written during a very different time in diplomatic and constitutional history, said Stephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. \u201cThe statue was written at a time when Congress thought it had the power to criminalize this kind of ill-conceived, but not illegal, speech.\u201d\nOver the years, politicians and public figures have been accused of violating the Logan Act, often by political rivals. The Rev. Jesse Jackson\u2019s diplomatic activities in several countries in the 1980s, including trips to Cuba to negotiate the release of prisoners, raised questions about whether he violated the act. So did former NBA star Dennis Rodman\u2019s travels to North Korea to meet with dictator Kim Jong Un in 2014. Another allegation involved a letter sent by 47 Republican senators to Iran\u2019s leaders in 2015, warning them against making a nuclear deal with Obama.\nNone of those cases yielded criminal charges. A court could find the Logan Act no longer valid under a legal doctrine that says statutes become unenforceable if they are never used.\nIF FLYNN DISCUSSED SANCTIONS, DIDN\u2019T HE BREAK THE LAW?\nDiscussing economic sanctions against Russia with the Russian envoy during the American presidential transition could have been a violation of the act. But that doesn\u2019t mean it will result in charges against Flynn. Prosecutors, for questions of resources or interpretations of the law, sometimes opt not to pursue criminal cases even when presented with a clear violation. And when it comes to the Logan Act, they would have to overcome a difficult defense that Flynn\u2019s phone calls were protected free speech. They would also have to prove Flynn was actually acting without the authority of the United States, Vladeck said.\nAnd then find a prosecutor willing to take the case.\nA U.S. official told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the FBI interviewed Flynn about his actions with the ambassador. But the content of the conversations is unclear.\nThe official was briefed on the investigation but was not authorized to discuss it by name and spoke on condition of anonymity.\nIf Flynn lied to investigators, he would have opened himself up to a possible felony prosecution for making false statements.\nBut Vladeck called threats to prosecute under the Logan Act \u201can increasingly empty gesture.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fun game for commentators to play,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of turning what looks like a really bad move into a potentially illegal one.\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press writer Eric Tucker contributed to this report."}

A closer look at valuation reveals that the company is still considerably undervalued.\nCorporate profile\nYY is an online social entertainment platform that engages users through audio, video and text in a wide range of online group activities, such as music shows, live video streaming and multi-player gaming. Originally an online games web portal, the company has transformed itself into a multifaceted entertainment platform over the past decade. As stated on the company's website, almost all content on the YY platform is user-generated.\nMany people in China still lack access to the internet\nFrom a global perspective, China belongs to one of the most populous countries with still extremely low internet penetration rates. According to a recent study by China internet watch, as of July 2017, there were approximately 750 million internet users in China. This represents an internet penetration rate of 54.3 percent and more than 1 percentage point increase over the 2016 figure. Compared to the United States where almost 90 percent are connected to the internet, this represents a considerable opportunity for all local internet businesses.\nSource: Medium.com\nRevenue growth has slowed down in recent years\nOver the last three years, revenue growth has recorded a CAGR of 65 percent. This rate has however slowed to roughly 40 percent last year and only about 25 percent year-on-year quarterly revenue growth. Even though the decrease in revenue growth might continue, it is likely to stabilize as the business matures.\nA stock Peter Lynch would buy\nBased on Peter Lynch's earnings line, a famous valuation technique that helped the legendary investor to achieve an annualized return of 29 percent and the best 20-year return rate of any mutual fund in history, YY's shares seem to be currently considerably undervalued. Using the Fast Graphs forecasting calculator with 19 percent free cash flow growth assumption, the company's intrinsic value by the end of FY2022 is forecasted to reach $300 USD, which implies almost 27 percent total annualized rate of return upside potential.\nSource: Fastgraphs.com\nDCF valuation\nAccording to my simple DCF blended model, YY's shares are currently trading with roughly 54 percent upside potential. Under the perpetuity growth method, fair value of the stock is almost $142.4, assuming 25 percent revenue growth gradually decreasing by 2 percent annually over the next five years, steady annual EBIT margin of 25 percent and terminal growth rate in perpetuity of 2 percent. Under the EBITDA multiple approach, the intrinsic value stands at almost $125.3 if we assume that the appropriate exit EV\/EBITDA multiple is around 10x.\nThe bottom line\nAlthough YY's growth has slowed significantly in recent years, the company's shares still seem to trade below their fair value based on at least two popular valuation techniques. Based on Peter Lynch's earnings valuation technique, the company offers exceptional return potential. China and particularly its rural areas present an outstanding opportunity for all local internet players, YY including, and therefore continued growth can be expected.\nAuthor's note: To bring similar articles to your attention, please consider subscription of my SA feed by clicking on the ''Follow'' button at the top of this page.\nDisclaimer: Please note that this article has an informative purpose, expresses its author's opinion and do not constitute investment recommendation or advice.

He was charged with something someone else did,\" Sullivan said.\nAaron Hernandez's defense attorney Ron Sullivan spoke out after a jury acquitted his client on two first degree murder charges.\nOne of Aaron Hernandez's lawyers revealed why the defense team wanted to call New England Patriots Coach Bill Belichick as a witness in the ex-NFL star's double murder trial during a radio interview on Monday morning.\nHernandez, who is already serving a life sentence for a 2013 murder, was acquitted Friday in a 2012 double slaying prosecutors had claimed was fueled by his anger over a spilled drink. The defense team claimed Alexander Bradley, a former friend of Hernandez, was responsible for the killings.\nIn an interview on WEEI-FM's \"Kirk & Callahan\" show, attorney Ronald Sullivan said defense lawyers had hoped to ask Belichick about a 2013 trip Hernandez allegedly made to the NFL Combine in Indianapolis to meet with his coach. Sullivan said Hernandez requested a trade because he wanted to get away from New England because he was afraid that Bradley might try to kill him. But Belichick reportedly nixed the trade request.\nInstead, Sullivan said Belichick gave Hernandez some advice on getting another apartment that he could use to lay low and improving his home security system.\n\"Belichick said he would help (Hernandez) with certain security measures here internally in Boston, but that he wasn\u2019t in a position to trade him,\u201d Sullivan told WEEI.\nIn court two weeks ago, it was revealed that an Ohio attorney representing Belichick had called a clerk to inquire about a subpoena he was served in connection with the trial. Belichick reportedly wanted to know if there would be any consequences for not appearing in court.\nOne of Hernandez's attorneys, Jose Baez, told the judge that Belichick's testimony was not \"critical to the defense.\"\nSullivan said in Monday's radio interview that the defense team felt that prosecutors had failed to prove their case, so there was no longer any need for Belichick to testify."}

Michael Flynn\u2019s resignation, after he was found to have lied to Vice President Mike Pence about what he discussed with Russia, many are asking questions about other Russian ties in the White House.\n1. Jack Kingston:\nFormer Rep. Jack Kingston (R-GA) was in Moscow in December meeting with American business leaders to discuss what changes are forthcoming in the relationship between the two nations, Raw Story reported.\n\u201cTrump can look at sanctions,\u201d Kingston told NPR during his overseas visit. \u201cThey\u2019ve been in place long enough. Has the desired result been reached? He doesn\u2019t have to abide by the Obama foreign policy. That gives him a fresh start.\u201d\nKingston served as an advisor to Trump on the campaign and is currently a paid Republican commentator to CNN and in an interview with Jake Tapper, he revealed he works for a law firm that has offices in Russia but claimed he was there as a private citizen.\n2. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson:\nPreviously named \u201cFriend to Putin,\u201d Tillerson learned that doing business in Russia means being on good terms with the country\u2019s president, Politico reported. It was his job as the company\u2019s manager of Exxon\u2019s accounts in Russia to appease the leader and ultimately scored him the position as CEO of Exxon.\nAlexey Pushkov, the head of the foreign affairs committee in the lower house of Russian parliament, said naming Tillerson as Secretary of State would be a \u201csensation,\u201d continuing Tillerson has \u201ca lot of experience working with Russia.\u201d\nDuring his confirmation hearing, the decade and a half relationship Tillerson has with Russia prompted senators to ask if he considers Putin to be a \u201cwar criminal\u201d given his history of support for the Assad regime.\nHe was also hammered on whether he would consider sanctions if the Russians were found to have hacked the U.S. elections. He refused to answer. When it came to being asked about lobbying efforts on behalf of Exxon against Russian sanctions, Tillerson strategically meandered around the truth.\n\u201cI have never lobbied against sanctions personally\u2026 to my knowledge, Exxon never directly lobbied against sanctions,\u201d Tillerson told the confirmation committee. It turns out that claim was false. Government lobbying records show his company paid the Nickles Group over $193,000 in 2014 and 2015 to talk about \u201cissues related to Russian sanctions impacting the energy sector,\u201d Politifact reported.\nIt\u2019s still unclear what Tillerson knew about what Gen. Michael Flynn told to the Russian government and when. As Secretary of State, he should be informed on every facet of foreign policy coming out of the White House.\n3. Steve Bannon:\nWhite House chief strategist Steve Bannon told a gathering of European conservatives in 2014 \u201cwe, the Judeo-Christian West, really have to look at what [Putin]\u2019s talking about as far as traditionalism goes \u2014 particularly the sense of where it supports the underpinnings of nationalism,\u201d the Washington Post reported.\nThat was the same year that Trump was hailed as \u201cthe American Putin\u201d by Russian nationalist Alexander Dugin, a philosopher generally referred to as \u201cPutin\u2019s Rasputin\u201d by Breitbart. Dugin\u2019s beliefs on the evils of liberalism have been quoted by Bannon and other far-right leaders, The Chicago Tribune reported.\n\u201cThe Russian \u2018equivalent\u2019 of Trump putting Bannon on his security council would be if Putin did the same with Dugin,\u201d former U.S. ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul annotated in a blog post.\n4. President Donald Trump:\nIn the words of former Sen. Howard Baker (R-TN), \u201cWhat did the president know and when did he know it?\u201d Baker asked that question during the 1973 Watergate hearing that investigated the cover-up that extended all the way to the office of the president.\nWhen Trump made his first major foreign policy speech in April, Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak was seated on the front row. On the same day that Flynn was talking to the Russian ambassador, prior to the inauguration, Trump tweeted that it was a great move on Putin\u2019s part to delay reaction to U.S. sanctions. Acting Attorney General Sally Yates reportedly told the White House counsel that Flynn gave misleading statements about what he discussed with the Russians. According to the Washington Post, Yates further warned that his lies were so egregious that Flynn opened himself up to possible Russian blackmail because Russia knew he lied to his superiors. The White House never made any corrections to their statements and the White House has not revealed what Trump knew and when he knew it.\nWhen Trump was asked about the report aboard Air Force One on Friday, he claimed he\u2019d not heard the reports about Flynn but would look into it. It took him a full three days to do so, while Flynn was sitting in national security briefings just hours before he resigned.\nRep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) held dozens of hearings on Benghazi under the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.

He was unceremoniously wedged into the third row, where he had to stand, his crutches hidden from view.\u201cThe least you could do is let him sit down\u201d was the wry remark from one Blue Jays official who was looking on.And on it goes for the Blue Jays, where even the subs are starting to get struck down.A utility outfielder, Carrera became the 17th Blue Jays player to be lodged on the 10-day disabled list this season, which isn\u2019t even at the official midway point yet.It has gotten to the point where Toronto manager John Gibbons is getting punchy having to field so many medical inquiries about his wounded warriors.The only upside to the story is that Steve Pearce, the player Carrera was filling in for in left field, is expected to be back with the team as early as this weekend, when Toronto plays host to the Chicago White Sox.Pearce has been out since May 15 recuperating from a right calf strain.The Blue Jays recalled rookie Dwight Smith from their Triple-A affiliate in Buffalo for the third time this season to fill in, and he got the start in left field against the Rays.Smith recorded three hits in the contest, and the Blue Jays would go on to record a satisfying 7-6 comeback victory over the Rays to give Toronto a 1-1 split in the two-game series against its American League East rival.Catcher Russell Martin hit the decisive blow, a solo home run shot off reliever Jose Alvarado, to lead off the bottom of the eighth inning, his sixth of the year.After trailing 2-0 and 3-1, the Blue Jays worked a four-run fifth inning to their advantage, the key blow a three-run home run blow by Kendrys Morales to right field off Tampa Bay starter Jake Odorizzi.That vaulted Toronto in front 5-3.Toronto would extend its lead to 6-3 when Martin scored on a wild pitch in the sixth.But the lead was squandered by the bullpen when Joe Smith, who has been great all season, came on in the top of the eighth and was rocked for three runs \u2013 a two-run homer by Logan Morrison and a sacrifice fly by Derek Norris that knotted things up.Martin\u2019s home run helped sooth the angst Smith was feeling about the blown save while at the same time making him the winner, raising his record to 3-0 on the year.\u201cYou give up a lead, one of our pitchers has been throwing the ball extremely well \u2013 Smitty \u2013 I felt like I picked him up right there,\u201d Martin said about his winning blow. \u201cI felt like the team at that moment needed that.\u201dThe bullpen blowup overshadowed a good outing by Toronto starter Francisco Liriano, who logged seven innings, his longest of the year, allowing three Tampa Bay runs (two earned) off five hits while striking out nine.Roberto Osuna came on in the ninth to retire the side in order and record the save, his 17th of the season.Gibbons said he was as surprised as anyone to learn Wednesday morning that Carrera\u2019s foot was broken. He knew he\u2019d hurt it somewhat during the game but did not think anything more of it when Carrera was able to continue playing.Even Carrera was caught off guard by the severity, especially after X-rays after the game indicated all was clear.But when he could not stand on the foot the following morning, he knew something was amiss and alerted the beleaguered Blue Jays medical team. A CT scan was ordered, and it revealed a bone fracture.Carrera said he is going to see a foot specialist and has no clear indication how long he might be sidelined.\u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things we cannot control,\u201d the Venezuelan-born Carrera said before the game through an interpreter. \u201cYou get hurt.

A user on Twitter has shown how the Face Unlock can be easily fooled by a simple photo. OnePlus in its response has said the feature is \u2018designed for convenience\u2019 and that they still recommend users rely on pin\/pattern\/fingerprint for extra security.\nA Twitter user with the handle @rikvduijn shared a video of how his friend used a photo of \u2018rik\u2019 with the OnePlus 6, which easily unlocked. In the video, the friend is using a mask like cut-out of the user\u2019s face, and the phone was tricked by the same. However, it has been revealed that the same problem does not appear to be true for the OnePlus 5T, where using a cut-out of someone\u2019s face did not confuse the Face Unlock feature. Rik also posted that OnePlus had contacted him, and said they were investigating the issue.\nOnePlus in its statement said, \u201cWe designed Face Unlock around convenience, and while we took corresponding measures to optimise its security we always recommended you use a password\/PIN\/fingerprint for security. For this reason, Face Unlock is not enabled for any secure apps such as banking or payments. We\u2019re constantly working to improve all of our technology, including Face Unlock.\u201d\nAlso read: OnePlus 6 review: A no-nonsense flagship\nOnePlus\u2019 statement hints that the Face Unlock feature might not be so secure on its own. It is unclear if the company will be issuing a bug fix for the Face Unlock feature. What is scary is that someone can unlock the device with just a large printed photo. Clearly relying on just Face Unlock for the OnePlus 6 might not be such a secure idea, till the company issues a fix.\nCheck out Rik\u2019s tweet below\nI printed my face to unlock my OnePlus 6 for the lulz\u2026 it worked \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af pic.twitter.com\/rAVMq8JKBr \u2014 rik (@rikvduijn) May 29, 2018\nIt should be noted that biometrics in particular are never considered as entirely secure on their own. We have seen in the past how fingerprints can be cloned, iris scanners on phones can be fooled etc. Face Unlock feature might have become common on most phones, but this is still a software driven feature, which makes it not so secure. In Apple\u2019s case, the company is relying on hardware to power Face ID on the iPhone X. This includes a TrueDepth camera, an Infrared camera, a Flood illuminator, and a Dot Projector. Apple\u2019s Face ID uses a detailed depth map of the face to recognise the user, and it cannot be fooled by masks, even 3D masks.\nAlso read: OnePlus 6 \u2018Always-On Display\u2019 removed via official update due to \u2018battery saving concerns\u2019\nOnePlus 6 is already on sale in India at a starting price of Rs 34,999 while the price of the 8GB RAM and 128GB storage variant is Rs 39,999. OnePlus 6 has an Avengers Limited edition as well for a starting price of Rs 44,999, though this version comes in only 8GB RAM and 256GB storage .\nFor all the latest Technology News, download Indian Express App\n\u00a9 IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"}

Granny or Uncle Colin would be behind me, telling me to go steady and watch the head, catching the pump as it lurched back, putting a hand under the glass just in case.\nI was better at dropping lemon quarters in an inch of gin, its fierce juniper scent making my nose twitch. I was better still at impaling cocktail cherries on toothpicks for Babysham, or my own tame snowball, which I would drink sitting up at the bar with my brother, wreathed in cigarette smoke, legs swinging from the high stool in time to songs we didn\u2019t really understand: \u201cIf you want my body, and you think I\u2019m sexy, come on sugar let me know...\u201d\nA good slice of my childhood was spent at my granny\u2019s pub, The Gardeners Arms: a large, red-brick Robinson\u2019s pub at the bottom of Durham street in Oldham, in Greater Manchester. For years it had been a troubled local, a succession of landlords who hadn\u2019t settled in, giving the brewery a real headache, but then Alice came along. She was quite a woman, Alice Jones.\nAt first glance she seemed delicate, dainty even, but she wasn\u2019t. Born in Manchester, the youngest of five girls, Alice was brought up by her sisters after her father died from war injuries and her mother went back to work. She was strong and hardworking, with a capacity to clean, the likes of which I have never seen since. She had also spent her 20s working in the accounts office at Kellogg\u2019s and reading books and papers. This combination of hardworking hands, a head for accounts and knowledge, along with creamy Lancome beauty and charm, made her quite the landlady.\nI remember her both in her housecoat buffing the brass tables and flushing out the pipes \u2013 good bitter comes from a clean cellar and clean pipes \u2013 then, later, when regulars had taken their place, coming down the stairs ready for the night. \u201cYou look a million dollars Al,\u201d my grandpa Gerry would say, Bob Seger curling out of the juke box in agreement: \u201cShe was looking so right, in her diamonds and frills...\u201d\nBy the time we three grandkids arrived in the 1970s, you were safe in The Gardeners Arms, the convivial heart of that part of town. It was regulars only and everybody knew everyone\u2019s name, game \u2013 darts, billiards, cribbage or chat \u2013 drink and business.\nAlice had also started serving food, her sister May at the stove. May was even smaller and tougher than Alice: I remember her frying, shouting at my uncle Frank or cracking her 30-a-day laugh. May\u2019s specialty was \u201csteak Canadian\u201d \u2013 a strip of steak, flash fried with onions stuffed in large white rolls called oven-bottom cakes. There were also bacon or tongue sandwiches; and pies: meat and potato or cheese and onion \u2013 both served with peas.\nOn Sunday, once the pub had closed after the lunch service and the last customers swayed away, bottles clinking in their pockets, we would push the brass tables together and lay for our Sunday lunch, a roast and all the trimmings on the side, a tangle of family relations, and as many coins as we wanted for the jukebox.\nLater, when she left the pub, Alice continued to make pie and peas. She was an inveterately particular and good pastry maker, and it is her voice, specific and firm, I hear when I make pastry: \u201cYou want cold hands. Run them under cold tap, then work quickly, rubbing until it looks like breadcrumbs, and use iced water.\u201d\nRachel Roddy\u2019s recipes for three winter salads Read more\nI miss her voice, with its soft Manchester lilt. It is the same lilt I hear and love in Simon Hopkinson\u2019s writing: his stories and recipes from his Lancashire mum; familiar, and therefore comforting. His recipes are also full of common sense and good taste, so unbeatable. Today\u2019s is his recipe.\nCheese and onion pie is just that: cheese and onion \u2013 nothing more, nothing less. It is a straightforward, smashing pie, a soft filling encased in short, crumbling pastry, meaning you need to chase the last few crumbs amount the plate with a finger tip. I find all lard pastry a bit hard to handle, and so prefer half-lard, half-butter, which makes for a short, but manageable pastry.\nYou start the white onions in butter then add a cup of water, which creates a steamy braise. Once all the water has been driven away by cooking, and the onions are soft, they are ready. The cheese should be Lancashire: its fluffy texture, creamy flavour and the fact that it melts, but doesn\u2019t pull into strings, make it ideal.\nIt is is near impossible to find Lancashire cheese in Rome, so I made do with a mix of young pecorino and caciocavallo, which worked well enough. Make sure you seal the edges of the pie well, pinching and pressing. After baking, let the pie rest before turning it out of the tin, otherwise you might have a mishap.\nCheese and onion pie cries out for a dab of English mustard or piccalilli. I had neither. I am not sure what Auntie May would have said about the frilly-edged tin or pink radicchio \u2013 plenty I imagine.

Make the pastry by rubbing the fat into the flour with your fingertips, or pulsing with a food processor, until the mix resembles breadcrumbs. Add a pinch of salt and enough iced water \u2013 gradually and cautiously \u2013 to make a ball of dough, neither too sticky, nor too firm. Wrap the dough in clingfilm and chill for at least 30 minutes.\n2 Peel, half and slice the onion into half moons. In a frying pan, melt the butter over a low flame, then add the onions and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring for a few minutes. Add a small glass of water and then cook, stirring occasionally, for about 15 minutes until the water has been driven away and the onion is very soft. Remove from the heat and allow to cool. Grate the cheese.\n3 Preheat the oven to 180C\/350F\/gas mark 4. Roll out \u2154 of the pastry and use it to line the base and sides of the tin, so it overhangs slightly. Do not trim yet, but prick the base with a fork. Make a layer with half the onion, grind over a little black pepper, then make a layer using half the cheese. Repeat. Paint the edges of the dough with milk. Roll the remaining dough into a circle a little larger than the tin, lay it over the filling and then press it firmly into the edges. Trim the excess dough away. Make three short slashes in the middle of the pie to let steam escape. If you you like, use the non-blade side of a knife to make a faint lattice.\n4 Sit the pie on a preheated baking sheet and bake for 40-50 minutes, or until golden and the cheese is bubbling gently through the slashes. Allow the pie to sit for 30 minutes before turning it out."}

To identify those chemicals, they use infrared (IR) sensors and spectroscopy, which allow a specific color of light to shine at a particular frequency corresponding to each chemical. Identifying each chemical will require a soldier to coat the goggle with a unique filter, enabling the chemical signature to come through at a specific frequency (i.e., a specific color).\nResearchers at the University of Illinois, however, have successfully developed a tunable infrared filter made from graphene, which would allow a solider to change the frequency of a filter simply by controlled mechanical deformation of the filter (i.e., graphene origami), and not by replacing the substance on the goggles used to filter a particular spectrum of colors.\nThe research is funded by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, which is interested in sensors that are not only sensitive to different IR wavelengths, but also mechanically controllable and tunable. The results are published in a paper titled \"Mechanically Reconfigurable Architectured Graphene for Tunable Plasmonic Resonances\" in Light: Science & Applications.\nThis application is another in a series of discoveries of \"wonder material\" graphene by SungWoo Nam, an Assistant Professor of Mechanical Science and Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\"Typically when you place graphene on a substrate, it is extremely transparent and absorbs only about three percent of light,\" Nam noted. \"At certain angles, you can see it. We use this versatility to make other structures like flexible and transparent sensors out of graphene.\"\nBecause it's one-atom thin, graphene is normally used while flat. Nam's research team asked a question: what would happen if through origami (paper-folding art), you wrinkled the graphene? Could you change the properties of graphene by altering its topography?\nAccording to Nam, scientists haven't tried this idea before with other conventional materials because they are brittle and not able to be bent without breaking. What's unique about graphene is that it is not only thin, but it is resilient, meaning it doesn't break easily when it is bent.\n\"Let's say we create graphene wrinkles by mechanical deformation,\" Nam said. \"If you get a certain dimension, is there going be any changes in the way the light is going to be absorbed by the graphene? We wanted to link the dimensions of the wrinkled graphene to its optical absorption.\"\nNam's team discovered that indeed, wrinkled graphene absorbs light differently depending on the structure and dimensions through plasmonic resonances, thus producing different colors. In addition, unlike paper, which can't easily be flattened after folding or crumpling, graphene can be re-stretched to become flat and wrinkle free again. Not only that but the amount of light absorption can be altered by a factor of approximately 10.\n\"By changing the shape, you can absorb the light of a different frequency by controlling plasmonic resonance conditions,\" Pilgyu Kang, the first author of the paper and now an Assistant Professor at Mechanical Engineering Department at George Mason University, stated. \"And by mechanically controlling the height and wavelength of the graphene wrinkles, I can excite different surface plasmons and thus absorb different frequency. At the end of the day, you get a tunable filter.\"\nBy choosing graphene as a filter for infrared goggles, the user can turn a knob to mechanically stretch and compress the graphene. That allows for a change of the light wavelength being absorbed. So as an example of its application, a solider can thus easily tune the graphene filter to a desired wavelength to match the type of chemical he\/she is looking for.\n\"In a conventional filter, once you make the filter, you are done,\" Nam concluded. \"No matter the size, there is one unique light wavelength. With graphene, depending on how much you stretch and release, you can communicate in different light wavelengths.\"\n###\nThis work is based on an international collaboration with Dr. Kyoung-Ho Kim and Professor Hong-Gyu Park at Korea University, and is supported by the AFOSR and National Science Foundation."}

In addition to reportedly causing a decline in morale, employees to openly cry and associates to seek employment elsewhere or quit outright, OTS is said to have led to food shortages across stores.\nWhole Foods instructs store managers to walk through store aisles and storage rooms regularly with checklists called \u201cscorecards,\u201d making sure every item is in its appropriate place, BI reported. If managers find anything amiss, they dock points, and employees are quizzed on the spot regarding sales goals, top-selling items, the prior week's sales and more. Scores below 89.9 percent can result in firings.\nWhole Foods' decentralized approach prior to its purchase by Amazon was complex and costly, Jim Holbrook, CEO of Stamford, Conn.-based consultancy Daymon, a partner of Whole Foods, told BI. The old system gave buyers at store and regional levels more power to decide what to put on shelves, while OTS brings more of the decision-making to Whole Foods' corporate office in Austin, Texas.\nOTS has reportedly helped cut costs, reduce shrink, clear storage and allow more employee-customer engagement, BI stated, and a spokesperson told the news site that \u201cteam members are really excited about\u201d the system. But labor cuts and what appears to be insufficient training reportedly have left employees confused by and working longer hours to deal with OTS.\nWhole Foods' introduction of OTS to its stores follows reports made at the time of the acquisition that Amazon and the grocer's technology teams have plans to invest over time in various areas, including merchandising and logistics, to enable lower prices for Whole Foods customers.\nThis is not the first time people working with or for Whole Foods have complained about changes since Amazon's purchase of the chain. For instance, as Amazon seeks to lower prices at Whole Foods, it has placed limits on how products are sold in stores and asking suppliers to help foot the charges, thus upsetting smaller brands, which had an easier time getting into and staying in Whole Foods stores."}

Should we switch to non-aluminium pots and pans?\nJim Taylor, Plymouth.\nThe possibility of a link between aluminium and Alzheimer\u2019s has been the subject of research and debate for years.\nSuspicion began as long ago as 1921, when an association between aluminium poisoning and memory problems was first noted.\nWe all have some aluminium in our brains (it doesn\u2019t occur naturally, but can get there via the foods we eat or be absorbed through the skin when we\u2019re exposed to it), and it builds up with age.\nThe possibility of a link between aluminium and Alzheimer\u2019s has been the subject of research and debate for years. Suspicion began as long ago as 1921, when an association between aluminium poisoning and memory problems was first noted\nBrain scans from post-mortem examinations of Alzheimer\u2019s patients have shown there is an accumulation of aluminium in the brain. And patients with a genetic susceptibility to early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s have been found to have even more.\nAlso, in patients on dialysis for kidney disease, a condition called dialysis encephalopathy can develop, which leads to a type of dementia \u2014 one cause of this encephalopathy is damage caused by an accumulation of aluminium in the brain.\nHowever, none of these cases prove a causal link, just that there is an association.\nThe main risk factor for Alzheimer\u2019s disease is age \u2014 and aluminium aggregates in brain tissue with age, so these events may just be occurring in parallel.\nThe reason people have pointed to aluminium cookware as a potential problem is that certain acids in foods will dissolve some of the metal and form chemical salts which will then be absorbed into the body.\nWhen these get into nerve tissue, such as in the brain, they can accumulate. Aluminium ions (charged particles) are known to be neurotoxic, meaning they can poison the brain and nervous system. However, once again, the risk posed by aluminium cookware has not been proven.\nFurthermore, the view is that it would be difficult to significantly reduce the amount of aluminium we absorb by simply avoiding the use of aluminium cookware or foil for food wrapping, because it can still get into the body from other sources, such as processed foods, tea, wine, fizzy drinks, cosmetics and medicines such as aspirin (this may be because of the way they are produced or stored).\nOur body removes most of the aluminium as waste, but a theory is that if we absorb large amounts, then it is deposited in tissues.\nIn particular, black tea \u2014 which is the leaf of a small, evergreen shrub, a variety of Camellia \u2014 as it grows, accumulates large amounts of aluminium.\nYet there is no evidence that people who drink a lot of tea have a higher incidence of dementia. And no one has suggested that we all stop drinking tea. I am not convinced there\u2019s a risk. If you are particularly concerned, or know you are at risk of Alzheimer\u2019s, you may be reassured if you switch to stainless steel cookware, which is cheap and widely available.\nBut bear in mind you can\u2019t avoid aluminium completely.\nI have a large hiatus hernia and it causes a lot of discomfort, making me feel sick and as if I\u2019ve been punched in the stomach. Can you suggest anything to alleviate this? I am 83.\nE. Macdonald, Watford.\nA hiatus hernia occurs when part of the stomach squeezes into the chest through an opening in the diaphragm, the domed wall of muscle that sits across the chest and separates the gullet from the stomach (the gullet passes through the diaphragm in an opening called the hiatus, and connects to the stomach on the other side).\nBy the way... I'm worried about the lack of radiologists Most people have little more than a hazy idea of what radiologists do \u2014 but there is hardly a nook or cranny in medical care that does not depend upon their skills. Gone are the days when these doctors were just stuck in a darkened room reading X-rays: now, they are skilled in ultrasound and MRI techniques, perform procedures such as biopsies and treating blocked blood vessels and play a vital role in the diagnosis of many conditions. Sadly \u2014 much as I have been saying about general practice \u2014 there is a pressing crisis in the service. A study last year by The Royal College of Radiologists confirmed one in ten consultant radiologist posts is vacant, and more than 60 per cent have remained unfilled for a year. Worse still, 22 per cent of radiologists are predicted to retire in the next five years, yet we\u2019re not training enough to replace them \u2014 even when we already have a shortage of radiologists and thousands of scans and X-rays are waiting more than a month to be analysed. Once again, the root of the problem lies in poor planning and political short-termism. The solution? The Government must fund training in radiology and make the specialty more attractive \u2014 fast. Applying tighter financial stringency and bureaucracy by rearranging the deckchairs as usual will not cut it. But is there light at the end of the tunnel? The Government\u2019s recent Cancer Workforce Plan sets out ambitions to enhance diagnosis and treatment by investing in technology and equipment, and it recognises that without sufficient trained staff \u2014 radiologists, radiographers and nurses \u2014 none of that can be used effectively. The plans include a pledge to increase the number of radiologists by around 300. But there is no new money for this, only a shuffling of priorities originally set out in a spending review in 2016 \u2014 in other words, we will have to rob Peter to pay Paul. What was I saying about deckchairs?\nThis part of the diaphragm acts as a valve to prevent the stomach contents rising up.\nBut when this muscle weakens, as a result of ageing, obesity or anything else, the valve action fails, a gap opens up and the stomach itself pushes through the widened space and into the chest area.\nIn most cases, hiatus hernias do not cause symptoms and won\u2019t need treatment.\nHowever, patients with large hiatus hernias \u2014 where the stomach plus gullet move up into the chest \u2014 may have symptoms of heartburn, such as a sense of regurgitation, an acid taste in the throat, trouble swallowing, a cough, or nausea, just as you describe in your longer letter.\nTreatment for hiatus hernia involves medicines that help reduce acid reflux to ease the symptoms.\nThis includes antacids to neutralise the acid or medicines such as ranitidine which suppress acid production \u2014 both are available on prescription, as well as over-the-counter.\nMore powerful is a prescription-only medication called a proton pump inhibitor, such as high-dose omeprazole. Ask your GP about a prescription for one of these medicines, if it has not been done already.\nIf these don\u2019t work, you may need surgery to fix the hernia, although this involves a major operation and is a last resort.\nDo bear in mind that some simple lifestyle changes can be helpful.\nThese include not eating large meals in the evening, eating slowly and going for a short walk after each meal.\nIf your symptoms persist despite acid suppressant treatment and taking great care, as above, further investigations may be necessary.\nDiscuss again with your GP and consider a referral to a specialist gastroenterologist as your symptoms have persisted and are so troublesome.\nWrite to Dr Scurr at Good Health, Daily Mail, 2 Derry Street, London W8 5TT or email drmartin@dailymail.co.uk \u2014 include your contact details. Dr Scurr cannot enter into personal correspondence.\nReplies should be taken in a general context and always consult your own GP with any health worries."}

The market features vendors that have gained expertise in specific technologies, and are operating with cutting edge specialization in their production capacities. Leading names in the industry are Dow Chemicals, BASF and DuPont. Some other prominent players such as Teva, Sun Pharma, Cipla, Takeda, and Orchid Pharma, are seen expanding their business to emerging economies in the Asia Pacific such as India.\nRequest for the Sample Report @ https:\/\/www.transparencymarketresearch.com\/sample\/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=1690\nVendors are expected to face the challenge of application of sophisticated technologies and gaining long-term contracts with international manufacturers, leading to optimized scale of economies. Manufacturers have been producing their own drugs to gain substantial profit margins and explore the pharmaceutical landscape better. The vendor landscape of the global active pharmaceutical ingredients market is moderately consolidated at the present. Due to stringency in quality checks and regulations, new players are hard-pressed to enter the market.\nAccording to TMR\u2019s report, the global active pharmaceuticals market is predicted to rise at a 6.4% CAGR over the forecast period from 2017 to 2023. The market stood at US$151,591.7 in 2017, and is predicted to attain US$219,601.9 by 2023.\nThe global API market has witnessed tremendous growth over the last few decades owing to the increased use of drugs and biologics in the treatment of diseases. The increasing adoption of quality standards in API manufacturing such as Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), current GMP (cGMP), and the global adoption of International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines, have helped improve the safety standards. On the other hand, the API industry is facing the challenges such as, shortening the development time, reducing the cost of development, improving the process design and meeting the quality standard without compromising on the profitability. The global API market is likely to be impacted by a large number of innovative drugs going off patent in the recent years.\nRequest for Discount @ https:\/\/www.transparencymarketresearch.com\/sample\/sample.php?flag=D&rep_id=1690\nRising use of specialty medicines is anticipated to grow the pharmaceutical spending worldwide with quicker growth in richer, developed nations as compared to their emerging counterparts. This is primarily because the former have adequate manufacturing units, a higher spending power, and greater emphasis on transparent pricing by assessing measuring effects on the population.\nGeneric drugs benefit from the patent expiration of innovative drug as it makes them readily available in the market. The demand to produce quality medicines at lower and affordable costs creates a scenario, where the needs for generic drugs increase. It has been estimated that generic drugs save approximately USD 3 billion every week in the United States. In 2013, unbranded generic drugs accounted for more than 80% of the prescription drugs being distributed, primarily due to their low price for patients, payers, and the healthcare system. Therefore, the rise in the demand for generic drugs is expected to be one of the major drivers for the API market.\nOther factors playing a vital role for the growth of this market include the rise in the geriatric population with an increase in chronic and lifestyles related disorders, technological advancements in the process of API manufacture, and rising preference for targeted therapy approach in cancer treatment.\nRequest for Report TOC @ https:\/\/www.transparencymarketresearch.com\/report-toc\/1690\nAbout Us\nTransparency Market Research is a global market intelligence company, providing global business information reports and services.

He is especially grateful to the hardworking rank-and-file public servants who work every day to keep America safe and uphold our laws while protecting the constitutional rights of all Americans,\u201d Sanders said.\nNoting that minority members of the Committee have reportedly drafted a separate memorandum, Sanders said the administration stands ready to work with Congress to accommodate oversight requests consistent with applicable standards, including the need to protect intelligence sources and methods.\nTrump called the memo\u2019s contents \u201ca disgrace\u201d.\n\u201cA lot of people should be ashamed of themselves,\u201d he said following the memo\u2019s declassification.\nComing out in Trump\u2019s defense, Congressman Dana Rohrabacher said the memo \u201chighlights a truth\u201d.\n\u201cThe integrity of even our law enforcement and intelligence agencies can be politicized and compromised. From time-to-time, we all must be reminded of that vulnerability.\nThat is why we must insist on congressional oversight of all federal agencies, especially of our foreign and domestic intelligence services,\u201d he said.\nRohrabacher commended Trump for \u201cstanding up for transparency\u201d and alleged that the Democrats tried to thwart the inquiry.\n\u201cThis was nothing less than an attempted cover-up of wrongdoing by the last administration. This whole episode makes Watergate pale in comparison,\u201d he said.\nPublicly, the FBI said nothing, but Director Christopher Wray sent out a video and written statement to employees, urging them not to get distracted by the debate raging about them.\n\u201cThe American people read the papers, and they hear lots of talk on cable TV and social media. But they see and experience the actual work you do keeping communities safe and our nation secure, often dealing with sensitive matters and making decisions under difficult circumstances,\u201d Wray said.\n\u201cAnd that work will always matter more. Talk is cheap; the work you do is what will endure.\u201d\nIt is unclear whether Trump will use the memo to fire people involved in the Russia probe, including Deputy Attorney General Rod J Rosenstein, who oversees it.\nDemocrats warned against any dismissals at the Justice Department, saying such moves would trigger a constitutional crisis.\nFormer FBI Director James Comey, who was abruptly fired by Trump last year for his handling of the Russia inquiry, criticized the memo.\n\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Comey said on Twitter.\n\u201cDishonest and misleading memo wrecked the House intel committee, destroyed trust with Intelligence Community, damaged relationship with FISA court, and inexcusably exposed classified investigation of an American citizen. For what?\u201d Comey wrote, adding: \u201cDOJ & FBI must keep doing their jobs.\u201d\nSince he was fired, Comey has increasingly taken to Twitter to support the FBI and other intelligence agencies.-PTI\nComments\ncomments"}

Law enforcement has been planning security for Sunday's spectacle for two years.\nScroll for more content...\n\"I think we have done our best to think of just about every contingency, natural or man-made,\" said Minneapolis police Cmdr. Scott Gerlicher, overall public safety coordinator for Super Bowl LII. \"The Super Bowl is just a massive operation and very complicated.\"\nThe Minneapolis Police Department is the lead agency for security. But the department of about 840 sworn officers will get help from dozens of law enforcement agencies -- federal, state and local -- because it is simply not big enough to handle the huge undertaking.\n\"Coordination at all levels is key,\" said Alex Khu, St. Paul special agent in charge for Homeland Security Investigations and federal coordinator for Super Bowl security. \"There are so many moving pieces. No one agency can do this alone.\"\nPrescreening hours before game time\nThe venue, US Bank Stadium, is smack in the middle of downtown Minneapolis around businesses, residences and public transportation, the FBI said, noting the security challenges.\nEvents leading up to Sunday's game near the stadium have made establishing the perimeter and security zones \"significantly more complicated,\" according to Richard T. Thornton, special agent in charge of the FBI's Minneapolis division. These include this week's Super Bowl Experience at the Minneapolis Convention Center.\nThere will be a bulked-up police presence with officers in tactical gear, bomb-sniffing dogs, choppers and fencing in and around the indoor fixed-roof stadium, which is home of the Minnesota Vikings.\nCoping with the brutal cold has been a factor in coordinating event planning and security. The temperature outside the stadium is forecast to be around 3 degrees Fahrenheit at game time at 5:30 p.m. (6:30 p.m. ET).\nThe FBI said attendees will be prescreened at indoor locations, such as the Mall of America in Bloomington more than 11 miles from the venue, \"so they won't have to wait outside the stadium.\"\nSuch prescreening at other locations \"is a first for the NFL and the security plan,\" said Joseph Rivers, an assistant special agent in charge in the FBI's Minneapolis division.\nScreening procedures will begin at the stadium more than four hours before the game, with authorities setting out an extensive list of what is allowed to be carried into the stadium and what is prohibited, the NFL said.\n\"To provide a safe environment and to expedite fan entry into the stadium, the NFL limits the size and type of bags that may be brought into the stadium. All items carried by spectators will be carefully inspected and potentially not permitted into the stadium,\" a statement said.\nCountering terror\nAs at every Super Bowl, the FBI is the lead agency for counterterrorism efforts in the runup to and during the game.\nIt is making threat assessments for the Super Bowl by analyzing attacks at mass events, such as the May bombing at the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, and the mass shooting in Las Vegas in October.\n\"We are facilitating the name checks and records checks for all the folks who are going to get credentialed,\" Rivers said. \"That means volunteers, food vendors, private security people -- the number of individuals could exceed 30,000. That's a huge commitment from our office.\"\nThe Minneapolis-St. Paul region has unique concerns over the years -- the stabbing at a mall, the bombing of a mosque and fears over the influence of Somalia's Al-Shabaab, an Islamist movement in that African nation, on the large local Somali population.\n\"We actually bring experience -- some continuity and background -- to the planning cycle, which we're obviously willing to share, and that we work with our state and local partners on to transfer some of that knowledge and hopefully shortcut some of the planning process,\" Rivers said.\nThe US Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations also is on hand to be on the alert of \"the illegal manufacturing and sale of counterfeit goods\" such as sports apparel.\nNational Guard called up\nGov. Mark Dayton has authorized the National Guard to provide security, with more than 400 Minnesota National Guardsmen called up.\n\"This is what we do,\" said Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen, adjutant general of the Minnesota National Guard. \"When the local community can't meet the public safety needs, they come to the Guard. We're their normal partner, we're a natural partner, and we're their preferred partner when it comes to filling in the gaps that they can't fill.\"\nThornton called the effort \"herculean.\" He said the goal is \"making sure that it is not only a safe event for everyone that attends and participates, but that it's an enjoyable event for them as well.\""}

No one is ever going to stand outside your workplace with a clipboard, totting up your journeys \u2013 but you can\u2019t buy items clearly not used for this purpose \u2013 such as full-face helmets. There\u2019s nothing stopping you buying a time trial bike or new road race bike though.\nRide to Work, Evans Cycles\u2019 scheme provider, tells us the average spend is \u00a3800 \u2013 a figure it says is \u201ca slight increase from recent years [due to] the cost of bikes rising due to inflation and exchange rate fluctuations.\u201d\nIn 2010, changes were made to the \u2018fair market value\u2019, which could have rendered the scheme less useful. However, it is still widely used and, according to national cycling charity Cycling UK, very worth it.\nSam Jones at Cycling UK told us: \u201cWe\u2019re absolutely pro the Cycle to Work scheme \u2013 you make a saving, it helps people spread the cost out over time, and it helps employers and employees think about cycling.\n>>> The benefits of cycling\n\u201cMy gut feeling is that it has helped people think about riding to work. Recent UK stats show that in the years between 2006 and 2016, whilst there\u2019s less trips being made, there\u2019s been an increase in distance.\n\u201cThe type of riding that\u2019s increased is leisure and commuting. Is that down to the Cycle to Work scheme? I doubt it. But it\u2019s probably had some sort of impact. Particularly in cities where they\u2019ve actively been trying to promote cycling, like Cambridge or London, Bristol. Where people can see this as getting themselves a decent bike that they can use to commute, and for leisure,\u201d he added.\nCommenting on the scheme\u2019s place in the landscape of the cycling industry today, a representative from Evans Cycles\u2019 scheme provider Ride to Work told us: \u201cIt is the most affordable way to get a bike and, or, cycling equipment, allowing you to get both a reduced cost, and to spread the payments. It\u2019s like zero per cent finance, but better.\n\u201cLikewise with Evans Cycles you can double this up with sale items too. Finally, don\u2019t forget that each time an employee joins a cycle to work scheme, employers reduce their own National Insurance Contributions too.\u201d\nHere\u2019s the \u2018what is it\u2019, \u2018what if I leave\u2019, \u2018how do I enrol\u2019 and \u2018why should I\u2019 of the Cycle to Work scheme\u2026\nWhat is the cycle to work scheme?\nThe Cycle to Work scheme lets you spend up to \u00a31000 on a bike and equipment \u2013 paying it off over the next year in monthly instalments.\n>>> Top tips for commuting to work by bike\nIn theory, this is the \u2018hire period\u2019. After this, your company is technically allowed to take the bike back, or you can purchase it for \u2018fair market value\u2019 \u2013 which can be up to 25 per cent of the original value. In practice, there are several other (cheaper) options.\nThe saving is created by the fact that the payments are except from tax \u2013 hence the \u2018up to 42 per cent\u2019 saving. Of course, how much you save depends upon the tax bracket you sit in \u2013 higher rate earners will save more.\nRegardless how much cash you save, you\u2019re always going to be getting an interest free loan \u2013 which is a plus for anyone.\nCan anyone get a bike on the Cycle to Work scheme?\nTo get a bike on the scheme, your employer needs to sign up to a provider \u2013 such as the Cycle Scheme or Evans Cycles\u2019 Ride to Work scheme.\nIf you\u2019re self-employed, you can make use of the scheme if you\u2019re set up in a way which means you\u2019re technically employed by your own limited company. Alternatively, you can buy the bike and claim the VAT back via the business.\nThe scheme is only available for those over 18-years-old, and you can\u2019t make use of it if doig so would make your gross pay drop below the minimum wage.\nCycle to Work scheme savings calculator\nMonthly salary sacrifice \u00a383.33 Savings per month \u00a326.66 Savings per year \u00a3320 Total payment towards \u00a31,000 bike \u00a3680\nLooking at one individual example, if you\u2019re a standard rate tax payer, and you take out \u00a31000 worth of equipment, your monthly salary sacrifice (payment) will be \u00a383.33. Your savings vary depending upon your tax bracket.\n>>> What\u2019s the best bike for commuting?\nIf your gross salary each month was \u00a32000 you would normally pay \u00a3640 in combined Income Tax (20 per cent) and NIC (12 per cent).\nHowever, with the \u00a383.33 salary sacrifice taken into account your monthly tax\/NIC burden is only \u00a3613.34. That means each month you save \u00a326.66.\nOver the year you\u2019ll save around \u00a3320 (or 32 per cent of \u00a31000 \u2014 it\u2019s obvious enough, that\u2019s your combined Income Tax and NIC rate) and pay only \u00a3680 towards your \u00a31000 cycling equipment.\nAnd that works across the board \u2014 if your total Cycle to Work outlay is \u00a3800 you will save 32 per cent on that, so you\u2019ll only pay \u00a3544 over the year.\nWhat happens at the end of the loan term?\nSo far our calculations haven\u2019t factored in the end-of-term \u2018fair market value\u2019 if you want to buy the bike outright \u2014 throughout the \u2018hire\u2019 term of the Cycle to Work deal your employers own your bike and any kit you bought. Though it\u2019s questionable if they\u2019ll ever want your smelly shoes, or the backpack you spilled the contents of your lunchbox in, back.\nHere\u2019s a table explaining what the tax folk at HMRC require you pay if you want to take ownership:\nAge of equipment Original price \u00a3500 12 months 18 per cent 25 per cent 18 months 16 per cent 21 per cent 2 years 13 per cent 17 per cent 3 years 8 per cent 12 per cent 4 years 3 per cent 7 per cent\nSo if we go back to our \u00a31000 bike, even in the least financially efficient scenario where you buy the bike straight after the 12-month loan period, it would cost you \u00a3680 of salary sacrifice and then \u00a3250 final market price, giving you a total of \u00a3930, saving you at absolute minimum seven per cent.\n>>> Essential commuting clothes for cycling to work\nScheme providers have also come up with way of reducing the final payment, by allowing the employee to continue to lease the bike, to a point where the payment is negligible.\nThe Cycle Scheme, for example, lets you pay a small refundable deposit to keep the bike for a further three years, after which it becomes yours for no extra cost (and during which you can change jobs and enrol in a new scheme).\nThe Ride to Work scheme, offered by Evans Cycles, provides a similar service \u2013 it recommends you use its Tranfer For You scheme where you\u2019ll stay in the scheme for a further 48 or 60 months, free of charge. After this, the bike belongs to you. You can instead opt to take ownership immediately, but you\u2019ll then need to pay the Fair Market Value rate.\nA representative from the scheme at Evans Cycles told us: \u201cWith Ride-to-Work the most popular option is to enter a free of charge extended use agreement called Transfer For You. Other options include paying 18 to 25 per cent FMV [fair market value] at the end of the first 12 months, opting to declare it as a Benefit in Kind via P11D, or the final and rare occurrence is some people choose to return the bike to the scheme provider.\u201d\nLock your bike securely, and do insure it\nCycling UK made a good point when we spoke to them. Jones told us: \u201cWe\u2019d always advise insuring the bike \u2013 during the period of the loan [the bike] is the responsibility of the employee \u2013 so if it is pinched then you still have to continue paying out.\u201d\nWho are Cycle to Work providers and which retailers accept which vouchers?\nThere are a number of different Cycle to Work providers. It\u2019s up to your employer which one they enrol in, and that will impact your choice of bike shop and thus brand.\nHere\u2019s a look at which retailers use which schemes:\nEvans Cycles \u2013 Ride to Work (Evans Cycles own brand), CyclesScheme, Bike2Work Scheme, CyclePlus, Vivup\n\u2013 Ride to Work (Evans Cycles own brand), CyclesScheme, Bike2Work Scheme, CyclePlus, Vivup Halfords Cycles\/Cycle Republic \u2013 Cycle2Work (Halford\u2019s own brand).\n\u2013 Cycle2Work (Halford\u2019s own brand).

Wiggle \u2013 Wiggle Cycle to Work, CycleScheme, Bike2WorkScheme, CyclePlus and Gemelli\n\u2013 Wiggle Cycle to Work, CycleScheme, Bike2WorkScheme, CyclePlus and Gemelli Chain Reaction Cycles \u2013 CycleScheme and Chain Reaction Cycle\u2019s Ride 2 Work.\nI want to enrol in the Cycle to Work scheme \u2013 what should I do first?\nCycle to Work scheme practices vary. But the most common process looks like this:\nFind out what scheme your employer is enrolled in, therefore where you can buy your bike from, and do some window shopping\nSpeak to your HR department and request a certificate\nReceive the certificate, take it to the relevant bike shop\nRedeem the certificate against the cost of bike and equipment\nSalary sacrifice commences from your next pay packet\nWhat happens if I leave my job during the hire?\nThere comes a time when every fish must move to a new pond. Or something like that. People leave workplaces for many reasons \u2013 so what happens then?\nThe employer is perfectly in their right to take the bike back, and use if for other employees as a \u2018pool bike\u2019 \u2013 but this is pretty unlikely. In most cases, both the soon-to-be-ex-employee and likewise-employer want the afore mentioned to keep the bike.\nIn this case, the employer will deduct the remaining balance from the final salary. Whether they charge the fair market value on top is up to them. Following this payment, the bike belongs to the former employee.\nExplaining the options, Evans Cycles\u2019 representative told us: \u201cIf you leave your employer before you have completed the salary sacrifice term, any balance remaining must be repaid from your final net salary, i.e. without tax or NI savings. To take ownership of the bike a transfer of ownership process will also apply within the HMRC Fair Market Valuation guidelines. Your employer will be able to advise which transfer option would apply to you.\u201d\nJones said: \u201cIf you were concerned at all, you can just say to the employer \u2018I don\u2019t want to keep it\u2019, give it back to them and you won\u2019t have to pay.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also reasonable to ask if your pension or other benefits could be affected by opting in to the scheme. The Cyclescheme explains \u201cpensionable earnings are calculated on your gross pay before any salary sacrifice you may have in place.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the kind of thing worth running by someone on your side though, Evans Cycles told us: \u201cGenerally, the scheme doesn\u2019t affect final salary pensions or other benefits but it\u2019s always best to check with HR or Payroll in advance.\u201d"}

According to Deveney, they\u2019d likely need to part with either Jaylen Brown or Terry Rozier, as well as their No. 27 pick in this year\u2019s draft and at least one of their 2019 selections. Boston currently owns the Sacramento Kings\u2019 first-round pick (protected for the No. 1 overall pick) and the Memphis Grizzlies\u2019 first-rounder, which is top-8 protected.\nParting ways with the 21-year-old Brown, who more than doubled his scoring output during his second NBA season while blossoming into a legitimate, two-way NBA starter, seems like a steep price to pay for the C\u2019s. But the possibility of trading Rozier is intriguing: If Boston re-signs restricted free agent Marcus Smart, the 24-year-old point guard could be the odd man out in a crowded backcourt with Kyrie Irving returning to the fold.\nThe Celtics also may need an interior presence with Aron Baynes and Greg Monroe hitting free agency. Bamba\u2019s 7-foot-10 wingspan is the longest ever recorded at the NBA combine, and he averaged a double-double (12.9 points, 10.4 rebounds per game) while blocking 3.7 shots per game during his only season with the Longhorns."}

But in this crowd that wants it most of all, there was no sense of triumph.\nPremier Rachel Notley tried to whip up enthusiasm after Morneau finished his very short talk (18 minutes, a new indoor record for political brevity.)\nThe cheerleading fell a bit flat, even though Notley herself was well-received.\nAt one point, a lone protester made her way in and started shouting anti-pipeline slogans. She was gently escorted out amid boos that never gained much traction.\nFor a crowd of 500 that paid a minimum of $99 per ticket to hear about a mammoth federal energy investment, this bunch was as flat as yesterday\u2019s champagne.\nThe morning-after view of Ottawa\u2019s pipeline purchase is that only one concrete thing has changed.\nKinder Morgan had stopped building, citing political uncertainty. Now, Ottawa tells the company to start building flat-out.\nBut the practical hurdles to getting it done persist, in the courts and on the streets.\nThe Federal Court has yet to rule on challenges to the National Energy Board\u2019s certificate for the pipeline.\nThis is not trivial. Although the pipeline has won 16 straight court rulings, a single adverse one from the Federal Court would be deeply damaging.\nThe challenges are brought by several coastal and Interior B.C. First Nations, including the Tsleil-Waututh, Squamish, Sto:lo, Coldwater, Upper Nicola and Stk\u2019emlupsemc te Secwepemc.\nAlberta and federal officials are exasperated by the court\u2019s leisurely pace in releasing a judgment. First requested last fall, rulings were expected months before now.\nBut they will come. And Ottawa has to pray they\u2019re favourable.\nIt was the Federal Court of Appeal, remember, that began Northern Gateway\u2019s slide to doom by ruling that the Harper government\u2019s consultation with First Nations was deeply inadequate.\nConsultation on the Trans Mountain project has been much more rigorous. But as lawyers know, going to court is like having surgery. There\u2019s always a risk.\nThe other legal worry is the B.C. government\u2019s effort to control bitumen flows within that province. The NDP argues that cross-border shipping is federal business, but once a product is within B.C., the province can regulate all it likes.\nThat argument doesn\u2019t impress some constitutional experts. But if B.C. manages to get this to the Supreme Court and somehow wins, the pipeline would likely become uneconomic.\nThen there\u2019s the protests.\nThe day the deal was announced, thousands marched in Vancouver. Obstruction continues daily on Burnaby Mountain. The purchase deal might already be triggering even more activism.\nTzeporah Berman, who managed to earn $23,000 from the Alberta government before going back to her protest roots, says people feel betrayed by the Trudeau government. She predicts prolonged conflict to rival the Clayoquot Sound logging protests of the 1990s.\n\u201cMy expectation is that the outrage is going to grow, and we\u2019re not just going it see it here in British Columbia but we\u2019re going to see it nationally and internationally,\u201d Berman told The Canadian Press.\nThe earlier anti-logging protests took place in a remote location, she said, but today\u2019s fight is against \u201ca pipeline that runs through urban centres.\u201d\nMorneau was asked after his speech if the government would take a tougher approach to protesters \u2014 perhaps bring in the military.\nHe ducked.\n\u201cKinder Morgan remains responsible for the work . . . It will be appropriate for us to continue with a business-as-usual approach ensuring the safety of everyone on the work sites.\u201d\nDuring his whole speech, and the news conference afterward, Morneau didn\u2019t once mention the B.C. government, Premier John Horgan or the protests.\nAt one point, Morneau chatted amiably with Calgary entrepreneur Brett Wilson, as a couple of reporters stood by.\nWilson suddenly said \u2014 jokingly, I think \u2014 that if protesters are convicted a second time, \u201cyou should send them to Baffin Island for the summer.\u201d\nThe minister smiled and quickly turned away.\nHis real problems may be harder to dodge.\nDon Braid\u2019s column appears regularly in the Herald\ndbraid@postmedia.com\nTwitter: @DonBraid\nFacebook: Don Braid Politics"}

{"id":"648d3b1b-f5cc-4e50-90d5-6b1437cf5b05","text":"HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) \u2014 He was viewed as a likely successor to Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, a longtime ally whose close association with the 93-year-old leader dates to the struggle against white minority rule, Now Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa appears to be falling out of favor, deepening the mystery over who will take over from a man who has ruled since independence in 1980.\nMugabe has led attacks on his old friend, reflecting turmoil within the ruling ZANU-PF party in a country where political uncertainty has fueled problems in a deteriorating economy and increased hardship for many Zimbabweans. The criticism of the vice president, one of two presidential deputies, comes ahead of Mugabe's re-election bid next year and amid a rise in prominence of Defense Minister Sydney Sekeramayi, whose name is popping up more often as a possible successor.\nOn Thursday, Mnangagwa pledged his \"unflinching loyalty\" to Mugabe following accusations from Mugabe's wife, Grace Mugabe, and others that he had misled the country by saying recently that he fell ill because he was poisoned.\nThe fractured opposition, meanwhile, has been unable to channel national discontent into a strong play for power. The main opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, has health problems and recently received treatment in neighboring South Africa.\n\"Mugabe survives on pitting one faction against the other. He elevates one faction, discards it when it begins to feel comfortable and props up another one,\" said Gabriel Shumba, a Zimbabwean political analyst and human rights lawyer based in South Africa.\nThe machinations are eerily similar to those that augured the 2014 dismissal of Vice President Joice Mujuru, another former ally of Mugabe who is now an opposition figure. A dominant figure in the ouster of Mujuru who has now set her sights on Mnangagwa is Zimbabwean first lady Grace Mugabe, whose calls for the appointment of a female vice president intensified talk that she eventually wants to take over the top spot from her husband.\nSo Mnangagwa has dutifully sat through political rallies where the Mugabe couple accused him of leading a faction that seeks power and has endured humiliating barbs from his boss. President Mugabe, for example, told a crowd about allegations that the vice president once left a rival for a woman's affections paralyzed after forcing him to jump from a multi-story building.\n\"He was told to make a choice between sitting on a hot stove or jump out of the window. He chose to jump and now he is disabled. He could have refused both options but I guess he was afraid,\" Mugabe said at a rally in Bindura town on Sept. 9.\nDuring the remarks, Mnangagwa and his wife sat stone-faced on the dais. And that wasn't all. Grace Mugabe then piled on, warning Mnangagwa that he might face a similar fate to that of Mujuru, who was also accused of plotting to oust the president.\n\"I am begging the VP to stop this. I once warned Mujuru and she thought I was joking. Where is she now?\" the first lady thundered.\nThe other vice president, Phelekezela Mphoko, has joined in criticism of his colleague, even though he is not considered a front-runner to succeed Mugabe because he lacks a strong political base.\nZimbabwe's constitution says that if the president dies, resigns or is removed from office, the vice president who last stood in as acting president takes over for 90 days, following which the ruling party must appoint a person who takes over until the expiry of the former president's term. Mnangagwa was acting president during Mugabe's trip to the United Nations last month, while Mphoko has previously assumed the role.\nSome analysts point to Sekeramayi, the low-key defense minister, as a possible successor. A medical doctor, Sekeramayi appears acceptable to those wary of Mnangagwa, who was in charge of state security when Mugabe unleashed a North Korean-trained brigade to crush dissent in western Zimbabwe in the 1980s. Sekeremayi's name was first brought to the fore by Jonathan Moyo, an ally of Grace Mugabe and a critic of a faction associated with Mnangagwa.\nAt the Bindura rally, Mugabe said he invited Mnangagwa and Sekeremayi to join the independence war at around the same time, making neither of them senior to the other. His wife said Mugabe summoned Sekeremayi when he suffered diarrhea and thought he was dying; she didn't say when that happened.\n\"The first family is using the rallies to reconstruct Mnangagwa's image from a war hero to a careless, cruel and divisive individual, unfit to take over. At the same time, he is painting Sekeremayi as equal to Mnangagwa in terms of seniority in the party,\" said Alex Rusero, an analyst based in Harare, the Zimbabwean capital. He speculated: \"All this is to cast Sekeremayi as the chosen one.\""}

Hutchins is, however, obliged to surrender his passport and will be required to wear a tracking device until his trial, which has been scheduled for October.\n\"Marcus Hutchins is a brilliant young man and a hero,\" said Marcia Hofmann, founder of Zeigeist Law, outside the court house. \"He is going to vigorously defend himself against these charges and when the evidence comes to light we are confident that he will be fully vindicated.\"\nThe change in bail conditions is interesting.

That\u2019s the curious question that follows on from reports of Cupertino\u2019s plans to do just that.\nReported yesterday by Ben Lovejoy, the suggestion from multiple sources is that Apple\u2019s triplet of new models (the iPhone X Plus, the updated iPhone X, and a lower priced iPhone SE\/iPhone 8 replacement) would all move to the newer display technology:\n\u2026the original story in South Korea\u2019s Electronic Times cites multiple industry sources, rather than a single one. That in itself is far from definitive, but it gives it more weight than the all-to-common rumors based on a single source. \u2026it lines-up with a much earlier report dating back to before the launch of the iPhone X. This could, of course, be one of the same sources, but it\u2019s again reasonable to take more seriously a suggestion which has remained constant over time.\nWhat this doesn\u2019t take into account is the sheer volume of OLED panels that would be required to make such a move. The lead time alone should be showing up now in the supply chain, or at least be reported as being \u2018on the books\u2019 with the major OLED suppliers. So it\u2019s unlikely that this mix would be going all-in on OLED.\nBut here\u2019s where it gets curious. As fellow Forbes contributor Gordon Kelly argued yesterday, there is a growing suspicion that Apple is looking to push out four models, not three. The iPhone X Plus and the updated iPhone X would be joined by a hybrid iPhone 8\/X which many would consider an SE version of the iPhone X - which would no doubt come with an OLED screen.\nThere are your three OLED screened iPhones for the new season, but with an update to the iPhone SE using an LCD screen urging at the bottom around the $349.You get the all OLED line-up at the top of the portfolio - arguably the portfolio where you earn the big bucks, and you keep the gateway iOS device ticking over with the latest chipsets (which can be manufactured in scale alongside the new top-line machines) while maintaining the perception of a \u2018budget\u2019 smartphone that\u2019s not called such.\nSo, Tim Cook, how do you want to play this? Rationalise the portfolio to the smallest number of handsets, or max out the options at every price point you are comfortably selling at? The former leans heavily into the idea of grabbing as much of the high-end profit, but it sacrifices the potential of bulking up iPhone sales and grabbing back mobile OS market share.\nNow read more about Tim Cook\u2019s chance to pivot the iOS line\u2026"}

This is a real problem at a time when the UK retail sector is under extreme pressure, with high street shops closing every week, falling foul of online competition and high overheads.\nThe latter, however, should escape such scrutiny, focusing on a long-term strategic alliance (3yr operational framework) to cover global suppliers, joint purchasing of own brand products and goods not for sale. Each will continue to work with their own local and national suppliers \u2013 to appease any EU\/domestic criticism no doubt \u2013 but will try to save more where they can in terms of more international procurement. This is essentially the pair bolstering their buying power to save money and protect margins.\nThe question now, in a similar vein to criticism of an SBRY-ASDA tie-up, is whether the consumer will actually benefit from efforts to buy more cheaply. Will prices fall? Will there be more choice? Will the product offering be more competitive?\nThe likelihood is that today\u2019s announcement is focused more on protecting wafer-thin margins than benefiting consumers, knowing that brand loyalty is strong. These are companies after all. And publicly listed. In which case fiduciary duty is to stakeholder\/shareholders, rather than consumers.\nThe timing and geographical proximity of the parties involved, however, is not lost on us as the UK edges closer to what could prove a highly disruptive Brexit. It is highly likely that today\u2019s news is fuelled by fears of what Brexit might do to cross-channel trade and finely tuned supply chains, especially in terms of perishables like fresh food."}

Police were called to the home of Shawn and Brenda Morse in November, and Brenda alleged that her husband \"grabbed her by the throat and threw her to the ground,\" and also tried to smash her phone when she attempted to call 911.\nState Police began an investigation after the incident, at the same time as the Albany Times Union began investigating previous claims of domestic violence committed by Morse.\nWhat did they uncover? In a revealing report on Sunday, the Times Union described patterns of abuse against women Morse dated going back to the 1990s, including:\nA woman he dated for several years told police Morse had grabbed her by the neck and lifted her off the ground during an argument at her apartment.\nA state assemblyman who said he once witnessed Morse walk into a girlfriend's place of work, grab her by the hair and drag her out of the store.\nA Cohoes businesswoman who claimed a friend of hers had been roughed up by Morse multiple times. The friend would not comment on the allegations.\nHow has the community responded? New York State Assemblywoman Patricia Fahy went on Twitter to directly call for Morse's resignation.\nThese are disturbing revelations from the @timesunion about a history of domestic violence and unacceptable behavior not becoming of the title \"Honorable\" from an elected official.

If in fact, the allegations are found to be true, we ask that Mayor Morse resign from office immediately.\"\nCommittee Chairman Jack Flynn also told the Times Union that his party's ethics committee will likely hold its own investigation into the allegations. Flynn stopped short of directly calling for Morse's resignation, saying, \"I will be reserving judgement\" until the State Police investigation is complete.\nMorse has not responded to the allegations, and his attorney, Joseph Ahearn, said, \"the mayor is confident that after a thorough investigation by the State Police, it will be evident that the mayor did not engage in any wrongdoing or criminal conduct.\""}

When approached by a predator, the amphibian lifts its bum, giving the illusion that two round, unblinking eyeballs are staring back.\nDon\u2019t think that sounds intimidating?

Others have simply adapted over time, developing certain pigmentation to trick predators into thinking they\u2019re dangerous.\nA second pair of eyes seems to do the trick, as established by the Cuyaba dwarf frog and its distant cousin, the equally creepy Chilean four-eyed frog (Pleurodema thaul).\nThe spots help to distract from the frogs\u2019 heads and inflate their bodies, sending the message that \u201cI\u2019m a bigger animal than you think, so don\u2019t eat me,\u201d Arturo Mu\u00f1oz Saravia, a doctoral student at the University of Ghent, told NatGeo.\nWhen puffed up, the itty-bitty frog (no bigger than 1.5 inches) looks like a sizeable snake to birds, coati, bats, and other reptiles.\nIf the gutsy pursuer isn\u2019t fooled and risks moving closer, the frog simply emits an unpleasant secretion from its derriere.\n\u201cBelow the eyespots are large toxic macroglands,\u201d according to Tonini, a collaborator on Projeto Bromeligenous, a project studying the relationship between Brazil\u2019s frogs and bromeliad plants.\nThe milky-white discharge is deadly only to small predators; there is enough toxin in one frog to kill 150 mice. Its noxious taste will send any stalker packing; ingest enough of it, and the mucus can cause dizziness and nausea\u2014giving the frog a chance to escape.\nLet us know what you like about Geek by taking our survey."}

Only one Democrat, Senator Ron Wyden, showed up for the start of the panel's meeting on Thursday.\nAlso contributing to delays were questions over whether Lighthizer, a veteran trade lawyer and Reagan-era deputy USTR, needs a congressional waiver from a 1995 law prohibiting USTR candidates from working on behalf of foreign governments.\nAfter leaving USTR but well before that law was passed, Lighthizer did some work for Brazil's agriculture department in the late 1980s and assisted a law firm colleague who was advising a Chinese electronics industry group in the early 1990s.\nLighthizer has strong support from both parties because of his pledges to strengthen enforcement of U.S. trade laws to stop unfairly dumped and subsidized imports, but the waiver issue has become a leverage point for Democrats on the miners' pension bill.\nThat measure seeks to transfer certain pension obligations to the federal government and provide funding to prevent some 22,800 retired coal miners from losing healthcare benefits at the end of April.\nWyden said Democrats' concerns needed to be addressed, but he was \"confident that we can find a way to have a positive, strongly bipartisan markup of Mr. Lighthizer.\" (Reporting by David Lawder; Editing by Bernadette Baum)"}

The compound has been recognized for its benefits to humans and animals. While CBD is derived from cannabis, it does not get a person high. Many patients have used CBD products for pain relief, seizures, inflammation, anxiety, arthritis, PTSD and other medical conditions.\nIs CBD legal?\nCBD is legal in all 50 states, but only if it has 0.3% THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) in it. Some states allow higher dose of THC in these products, but here in Texas, 0.3% is the limit.\nWhat is CBD used for?\nCBD is used for a variety of different ailments. There are different types of products that treat different ailments. There are even products for your pets. Products are even made in different forms. There are oils, topicals, edibles and vaporizers. CBD can be put in many different products, so it's a good idea to discuss with a licensed CBD seller and your doctor about what works best for your needs.\nRELATED: Find our what more of these terms mean in our medical marijuana glossary\nCan CBD cure your health problems?\nWhile some people have said to have gotten a lot of relief from the use of CBD as a treatment option, researchers are still studying the compound to see if it actually cures any ailments.\nRELATED: What is Texas' existing medical marijuana law?\nWhere can one buy CBD products?\nCurrently in San Antonio, there are over 20 shops that sell different kinds of products. Even some gas stations are selling CBD. Advocates warn that not all products are what they claim to be. Good CBD brands will have an accompanying certificate of analysis -- in other words, they're lab-verified.\n** Earlier this year, the Texas Department of Health was considering a ban on certain CBD products. This month, they decided to not go forward with this ban, and leave it up to lawmakers to decide on how to regulate CBD during the next legislative session, which is in 2019.\nCLICK HERE to visit KSAT's medical marijuana section\nGo inside one of the first medical cannabis dispensaries in Texas:\nCopyright 2018 by KSAT - All rights reserved."}

It\u2019s just a bit of fun really.\u201d\nBorn in 1928 \u2014 the year that former Japanese Emperor Hirohito was enthroned and Walt Disney created Mickey Mouse \u2014 Nishimoto is disarmingly young at heart and possesses a wicked sense of humor. She manages her social media accounts herself through her smartphone, while her son helps her to set up some of the shots.\nMany of Nishimoto\u2019s photos show her face contorted in mock anguish. In one instance she is shown having seemingly fallen off a bike as a car speeds past, narrowly avoiding catastrophe. In another, she is whizzing along on her motorized buggy while fighting off a flock of angry birds.

{"id":"b0d96343-5026-4cbe-b7de-38e7ac10539c","text":"By Nick Zieminski and Daniel Trotta\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - A Bangladeshi man set off a homemade pipe bomb strapped to his body in a crowded New York City commuter hub during the morning rush hour on Monday, officials said, immediately calling it an attempted terrorist attack.\nThe suspect, Akayed Ullah, 27, was taken to a hospital after suffering burns from the explosive device, which was attached to his body with Velcro and zip ties and did not fully ignite, officials said. Investigators told Reuters they believe the attack in midtown Manhattan was intended to be a suicide bombing.\nThe blast, which occurred around 7 a.m. (1200 GMT) in a busy underground passageway between the subway station underneath the Port Authority Bus Terminal and the Times Square subway station, sent commuters fleeing for the exits and police officers rushing to the scene, as officials scrambled to reroute trains and shut down streets.\nThree people, including a police officer, suffered minor injuries.\nThe attack came just six weeks after police say an Uzbek man, Sayfullo Saipov, plowed a truck through a crowd of pedestrians along a bike path in lower Manhattan, killing eight in an act for which Islamic State later claimed responsibility. In September 2016, a man injured 31 people when he set off a homemade bomb in New York's Chelsea neighborhood.\nIn recent years, numerous people claiming to be inspired by Islamic State have carried out attacks across Europe, the Middle East and the United States.\nA law enforcement official familiar with the Ullah investigation said investigators have found evidence that he watched Islamic State propaganda on the internet.\n'AMATEUR-LEVEL'\nThe weapon used in Monday's attack was \"amateur-level,\" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said at a news conference near the explosion site. He told CNN the homemade bomb may not have fully ignited, possibly limiting the damage.\nOfficials said the attempted bombing underscored New York City's status as a target for such attacks, citing the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, which killed more than 2,750 people in New York and nearly 3,000 people in all, and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, which killed six people.\n\"Let's be clear, as New Yorkers, our lives revolve around the subways,\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference. \"And let's also be clear, this was an attempted terrorist attack.\"\nIn a statement, President Donald Trump said the attack emphasized the need for U.S. immigration reforms.\n\"America must fix its lax immigration system, which allows far too many dangerous, inadequately vetted people to access our country,\" he said.\nThe president also criticized the visa program that allowed Ullah to enter the United States in 2011 because he had family members already in the country, saying such family visas are \"incompatible with national security.\"\nUllah lived with his mother, sister and two brothers in Brooklyn and was a green card holder, said Shameem Ahsan, consul general of Bangladesh in New York.\nAuthorities did not immediately comment on Ullah's motives. When asked whether Ullah had claimed any connection to Islamic State, New York Police Commissioner James O'Neill said, \"He did make statements but we're not going to talk about that right now.\"\nSeveral U.S. officials familiar with the investigation told Reuters there was no immediate information indicating Ullah was previously known to any American spy or law enforcement agency for any connection to militants or terrorism, though a connection could still be found.\nUllah is from the Bangladeshi city of Chittagong and is a U.S. resident, said the country's police chief. He had no criminal record there and last visited Bangladesh on Sept. 8, the chief said.\nUllah had a black cab\/limousine driver's license from 2012 to 2015, the New York Taxi and Limousine Commission said.\nMonday's incident was captured on security video, police said. Video posted on NYPost.com showed smoke and a man lying in a long tunnel that connects sections of the sprawling Times Square subway station. A photograph showed a man lying facedown, with tattered clothes and burns on his torso.\n'EVERYBODY WAS SCARED'\nThe explosion turned a normal start to the work week into a chaotic scene.\n\"There was a stampede up the stairs to get out,\" said one commuter, Diego Fernandez. \"Everybody was scared and running and shouting.\""}

Court guards pinned him to the ground before he could attack Nassar.\nThe chaotic scene began after sisters Lauren and Madison Margraves had finished reading their victim statements on the second day of hearings at a court in Eaton County. Standing alongside his daughters and wife, Randall Margraves asked to speak.\n\u201cI would ask you as part of the sentencing to grant me five minutes in a locked room with this demon,\u201d he said, gesturing toward Nassar, who has already been sentenced to up to 175 years in prison at an earlier hearing after pleading guilty to molesting young women under the guise of medical treatment.\nJudge Janice Cunningham told him he knew she could not do that, and chastised him for cursing after he called Nassar a son of a bitch. He asked for one minute alone instead. The judge demurred as some in the courtroom laughed uncomfortably.\nMargraves then bolted towards Nassar, seated in an orange jump suit nearby. Gasps, cries and shouts filled the courtroom as Margraves was wrestled to the ground and put in handcuffs while Nassar was taken out to safety.\n\u201cWhat if this happened to you guys?\u201d he implored of the court officers as they pulled him out the room.\nLooking distressed, the lead prosecutor, Angela Povilaitis, turned to the victims and relatives in the courtroom and tried to restore calm.\n\u201cI understand Mr. Margraves\u2019 frustration but you cannot do this,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not helping your children.\u201d\nThe hearing resumed after a short break, with the judge addressing what she called a \u201cscary\u201d scene.\n\u201cMy heart started beating fast and my legs started shaking,\u201d Cunningham said. \u201cWe cannot react by using physical violence,\u201d she said, noting she could not imagine Margraves\u2019 pain as a father.\nNassar is also serving a 60-year federal term for child pornography convictions.\nHis case has sparked broader outrage after numerous victims accused USA Gymnastics, the sport\u2019s governing body, and Michigan State University, where Nassar worked, of failing to investigate complaints about him going back years. US Olympic officials have also been criticised by some of the sport\u2019s biggest stars, including gold medalists Aly Raisman, Simone Biles and McKayla Maroney.\nOn Thursday, the police department in Meridian, Michigan, apologised publicly to one victim for declining to press charges against Nassar in 2004 when she reported that he abused her. The Wall Street Journal also said on Thursday that US Olympic officials did not intervene after being told in 2015 that USA Gymnastics had uncovered possible abuse by Nassar.\nUSA Gymnastics\u2019 board of directors agreed to a demand by the US Olympic Committee that they all resign in the wake of Nassar\u2018s sentencing, as did the president and athletic director of Michigan State.

But he was unable to offer a definitive promise that Facebook would be able to stamp out drug dealing on its platform entirely - though he added that the company's AI tools for filtering posts that violate its terms of service are constantly improving, and that the company was in the process of hiring thousands of employees who would help screen content.\nBut apparently, the opioid sales were only the tip of the iceberg.\nAs a blockbuster report published by Motherboard on Tuesday revealed, cyber criminals have been posting sensitive personal information including credit card numbers and social security numbers on Facebook, and some of these posts remained on the social network for years. Others were taken down as soon as Motherboard notified Facebook of their presence.\nCybercriminals have posted sensitive personal information, such as credit card and social security numbers, of dozens of people on Facebook and have advertised entire databases of private information on the social platform. Some of these posts have been left up on Facebook for years, and the internet giant only acted on these posts after we told it about them.\n... Most of the posts appeared to be ads made by criminals who were trying to sell personal information. Some of the ads are several years old, and were posted as \"public\" on Facebook, meaning anyone can see them, not just the author\u2019s friends. Independent security researcher Justin Shafer alerted Motherboard to these posts Monday. \"I am surprised how old some of the posts are and that it seems Facebook doesn\u2019t have a system in place for removing these posts on their own,\" Shafer told Motherboard in an online chat. \"Posts that would have words flagged automatically by their system.\"\nAnd what's worse, rather than being buried somewhere on the dark web, the sales listings were easily found on Facebook's platform after a simple Google search, as Motherboard demonstrated...\nZuckerberg advised during his testimony that changes to how Facebook monetizes user data would have a \"significant impact\" on the company's bottom line - though he's also insisted that any impact from the scandal has been negligible (despite surveys showing a drop off in usage rates).\nMeanwhile, even as most hedge funds are again getting slammed on today's stock drop, at least one person is making money on the news: yesterday, Jeffrey Gundlach unveiled his Ira Sohn trade reco: go long oil, and short Facebook, arguing that Zuckerberg's apology sounded disingenuous and that \"one more scandal could inspire lawmakers to pass restrictive regulations that could seriously harm Facebook's profitability.\"\nThis could be just that scandal.\nFacebook shares were down nearly 4% in early afternoon trading as the recent dead cat bounce now appears to be over:"}

When she was 7, her mother took her to Mumbai, up a set of stairs to a room filled with women. They were cheerful, laughing. She doesn\u2019t remember how she ended up on the floor, but she remembers her dress being pulled up, followed by a sharp, stabbing pain.\nShe remembers crying, her mother holding and comforting her, the cheerful women bringing her a soda to drink.\n\u201cGrowing up, I thought it was something normal and I didn\u2019t think to question it,\u201d Taher said. As far as she knew, every woman in her family had been through it; what happened to her in India was later done to her younger sister in California.\n\u201cThere was a celebration after it happened for me and a celebration after it happened for my sister,\u201d she said.\nIn cultures that practice female genital mutilation, it\u2019s viewed a rite of passage. But the practice, outlawed in the United States, is also used to exert control over women.\nIt wasn\u2019t until much later that she learned she had been subjected to female genital mutilation, the altering or injury of female genitalia for nonmedical purposes. In cultures that practice female genital mutilation, it\u2019s viewed a rite of passage, performed for a variety of reasons. But the practice, which is outlawed in the United States, is also used to curb promiscuity and sexual pleasure and to exert control over women.\nIt\u2019s a ritual practiced in at least 30 countries. In the deeply secretive Dawoodi Bohra community, a Shi\u2019ite Muslim sect from India to which Taher\u2019s parents belong, girls traditionally undergo the procedure at 7. Taher\u2019s family trip wasn\u2019t planned with the intent to perform the procedure, but she happened to be the \u201cright age,\u201d in the right place, she said.\nFemale genital mutilation has been illegal in the U.S. for 21 years, but just over half of U.S. states criminalize the practice. The Centers for Disease Control estimate 513,000 girls are at risk for female genital mutilation in the United States \u2014 30,000 of them living in Virginia, which criminalized the practice earlier this year.\nREAD MORE: Virginia joins global movement to criminalize female circumcision\nAn investigation by the FBI is now highlighting the extent of female genital mutilation in the United States. In April, the agency opened its first-ever federal case against two Michigan doctors for performing the procedure on dozens of girls over more than a decade. Federal agents announced earlier this month that they are also investigating newly identified targets in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York.\nIn Michigan, Dr. Jumana Nagarwala, a 44-year-old emergency room doctor, is charged with performing female genital mutilation on at least eight girls in the Burhani Medical Clinic, a facility run by Dr. Fakhruddin Attar.\nAttar\u2019s wife, Farida, was also arrested, accused of holding at least two patients\u2019 hands during the procedure to \u201ckeep them from squirming and calm them,\u201d the Detroit Free Press said.\nA federal prosecutor said in court last month that the three were responsible for cutting the genitals of nearly 100 girls over a 12-year period \u2014 and that estimate is conservative, Assistant U.S. Attorney Sara Woodward said.\n\u201cDue to the secretive nature of this procedure, we are unlikely to ever know how many children were cut by Dr. Nagarwala,\u201d Woodward said.\nThree more women \u2014 two local mothers and Tahera Shafiq, a woman who works locally in medical billing and was identified by at least one of the victims \u2014 face charges for participating in the conspiracy.\nAll six are charged with female genital mutilation, conspiracy and aiding and abetting the genital cuttings of two girls whose parents brought them to the Michigan clinic from Minnesota, a state considering harsher FGM laws. The doctors, who could face life in prison, are also charged with conspiring to transport a minor for sexual activity. Their trial is set for Oct. 10.\nMichigan\u2019s Gov. Rick Snyder signed anti-female genital mutilation legislation on July 11, making the practice a felony with a prison sentence of up to 15 years. The law goes into effect in October and will apply to both doctors who carry out female genital mutilation and parents who allow it to undergo.\nActivists view this as a landmark case that could finally bring widespread attention to FGM in the United States. Former FBI Director James Comey addressed the case at a hearing in May on national television, calling it \u201camong the most important work we do, protecting kids especially, and it was done by great work that you don\u2019t hear about a lot all across the country by the FBI.\u201d\n\u201cGeneration after generation it still happens, but [you\u2019re taught] you shouldn\u2019t talk about it.\u201d\nDefense lawyers are expected to build a religious freedom case, arguing the doctors did not perform cutting, but a religious ritual of scraping genital membrane. The outcome could set a precedent for how the American court system rules on FGM cases in the future.\n\u201cGeneration after generation it still happens, but [you\u2019re taught] you shouldn\u2019t talk about it,\u201d Taher said. \u201cI started recognizing that it is a form of gender violence \u2026 that it was something that was happening without the person\u2019s consent. I started recognizing that it was a human rights violation as well. \u2026 I want it to end.\u201d\n***\nDr. Mohammed Arsiwala, president of Michigan Urgent Care, arrived in Michigan from India in the 1990s, settling in the same area Nagarwala and Attar practice medicine.\nThe mosque in that community, which, like Taher\u2019s parents and both doctors, follows the Dawoodi Bohra sect of Islam, was accused in court June of paying Agarwala to perform genital mutilation on girls in the community, allegations the mosque denies.\n\u201cNobody wants to talk to you in the community, nobody talks about it openly,\u201d Arsiwala said; he only heard about the practice from a friend five years ago.\nNow, his local patients are asking him about it.\nWATCH: In Senegal, a campaign of education and dialogue on a painful rite of passage\n\u201cPeople are shocked that this kind of practice was happening in their neighborhood. When they find out about it, they want to know about it,\u201d Arsiwala said.\nThe Dawoodi Bohra community is heavily influenced by its leader, Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin, who has been quoted as saying, \u201cThe act has to happen! If it is a man, then it is right, it can be openly done, but if it is a woman then it must be done discreetly, but then the act has to be done.\u201d\n\u201cPeople who belong to this community are set in this mode that [the religious leader] has said to do it, so we\u2019ll do it,\u201d Arsiwala said. \u201cIt\u2019s a herd effect. When you have the deed coming in from the high priest, then they do it.\u201d\nArsiwala is working with the AHA Foundation, a nonprofit that works to defend women\u2019s rights, to create legislation against FGM in Michigan.\n\u201cBecause this is a religious practice, it has to come from the head of the Dawoodi Bohra community,\u201d Arsiwala said. \u201cHe needs to come out and pass a decree saying this practice should be banned. But he continues to say it is our religious belief and our religious practice and he will continue to do that. As long as the religious leader presses forward these religious beliefs, it will not stop.\u201d\nIn India, Sunita Tiwari, a lawyer, filed a petition to the country\u2019s supreme court in May to ban FGM; it received 50,000 signatures. But a counter group, the Dawoodi Bohra Women for Religious Freedom, emerged to fight Tiwari and her petition.\n\u201cYes, many of us may well be circumcised, as were our mothers and grandmothers before us,\u201d the founders wrote. \u201cThe constitution of India gives us this right to freedom of conscience and religion. Many great men and women have died for that right, so valuable and precious is it!\u201d\nThat kind of support exists in many places where FGM is practiced. If the U.S. is going to tackle this issue, Arsiwala said, it also needs to work with communities abroad.\n\u201cThe story needs to be told about the community and why they do it, it needs to go all the way to [Mumbai],\u201d Arsiwala said about the Dawoodi Bohra sect. \u201cIf we ban this in the U.S. and don\u2019t put pressure on India and other countries, then they will take their children to India, Pakistan and Bangladesh to get it done, and I\u2019m concerned that the sanitary conditions for the procedures will be substandard.\u201d\nFemale genital mutilation is difficult for authorities to track when young girls travel in and out of the country.\nHe is referring to what\u2019s become known as \u201cvacation cutting.\u201d FGM performed abroad and arranged for by family, often while visiting their countries of origin. (This is what happened to Taher).\nCongress passed a provision to end vacation cutting in 2013, but female genital mutilation is difficult for authorities to track when young girls travel in and out of the country.\nShelby Quast, director of Equality Now America, said there are no statistics for the number of girls sent abroad to be cut; most of what they know comes from anecdotes from survivors or concern from girls fearing their families may send them away for vacation cutting.\n\u201cWe need much better data in this county. We need to be collecting this and talking about this issue,\u201d Quast said. \u201cWe need protocol questions that doctors ask, making it a clear and mandatory part of protocol.\u201d\n***\nQuast said the only way to combat FGM in the U.S. and abroad is through broader education in medical communities and schools, as well as wider discussions with communities and religious leaders.\nIn some places, that kind of conversation is starting to happen. On June 5, the board of directors at the Dar al-Hijrah Islamic Center in Northern Virginia, which subscribes to a different sect than the Dawoodi Bohra, condemned comments from their leading Imam Shaker Elsayed on FGM.\nLeaked video of Elsayed at a family life lecture showed him advising worshippers to cut \u201cthe tip of the sexually sensitive part of the girl so that she is not hypersexually active.\u201d He warned that, \u201cin societies where circumcision of girls is completely prohibited, hypersexuality takes over the entire society and a woman is not satisfied with one person or two or three.\u201d\nLike the board of directors that spoke out against their imam in Virginia, religious leaders spoke against FGM at the End Violence Against Girls Summit on FGM in December 2016, stating that the procedure is not required within the religion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very powerful when it comes from experts within the religion or community, when they say, \u2018No, we are not advocating for this,'\u201d Quast said.\nThere\u2019s also a lot of misinformation. The right-wing group, ACT for America, designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center as an extremist group, has claimed that honor killings and FGM in the nation indicates the rise of Sharia law across the U.S., staging protests against Muslims and Islam in the U.S.\n\u201cWe know it\u2019s happening across states in the U.S. We know it\u2019s an issue not just in Muslim communities, but across all communities,\u201d Quast said.\nTexas passed a law on June 9 of this year that criminalizes vacation cutting. Alaska, Maine and Massachusetts are tackling FGM-related legislation as well.\nTaher, who co-founded an organization to end female genital mutilation in Dawoodi Bohra and other Asian communities worldwide, said she expects additional criminal cases to emerge.\n\u201cThis is something that\u2019s been highlighted in the Dawoodi Bohra community, but [FGM] is something that\u2019s very global \u2013 it crosses city lines, race lines, educational backgrounds, religion lines,\u201d Taher said.\nWe need a bigger, broader discussion, Quast said. \u201cIt\u2019s yet another form of not protecting girls.\u201d"}

The letter was released in a filing made to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday.\nDeckers was not immediately available for comment.\nMarcato\u2019s offer to settle the contest has not been previously reported. In the letter McGuire said that part of his offer to settle included putting three Marcato nominees on the board. Without a last minute resolution, shareholders will now vote whether to put three Marcato directors on the board.\nThis is the latest twist in a proxy battle that is scheduled to be settled at Thursday\u2019s annual meeting when shareholders\u2019 votes will be tallied and announced.\nA week ago Marcato slimmed down its slate to three directors who are all independent of the hedge fund after having spent months proposing that it replace all nine members of the board.\nLater in the week, influential proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services reversed its recommendation and urged shareholders to back the hedge fund\u2019s slate. Rival advisory firms Glass Lewis and Egan-Jones threw their weight behind the company\u2019s directors.\nMarcato has been pushing Deckers to sell off pieces of its business, buy back shares and overhaul executive compensation. It forecast such moves could help the stock price more than double by 2020.\nMonday\u2019s letter was part of an exchange of letters that included an offer from Deckers to interview Marcato\u2019s three director candidates as the company prepares to add two new members by September 2018.\nMcGuire wrote that he thinks Deckers\u2019 offer is \u201cnothing more than a record building exercise\u201d after Deckers rejected the settlement offer and denounced Marcato\u2019s nominees\u2019 qualifications.\nMarcato, which owns an 8.5 percent stake in Deckers, comes into Deckers annual meeting with strong credentials, having already won one proxy contest at Buffalo Wild Wings this year and posting some of the hedge fund industry\u2019s strongest returns. Its flagship fund up was 24 percent through November."}

The fruits and vegetables segment led the global biodegradable mulch films market by application in 2017, and it is anticipated to witness the fastest growth rate during the forecast period.\nFurther, the report states that one challenge in the market is high initial setup cost for manufacturers.

I see both sides \u2013 in the ring and outside the ring,\u201d Kristie said.\n\u201cThe fact that these critics think that we are only there to \u2018cheer the men on that do the sport\u2019, while I\u2019m there to support the guys that I also train with six days a week \u2013 well that just proves them wrong.\n\u201cI\u2019m passionate about fighting all round.\n\u201cSome people only see what they see on the night of the fight but I see behind the scenes.\n\u201cI know what it\u2019s like being a competitor myself \u2013 the commitment and the physical and mental strength it takes to even get in to the ring or the cage.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I respect anyone that does, whether that\u2019s for jiu-jitsu, boxing, mixed martial arts, or even as a ring girl.\u201d\nKristie has been a ring girl for the past five years after she started a women-only MMA fitness class in the Rhondda.\n\u201cIt all started when I attended a couple of women\u2019s MMA fit classes. I asked the instructor about being a ring girl and it went from there.\n(Image: Andrew James)\n\u201cI have been lucky enough to work on so many shows and I\u2019ve worked alongside some amazing promoters.\n\u201cI\u2019ve built up a great relationship with loads of people and made some great friends along the way.\n\u201cNot once have I been put in a position where I have been groped or felt like a piece of meat.\n\u201cI don\u2019t find it demeaning at all. If I thought it was demeaning I wouldn\u2019t do it.\n(Image: Andrew James)\n\u201cIt\u2019s a buzz. It\u2019s exciting and fun and I absolutely love doing it.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s empowering. It gives women an inner confidence.\n\u201cFor some women it\u2019s even a way of expressing themselves or a way of being involved in the sport, even if they don\u2019t actually do the sport themselves.\u201d\nKristie says working as a ring girl has also opened doors to a number of other opportunities within the sport, including working as a timekeeper, scorekeeper, and even hosting a show as an MC.\nShe\u2019s also supported a number of different charities in her role as a ring girl by collecting money through raffles, auctions and with collection buckets.\nBut the biggest opportunity of all has been the chance to participate in the sport.\n\u201cI had been working as a ring girl for about two years and met a couple of athletes involved in MMA.\n\u201cThey invited me along to a jiu-jitsu class. I tried it once and I\u2019ve been grappling ever since.\u201d\nKristie is now a blue belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu and has competed across the globe, taking part in the European Championships in Rome, as well as events across the UK.\nShe also won the American National Championships which were held in Las Vegas in 2016.\nAs well as jiu-jitsu Kristie also trains in wrestling, judo, Muay Thai, and does pad work.\n\u201cFor me it\u2019s just amazing to be a part of the sport working as a ring girl as well as being an athlete competing within it.\n\u201cI can be a ring girl on the Saturday and for the rest of the week I\u2019m in the gym and on the mats with the same guys, training and helping them prepare for their next fight.\n\u201cI definitely think I bust the stereotypes open. I do both, so how is that demeaning?\n(Image: Andrew James)\n\u201cMy advice to women would always be if you want to do something, just go and do it,\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s being a ring girl, fighting, or doing any other type of sport or job.\n\u201cThe world is hard enough as it is without people judging you and what you decide to do.\n\u201cJust go and do it, I say.\u201d\nKristie trains out of Pacific Gym as part of The Mat Academy Wales - an affiliate of the Chris Rees Academy."}

The parliamentary impeachment must be confirmed or overturned by the Constitutional Court, which has weeks to rule.\n\u201cWe will request an emergency extradition of Chung, working with the special prosecutor\u2019s office,\u201d Lee Chul-sung, commissioner general of the Korea National Police Agency, told a media briefing in Seoul.\nChung, a 20-year-old equestrian competitor who trained in Germany, was arrested in the northern Danish city of Aalborg for staying illegally, Lee said.\nPark has been accused of colluding with her friend Choi to pressure big businesses to make contributions to non-profit foundations backing presidential initiatives.\nPark, whose father ruled the country for 18 years after seizing power in a 1961 coup, has denied wrongdoing but apologised for carelessness in her ties with Choi, who is facing her own trial. She also denies wrongdoing.\nThe special prosecutor\u2019s office has said it has several charges against the daughter, Chung, including criminal interference related to her academic record. It has not given details of other charges.\n\u2018FOUR IN CUSTODY\u2019\nLee Kyung-jae, a lawyer representing both Choi and Chung, said the daughter would cooperate.\n\u201cWhen Chung Yoo-ra returns I will ensure that she fully cooperates with the special prosecution\u2019s investigation,\u201d the lawyer told the Yonhap News Agency.\nA source in the special prosecutors\u2019 office in Seoul, who declined to be identified, said the office would work with European authorities to extradite Chung, which could take one or two weeks.\nPolice commissioner general Lee said a Korean citizen had alerted Danish police about Chung, who was arrested at about 4 a.m. Seoul time (1900 GMT) on Monday.\nDanish officials had four people in custody, including Chung and a child born in 2015, Lee said. Chung is known to have a young son.\nThe two others in custody are men who appear to be Koreans in their late twenties or early thirties, Lee said.\nHe said Danish police had 24 hours to secure evidence that Chung was staying illegally in Denmark.\nSouth Korea\u2019s foreign ministry has been working to invalidate Chung\u2019s passport and authorities had asked German prosecutors for information about her whereabouts and financial assets.\nChung won a gold medal in the group dressage equestrian event at the 2014 Asian Games.\nShe became a figure of public ire in South Korea last year after it emerged that she had received special treatment from the prestigious Ewha Womans University, where her admission was subsequently cancelled.\nNews of Chung\u2019s arrest came a day after Park broke a month-long silence over her alleged role in the corruption scandal, publicly denying charges of wrongdoing and describing the accusations against her as fabricated and false."}

Then it comes as one report so we [Parliamentarians] deal with it. What he [Dr. Ayine] is presenting, is it a report or an opinion?\u201d\nThe MP said the seeming double report contravenes Parliament\u2019s Standing Orders.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have anything like that in the standing orders. That is why I\u2019m saying that nothing could have stopped him [Dr.Ayine] from giving his report to the committee so that it comes out as one composite committee report, all of us will read and see his views in that report then we will debate it,\u201d Abban added.\nWithdraw report\nMeanwhile, a member of the minority on the adhoc committee, Dr Dominic Ayine has called for the withdrawal of the already laid document so that a composite report will be presented to Parliament.\nAccording to Dr. Ayine, though Minority members including himself and Deputy Minority Leader, James Klutse Avedzi had detailed their perspectives on the saga, the Majority side had refused to integrate them before presenting the document to the house.\n\u201cI was expecting the committee chairman to integrate the report I had prepared with what he had prepared but he stated that he would not integrate my report since it was titled \u2018Minority report\u2019,\u201d Dr. Ayine stated on Eyewitness News.\nConfusion rocks committee\nDr. Ayine had raised similar concerns on Thursday which, according to the Majority Leader in Parliament, Osei Kyei Mensah- Bonsu, led to the committee\u2019s failure to present the report, despite having had its deadline pushed back twice already\nThe Majority Leader in Parliament, Osei Kyei Mensah-Bonsu had told Citi News on Thursday that the laying of the report had been postponed several times because Dr Ayine had wanted to present a separate report capturing the Minority\u2019s conclusions on the matter.\nBackground of \u201ccash for seat\u201d saga\nThe Ministry of Trade, which partnered the event organizers, Millennium Excellence Foundation, is alleged to have charged between $25,000 and $100,000, to enable expatriates to sit close to the President at the awards ceremony.\nThe allegation was first made by the Minority Chief Whip, Muntaka Mubarak in Parliament in December 2017.\nMr. Mubarak said the fees charged at the Ghana Expatriate Business Awards were not approved by Parliament, adding that the monies were also not accounted for in the Internally Generated Funds [IGF] of the Ministry\u2019s accounts.\nThe allegation was further reinforced by Mr. Ablakwa, who suffered verbal assaults from Deputy Minister for Trade and Industry, Carlos Ahenkorah over the matter.\nThe Ministry of Trade said it played no role in determining prices for seats at the event, and clarified that it only facilitated the implementation of a new initiative by the Millennium Excellence Foundation.\nBut the Ministry after an order from the President to probe the matter clarified that an amount of GHc2, 667,215 was realized from the event. This was made known only after the President, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, had asked the Trade Minister Alan Kyerematen, to investigate the matter and report to him.\nThe organizers of the Awards had also explained that no one paid to sit close to the President, and that the amount was raised from sponsorship through a fundraising at the event.\nParliament subsequently formed a five-member bi-partisan committee to investigate the matter.\nThe Committee held several public hearings and a few in-camera sessions that featured all parties named in the allegation, and those who made the allegation.\nThe committee was supposed to present its report on January 24, 2018 but was subsequently given a one-week extension which was supposed to have elapsed on Wednesday January 31, 2018, but failed to do so.\n\u2013\nBy: Godwin Akweiteh Allotey\/citifmonline.com\/Ghana"}
{"id":"29b075f2-a3e9-410d-8487-4ee762e9874e","text":"The latest remake of The Mummy has hit the big screen in Australia. Dating back to the 1930s, The Mummy franchise is far older than the other venerable blockbusters (such as Star Wars or Jaws). Its plotline has been recycled every few decades, from Boris Karloff and Lon Chaney Jr\u2019s portrayals in the 1930s and 1940s to the 1999 hit starring Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz. Universal Pictures envisions this latest iteration of The Mummy as the first in a \u201cDark Universe\u201d multi-film franchise, which will include characters such as Frankenstein\u2019s monster, and Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.\nUniversal\u2019s move is the latest foray by a major studio into building up a \u201cshared universe\u201d that incorporates a slew of multiple film releases tagged with the usual commercial products and accoutrements.\nIn the late 2000s, film studios, particularly Marvel Studios, realised that they could tap into the potential for creating stories that laid out a trail of breadcrumbs. Rather than just a single film, viewers would be tempted to consume many in a series.\nCoupled with the merchandising successes that the Star Wars franchise had enjoyed since the 1980s, Marvel realised it had stumbled on a goldmine. Marvel was quickly bought up by Disney in 2009, resulting in the creation of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a hyper-commercialised endeavour that, spanning decades and involving billions of dollars, represents the apex of big budget filmmaking. The studio has produced 15 films film to date, including Iron Man, Captain America and The Avengers, with at least nine more planned.\nMaking connections\nMarvel\u2019s comic book film franchise is now a multi-media offering, with tie-ins being the norm rather than the exception. Tapping into a form of brand loyalty, the it appeals to viewers on an emotive level, where the content of these films extends beyond the big screen. The hyper-commercialisation of Marvel\u2019s bloated, CGI-laden releases begins months before the release of their films. For example, LEGO tie-in sets from Marvel\u2019s upcoming films are already available for purchase in stores.\nBuoyed by the successes of Marvel, every major production studio is now jumping on the shared universe bandwagon. Beyond Disney\u2019s Marvel and Star Wars franchises, we have Warner Brothers\u2019 DC Comics and Monsters franchises. Paramount is already planning a spinoff from their latest Transformers film and have laid out preliminary details for a \u201cTransformers Cinematic Universe\u201d, with reportedly 14 stories under consideration. Warner Brothers also has another massive franchise underway with the Fantastic Beasts films drawing on the world of Harry Potter. Marvel Studios\nEven smaller budget films are embracing the idea of shared universes. M Night Shaymalan\u2019s recent surprise hit Split has connections to his earlier film Unbreakable. Conjuring director James Wan\u2019s latest horror film efforts are pitched as \u201cpart of the Conjuring universe\u201d. There are even rumours that new adaptations of Stephen King\u2019s The Dark Tower and IT might tap into this shared universe zeitgeist.\nWith a legacy spanning decades that is arguably older than Marvel and DC, it remains to be seen if Universal can replicate these franchises\u2019 successes. Indeed, the marketing campaign for Universal\u2019s Dark Universe taps into nostalgia for black and white film monsters and Hammer Horror.\nRecession and critic-proof?\nArguably there are two important factors that underpin the success of these franchises: big budget film franchises are both recession as well as critic proof, important considerations in a post-GFC world that has witnessed the rise of online \u201cfilm critics\u201d on aggregate sites such as IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes.\nPost recession, the price of entry to the cinema (the price of a smashed avocado breakfast or less) has sustained movies as a form of popular entertainment. It is arguably in this climate that the idea for the Marvel cinematic universe first began, after the release of John Favreau\u2019s Iron Man in 2008. Indeed, the film industry has long been regarded as \u201crecession proof\u201d.\nBig budget franchises also have a track record of being critic-proof. The Transformers film franchises have consistently poor ratings but are commercial successes. DC Comics\u2019 offerings have not fared much better, with releases such as Batman Vs Superman and Suicide Squad receiving low ratings among critics, but nevertheless commercial success. The Mummy, despite savage criticism and a lacklustre performance in the US, is doing well overseas.\nAnd a few have been both critical and commercial successes. At the time of writing, DC\u2019s latest offering, Wonder Woman, does appear to have bucked this trend both at the box office and in the ratings department.\nFranchises and the future\nIn the past, films were considered risky businesses. Film production, at least from the perspective of the blockbuster, has traditionally been a very expensive enterprise. A shared universe approach to film-making enmeshes viewers to such an extent that repeated successes, at least from a financial perspective, are almost assured. This contributes to a presumptuous and repetitive form of filmic storytelling.\nInstead of vehicles for telling audiences compelling stories, shared universe franchises represent an ultimate form of commercialisation that begins with the hook of purchasing a movie ticket, expanding into merchandising, DVD sales and repeat trips to the movies.\nDespite my cynicism, I am also reminded that major production studios are, after all, money making enterprises driven by a bottom line. This was true in 1932, and it still rings true today."}
{"id":"f0b6bb1e-7db6-4281-afd5-9e4138f540df","text":"Why do animals that live in caves become blind?\nThis question has long intrigued scientists and been the subject of hot debate.\nClearly, across the animal kingdom, blindness has evolved repeatedly. There are thousands of underground and cave-dwelling species, from naked mole rats to bats, found throughout nature. Many of these species have lost their sense of sight.\nCharles Darwin originally suggested that eyes could be lost by \"disuse\" over time. Now, Reed Cartwright, an ASU evolutionary biologist in the School of Life Sciences and researcher at the Biodesign Institute, wants to get to the heart of the matter -- and in a recent publication in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology, may be proving Darwin wrong.\n\"We think that blindness in cavefish is indeed Darwinian, but ultimately this disproves Darwin's original hypothesis of 'disuse',\" said Cartwright. In new research, Cartwright explains that eyes are not lost by disuse, but rather, demonstrate Darwin's fundamental theory of natural selection at work -- with blindness selected as favorable and the fittest -- for living in a cave.\nGo Fish\nFor their work, his research team choose to model a well-studied blind cavefish, the Mexican tetra (Astyanax mexicanus), a small, docile, pink-hued fish just a few centimeters long that could easily make its home in an aquarium.\nIt's inhabited caves for 2-3 million years, giving it 5 million generations worth of time to evolve blindness. Cartwright's group chose this Mexican tetra because there is also a surface-dwelling form that has retained its sight. And for scientists, this built-in comparative power makes it a good choice for further exploration. They have two populations to study that can interbreed and are polar opposites for physical traits.\nSo Cartwright's group decided to use computational power to investigate how multiple evolutionary mechanisms interact to shape the fish that live in caves.\n\"The problem we have in these caves is that they are connected to the surface, and fish that can see immigrate into the cave and bring genes for sight with them,\" said Cartwright. \"Under these conditions, we don't typically expect to find such a difference in traits between surface and cave populations. Unless selection was really, really, strong.\"\nHow strong? In their model, the selection for blindness would need to be about 48 times stronger than the immigration rate for Mexican tetras to evolve blindness in caves. Cartwright's group estimates that a measure of fitness for blindness, called the selection coefficient, in the tetra is between 0.5 percent and 50 percent.\nThese coefficients are high enough that laboratory experiments should have detected a difference between surface and cave forms of the fish; however, none have to date.\nBlinded by the light\nCartwright's team turned to a hypothesis going all the way back to a letter to the editor of Nature in 1925 by E. Ray Lankester, that essentially stated that the reason you have blindness in caves is because the fish that can see simply leave.\n\"If sighted fish swim towards the light, the only fish that stay in the cave are blind fish. They aren't trying to get to the light anymore because they can't see it. Which actually is a form of selection, and thus, Darwinian evolution in action,\" said Cartwright.\nAccording to Cartwright, explaining a fitness difference as big as 10 percent between sighted and blind fish may be difficult, \"Iosing eyes might not give you 10 percent more offspring. However, if 10 percent of your seeing eye fish leave the cave, the migration rate is reasonably low, and that could be enough.\"\nIf over time, enough of the seeing eye fish are systematically being removed, they will also be removed from the gene pool, and that could be enough to drive the evolutionary process.\nIt could be this sort of habitat preference that maintains the local blind fish population and the fish that can see are preferentially moving out of the cave. \"We found that even a low level of preferential emigration, e.g. two percent, would provide a significant boost to local adaptation and the evolution of blindness in caves.\"\nCartwright's team hopes that field biologists begin to consider Lankester's 90-year old hypothesis when studying cavefish. \"It would be great if someone could develop a study to test Lankester's hypothesis and whether it is driving the evolution of blindness in caves. That would really help answer one of the questions that have intrigued biologists for over a century.\""}

According to the report titled \u2018State of the World\u2019s Children 2017: Children in a digital world\u2019 unveiled by the UNICEF today, girls in rural areas often face restrictions while using the Information and Communications Technology (ICTs), solely because of their gender. \u201cGlobally, 12 per cent more men than women used the Internet in 2017. In India, less than one third of Internet users are females,\u201d the study said. \u201cThere are potentially serious consequences for girls excluded from the digital age,\u201d it noted. The digital gender gap also leads to the inability to access online services and information on issues related to women health or further their education and skills that could help them participate in the global economy of the 21st century. \u201cGirls and boys in India have the unique opportunity to benefit from the connectivity that the digital world can provide. India is famous as an IT hub and no matter where they live, every girl or boy should have digital advantage,\u201d said UNICEF representative in India, Yasmin Ali Haque, at the launch of the report here.\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) is working with the Centre in developing a comprehensive plan on digital safety for children. \u201cThe Internet and social media provide incredible opportunities for children to learn, participate and socialise but it also brings significant risks of online abuse and violence. Digital literacy is, therefore, key to ensure that all girls and boys stay informed, engaged and safe online,\u201d Haque said. UNICEF, in the annual flagship report, stated that despite children\u2019s massive online presence \u2013 1 in 3 internet users worldwide is a child \u2013 too little is done to protect them from the perils of the digital world.\nThe report also presents UNICEF\u2019s first comprehensive look at different ways the digital technology is affecting children\u2019s lives and life chances, identifying dangers as well as opportunities.\nIt argues that governments and private sector have not kept up with the pace of change, exposing children to new risks and harms and leaving the most disadvantaged group behind. \u201cFor better and for worse, digital technology is now an irreversible fact of our lives,\u201d said UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake. \u201cIn a digital world, our dual challenge is how to mitigate the harms while maximising the benefits of Internet for every child,\u201d he said. The report also examines how the Internet is responsible for increasing children\u2019s vulnerability to risks and harms, including misuse of their private information, access to harmful content and cyber bullying."}

There has been widespread condemnation around the world of North Korea\u2019s missile tests, yet they have remained firm that they will continue to test missiles weekly, monthly and yearly.\nHans Song-ryol, North Korea\u2019s Vice Foreign Minister, is adamant that North Korea will not be caving into the demands of foreign leaders and the United States in particular, and has declared that if leaders persist an \u201call-out war\u201d may be the outcome of the United States taking military action, as the BBC reports. It is this kind of rhetoric from North Korea that has many fearing a World War 3 scenario.\nAfter North Korea had a botched missile test on Sunday, President Donald Trump responded that they \u201cgotta behave.\u201d When pressed further on what America\u2019s next response would be to further missile tests conducted, Trump only said, \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d\nABC reports that Sean Spicer was recently asked what he thought President Trump\u2019s next move would be after warning North Korea that they needed to cease their testing, and Spicer\u2019s opinion was that Trump would be firm when it eventually came to an action of some kind.\n\u201cHe holds his cards close to the vest. I think you\u2019re not going to see him telegraphing how he\u2019s going to respond to any military or other situation going forward. That\u2019s just something he believes has not served us well in the past. So I don\u2019t think that you\u2019re going to see the president drawing red lines in the sand. I think the action that he took in Syria shows that when appropriate, this president will take decisive action.\u201d\nWhile it is certainly possible to avoid World War 3 or any kind of war with North Korea, Vice President Mike Pence has made it absolutely clear that North Korea should not test the United States, as Reuters reported.\nNorth Korea vows to test nuclear missiles EVERY WEEK as military prepares for WORLD WAR 3 https:\/\/t.co\/kupis6GBdq pic.twitter.com\/Ah2dPPRMS4 \u2014 Daily Express (@Daily_Express) April 17, 2017\n\u201cJust in the past two weeks, the world witnessed the strength and resolve of our new president in actions taken in Syria and Afghanistan. North Korea would do well not to test his resolve or the strength of the armed forces of the United States in this region.\u201d\nSo while with international diplomacy World War 3 could be avoided, North Korea doesn\u2019t seem to be backing down. Han Song-ryol has matter of factly stated that if the United States does decide to launch a strike against them in order to avert more missile tests, North Korea has the prerogative to react with a nuclear strike\n\u201cIf the US is planning a military attack against us, we will react with a nuclear pre-emptive strike by our own style and method. If the US is reckless enough to use military means it would mean from that very day, an all-out war.\u201d\nAs President Trump and Mike Pence have both warned North Korea that there will be severe consequences if North Korea continues testing missiles, what will happen in the future if North Korea refuses to heed these warnings? Especially worrying to many is the fact that the United States may already be considering a military strike against North Korea, which was verified by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson when he said that pre-emptive military action was something that was \u201con the table.\u201d This is in spite of North Korea threatening to launch their own nuclear strike if the United States chooses to take military action against them.\nIn order to avoid World War 3 and the use of weapons, China has stressed how important it is to find a peaceful solution, with the Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang describing how \u201csensitive\u201d the world must be in their dealings with North Korea, cautioning against \u201cprovocative actions\u201d of any kind.\nThe Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, however, doesn\u2019t appear to think that international diplomacy is something that will work with North Korea and said that while diplomacy was something that should be used in order to \u201cmaintain peace,\u201d his opinion was that \u201cdialogue for the sake of having dialogue\u201d was something that was fairly pointless at this time.\nEven North Korea\u2019s deputy ambassador to the United Nations, Kim In-Ryong, insists that nuclear war is a very real possibility if the United States insists on not allowing them to continue with their missile tests, as the Daily Express report.\n\u201cA nuclear war could break out at any moment on the Korean Peninsula. The United States are disturbing the peace and global stability, insisting in a gangster logic.\u201d\nAll of the talk between the United States, North Korea, China, Japan, and Russia has made it so that searches on Google for World War 3 are the highest that they have ever been since Google began tracking these keywords in 2004, according to Huffington Post. Also ranking extremely high are \u201cNuclear War,\u201d \u201cSyria World War 3\u201d and \u201cTrump War.\u201d After Donald Trump became president, Google saw the largest spike of all in these searches as uncertainty as to America\u2019s place in the world began to grow.\nHow do you feel about the situation the world is facing with North Korea and do you believe World War 3 is more likely or less likely than it used to be?\n[Featured Image by Chung Sung-Jun\/Getty Images]"}

With already plenty of talk about a future Blade Runner installment, many moviegoers heading out to see Blade Runner 2049 will want to know if there is indeed a scene after all the credits end.\nSo, does Blade Runner 2049 have an after-credits scene?\nThe answer appears to be know. According to Media Stinger, a site that tracks which movies have a scene after the credits have ended, there is no after-credits scene after Blade Runner 2049.\nWhile that may come as a disappointment to fans who were hoping there might be an indication of another installation in the Blade Runner series, Bustle pointed out that there is still hope another movie could be on the way.\nAs the report noted, director Denis Villeneuve said in an interview that he was happy with the final cut of the movie and that it needed nothing more added. That may not be any indication of what comes afterward, however.\n\u201cSo, Villeneuve had nothing to add to Blade Runner 2049 after the credits, but what does that mean for a potential sequel? Very little, it turns out. A follow-up film still is a possibility, and while fans of the original 1982 release might have been willing to wait three decades for a sequel, it\u2019s safe to say that new audiences will not.\u201d\nEven if there is no after-credits scene to indicate a sequel to Blade Runner 2049, there could be other signs of another movie in the series. The film has earned some strong reviews, including an excellent 92 percent rating from Rotten Tomatoes, which has become something of the gold standard for assessing a movie\u2019s strength.\nThere are also some strong predictions for the opening weekend, with some experts predicting it will approach $50 million.

But two knowledgeable sources say the memo fundamentally mischaracterizes the official\u2019s still-secret testimony.\nAndrew McCabe, a frequent Donald Trump target, announced this week that he has relinquished his duties as deputy FBI director, accelerating his timetable for departure. The White House says Trump played no role in McCabe\u2019s decision, though Trump\u2019s son has tweeted that McCabe was fired.\nThe memo, released on Friday against FBI objections and with Trump\u2019s approval, makes a particular claim against McCabe. In its attempt to claim that ex-British spy Christopher Steele\u2019s salacious dossier played a central role in the surveillance of Trump aides\u2014a claim the memo\u2019s own admissions undermine\u2014the memo claims that McCabe told the House intelligence committee that Steele was a pillar of information for a surveillance warrant application.\n\u201cDeputy Director McCabe testified before the Committee in December 2017 that no surveillance warrant would have been sought from the FISC without the Steele dossier information,\u201d the memo claims, referring to the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.\nAsked if that was a true representation, a source familiar with McCabe\u2019s testimony responded: \u201c100% not.\u201d\nA senior Democratic House intelligence committee official agreed.\n\u201cThe Majority purposefully mischaracterizes both what is actually contained in the FISA applications and the testimony of former FBI Deputy McCabe before our committee in December 2017\u2014the Minority\u2019s memo lays out the full facts,\u201d the official said.\nThe Democratic minority memo remains classified. Democrats lost an internal committee vote on Monday to declassify it, prompting ranking Democrat Adam Schiff to blast committee Republicans for hypocrisy in citing the need for transparency as motivating release of the Nunes memo.\nThe FBI declined comment on McCabe\u2019s testimony.\nThe bureau on Wednesday attacked the memo as fundamentally misleading, saying Nunes\u2019 document reflected \u201cmaterial omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo\u2019s accuracy.\u201d After the memo\u2019s release, the FBI said its criticism stands.\nMcCabe became a GOP target owing to his wife\u2019s unsuccessful bid as a Democrat for Virginia state senate in 2015. She received money from close Hillary Clinton ally Terry McAuliffe, then Virginia\u2019s governor. McCabe, according to FBI documents, took steps to minimize conflicts of interest when he later came to oversee the Clinton email server probe.

Until now.\nSEE ALSO: Jimmy Kimmel tears up talking about his hometown Las Vegas\nIn a brief statement issued Thursday, the powerful and vehemently anti-gun control organization surprised many by insisting that \"bump stocks,\" the devices used to convert semi-automatic weapons to act like even deadlier and illegal automatic ones, should be subject to more regulation.\nSilence after a mass shooting is typical for the NRA. Supporting a gun control measure is definitely out of the ordinary \u2014 even it is a play to look less like an evil villain as families and friends weep for the fallen. And then just continue to be an evil villain after offering a tiny olive branch that gun control activists say doesn't do enough.\n\"The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations,\" said NRA executive vice president and CEO Wayne La Pierre and chief lobbyist Chris Cox in a joint statement. The organization laughably blamed the Obama administration for approving the devices for sale on several occasions. (Obama didn't do much during his first term as far as gun control goes, and even strengthened gun rights a bit, according to PolitiFact, but he campaigned on re-instituting an expired federal assault weapons ban for his second term. Sadly, the ban never came to be because ... Congress. Obama also directed a number of executive actions in January 2016 lauded by gun control activists, including strengthening background checks.)\nBump stocks improve a gun's firing range from 45 to 60 rounds per minute to 400 to 800 rounds per minute for the low price of less than $200, the Guardian reports.\nThe move is striking, particularly as the NRA lobbied against similar gun control legislation after the Newtown shooting. But it should come viewed through a prism of caution.\nTop House Republicans had already indicated they were open to a conversation on restricting bump stocks \u2014 something reiterated by White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders in Thursday's press briefing \u2014 and Sen. Dianne Feinstein introduced a bill Wednesday again trying to outlaw their sale and possession. Her efforts to pass the bill date back to the days of Sandy Hook. And she couldn't get that bill out of the Senate due to the NRA working behind the curtain.\nAlso, the issue of bump stocks, while important, has been viewed by many as a minor concession that helps avoid a broader discussion.\nNRA calling for restrictions on \"bump stocks\"- their compromise to keep public from going after broader gun control. They r a bit worried. \u2014 Genie Stowers (@gstowers835) October 5, 2017\nI'm really glad GOP and NRA are behind this, but banning \"bump stocks\" has got to be the easiest bargaining chip they could possibly cede. \u2014 Travis M (@travis_miller1) October 5, 2017\nAlso, media, please don't shower the NRA with praise because they support tighter regulations on bump stocks.

Nearby, the colossal neoclassical CentQuatre (5 rue Curial; 00 33 1 53 35 51 00; 104.fr) was recently converted into artists\u2019 residences and studios, with varied performances and art installations; there is always something of interest going on.\nLunch\nHead back to Place de la Bataille de Stalingrad , where La Rotonde de la Villette (00 33 1 80 48 33 40; larotonde.com) , one of the 1780s tollhouses, has been newly restored as an all-day bar and brasserie, with dining room inside the striking glass-roofed central rotunda.\nAfternoon\nStroll along the Canal St-Martin, with its picturesque metal bridges, locks and tree-lined quaysides. The canal is at the heart of an eclectic multicultural district that has been going through a renaissance. Investigate art shows and a caf\u00e9 at the Point Eph\u00e9m\u00e8re warehouse , colourful clothes, gifts and housewares at Antoine et Lili, sophisticated women\u2019s fashion at Sandro, and bars such as Le Valmy and Chez Prune that are great at ap\u00e9ritif time.\nSainte-Chapelle, an intimate Gothic gem, with double-decker structure and beautiful 13th-century stained glass\nEvening\nDine at Le Chateaubriand (129 avenue Parmentier; 00 33 1 43 57 45 95). The classic 1930s bistro provides the setting for adventurous cooking from chef Inaki Aizpitarte. Book well ahead for the 55 euro, five-course dinner. If you can\u2019t get in, try next door at the Le Dauphin (00 33 1 55 28 78 88), serving simpler, tapas-size dishes.

{"id":"405b3eb9-42cd-4676-ae27-71bfa8467a55","text":"On Sunday night's episode of \"American Idol,\" an18-year-old singer named Jonny Brenns auditioned with an original song called \"Blue Jeans.\" Judges Lionel Richie, Luke Bryan and Katy Perry were impressed. Especially Perry.\n\"You got a face like Chet Baker. Very good-looking,\" Perry said approvingly to the contestant. Then she smirked, looking away and rolling her eyes knowingly.\n\"Look at her!\" Bryan exclaimed. Richie asked, \"Will you stop flirting now?\"\nPerry ignored them. \"It's kind of like this sweet little sexy thing that you've got going on,\" she told Brenns. She agreed with Bryan's assessment that teenage girls would love him. \"Eighteen-year-old girls would eat this up! If a 32-year-old cougar would eat it up . . .\" Perry, 32, trailed off.\nThe scene was presented in good fun, as Richie and Bryan thought it was hilarious and the show promoted Brenns's audition as an \"'American Idol' showmance.\" But as this continues a pattern of Perry flirting with male contestants, how will the pop star's behavior play out in a culture that is now hyperaware of power dynamics in Hollywood?\nPerry briefly caused an internet storm after last week's premiere of the costly revival of the hit Fox series that now airs on ABC, during a scene that seemed out of place in the #MeToo era. In the episode, 19-year-old contestant Benjamin Glaze told the judges he had never kissed a girl before. Perry motioned for him to give her a peck on the cheek - only to turn her face at the last second and kiss him on the lips.\nGlaze toppled over in surprise as Bryan and Richie howled with laughter and gave Perry high-fives. Glaze, who took the moment in stride, later told the New York Times that he was a \"tad bit uncomfortable\" because he wanted to save his first kiss for his first relationship.\nThough \"Idol\" heavily promoted that moment leading up to the premiere, some viewers weren't amused - pointing out that the same situation between a 30-something male judge and 19-year-old female contestant would not have been played for laughs. (Sample comment on Twitter: \"Anyone else watching 'Idol' feel like Katy Perry pressured that poor kid into letting her kiss him on the cheek and violated him by planting one on his lips? Would not have been okay for a male celebrity to do to a young girl. #americanidol #katyperry #mencanbesexuallyharassedtoo\")\nAn ABC spokesperson declined to comment, and Perry's publicist did not return a request for comment. However, as the situation spiraled last week, Glaze took to Instagram to clarify that \"I do not think I was sexually harassed by Katy Perry and I am thankful for the judges comments and critiques.\" He also reiterated to \"Entertainment Tonight\": \"I was only uncomfortable because it was just my first kiss. I'm not upset about it, I'm glad that it happened.\"\nOn the second night of \"Idol's\" two-part premiere last Monday, the show really leaned into Perry's flirtatious side. The episode featured an audition with 27-year-old construction worker Trevor Holmes, who admitted that Perry was his celebrity crush. The feeling became mutual when Holmes appeared in front of the judges. Bryan labeled him a \"dreamboat\" while Perry went with, \"You're so hot.\"\nHolmes laughed, and Perry offered, \"If you're not going to Hollywood, maybe you could just come hang out with me in L.A.\" She also managed to make \"He's in construction, so he's got lots of tools,\" sound like an innuendo. Richie and Bryan egged her on, especially when Holmes revealed his girlfriend was waiting outside.\nPerry could barely keep it together as Holmes crooned a love song, and the camera zoomed in on her dreamy expression. When Holmes landed a ticket to Hollywood, things devolved into chaos as his girlfriend ran into the room, which sent Perry literally bolting in the opposite direction. Again, it was showcased as a highlight of the show.\n\"One of the best moments [of 'Idol'] so far is that so-called love triangle involving Katy Perry, a handsome contestant named Trevor and Trevor's girlfriend named Sierra,\" Michael Strahan gushed on \"Good Morning America\" Wednesday before interviewing the good-natured couple. Sierra explained, \"We had so much fun, and Katy and I hugged and we laughed about it. I even told her we could share him.\"\n\"Idol\" producers and the network seem excited to treat Perry's shtick as a joke. Same with the contestants - but then, do they really have a choice? That gets into the power dynamics issue that the entertainment industry has been forced to confront over the last several months. As a result, it can become more uncomfortable to watch auditions such as the one starring 26-year-old William Casanova: Although he and Perry had an entertaining rapport, he had to retrieve his ticket to Hollywood from between Perry's toes after she found out that he was a shoe salesman.\nIn an essay for Slate, Christina Cauterucci noted the lighthearted framing of Perry's behavior might make sense for the network, but it feels like an odd choice. \"Of course, Perry's flirtation isn't truly sexual at all. It remains in the realm of PG-rated jest - this is family television, after all,\" she wrote. Still, she added of Glaze's audition, \"The scene feels even more lewd and exploitative post-#MeToo than it would have last March. ABC's decision to treat it as a playful, feel-good moment - and use it to advertise the show - is bafflingly obtuse.\"\nRELATED STORIES:\n'American Idol' contestant: Katy Perry kiss not harassment\nWheaton singer eager to inspire on 'American Idol'\n'American Idol's' Haley Reinhart found guilty of hitting bouncer during Palatine bar fight\nCheck out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune."}

More than 13,000 of them were civilians, according to the Observatory. Various estimates have put the war\u2019s overall toll at around 400,000 dead.\nIf the truce holds, the government and the opposition will be expected to meet for talks for the first time in nearly a year in the Kazakh capital of Astana in the second half of January. Those talks will be mediated by Russia, Turkey, and Iran.\nIran and Russia have provided crucial military and diplomatic support to Syrian President Bashar Assad throughout the conflict, while Turkey has served as a rear base and source of supplies for the opposition."}

{"id":"637530ad-1640-4528-843e-57fb0bbbb649","text":"The head of Poland's Supreme Court defiantly arrived at work on Wednesday in Warsaw, rejecting a law by the right-wing government that aims at forcing her and many other top judges into retirement.\nThe controversial law is at the center of the storm of Poland's broader constitutional crisis, which is straining its relationship with the European Union.\n\"I want to show that the constitution and the violation of the constitution are two different things,\" Malgorzata Gersdorf told crowds of protesters, The Associated Press reported. They were chanting \"Judges are not removable!\"\n\"I still hope that the legal order will be restored in Poland,\" Gersdorf told the demonstrators.\nGersdorf had been told to step down at midnight because of a new law that lowers the retirement age of Supreme Court judges from 70 to 65. She argues that she must be allowed to finish her term that ends in 2020.\nThe new law could have sweeping consequences for the Supreme Court, potentially impacting nearly half its judges in what critics call a purge, as NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reported: \"The government claims the forced retirements are aimed at fighting corruption and improving judicial efficiency.\"\nJudges may request that the president allow them to stay on beyond the official retirement age. Some did apply, according to the BBC, but \"Gersdorf was one of 11 judges who refused to make such an appeal.\"\nThe new moves are part of a broader set of aggressive actions taken by the ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS) that entrenches its control over the judiciary, raising alarm from critics who see it as the government overstepping its legal authority. The Associated Press spells it out:\n\"After already having taken control of common courts and the constitutional court, the ruling right-wing Law and Justice party now has captured control of the Supreme Court, the final appeals court for all civil and criminal cases, and the body that authorizes election results.\"\nThe changes have drawn formal criticism from the European Union. The European Commission said earlier this week that they \"undermine the principle of judicial independence.\" It said it was launching an \"infringement procedure,\" which could result in Poland being referred to the European Court of Justice. The Polish government was given one month to respond.\nHowever, it's quite unlikely that the process will result in sanctions against Poland.\n\"Such actions require unanimous support of other EU bloc states,\" Soraya reported. \"Hungary, where the government is carrying out its own purge of its critics, has already declared it will veto any actions against Warsaw.\"\nOn Wednesday, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki faced questions about the changes at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France.\n\"We don't want to rock the European boat,\" Morawiecki said, according to the AP. \"We firmly believe that the European Union has future ahead, we only want our individual, national values to be respected.\"\nDemonstrators gathered in multiple Polish cities on Wednesday, and the wire service reports that they marched to the Presidential Palace to express their discontent with the actions of President Andrzej Duda.\nGersdorf was not blocked from entering the Supreme Court building Wednesday, according to The New York Times. But it remains to be seen what authorities will do tomorrow. The newspaper reported that Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of Poland's ruling party, said Gersdorf is \"doomed to fail miserably.\""}
{"id":"37a8a7e2-688a-4a8d-b12f-b603c8422835","text":"Application range straight seam steel pipe diameter range is 406~1600mm, even larger under special circumstances, the ratio of pipe wall thickness to pipe diameter is about 0.06~0.08. Foreign modern pipe making technology can produce welded pipes with wall thickness up to 100mm.\nThere are only a few methods for producing straight seam steel pipes from steel or steel strips in the industry. The principle difference lies in the forming method of the steel pipes. The subsequent processing of the steel pipes after forming is basically the same.\nThe forming method depends in principle on the distribution of the welds of the steel pipes. The steel pipes are divided into two basic forms according to the distribution of the welds: lsaw steel pipes and lsaw steel pipes. Correspondingly, the production of welded pipes is divided into the production of straight seam steel pipes and the production of spiral seam pipes. The most widely used welding method for straight seam steel tubes and spiral seam tubes is submerged arc welding (SAW), which has good quality, high productivity, mature technology and stability.\nAt present, foreign straight seam steel pipes are widely used in the following ranges:\n\u00b7 Main pipelines for the transport of gas, water and oil on land and in the sea;\n\u00b7 The chemical industry transports stainless steel pipes for chemical raw materials and products;\n\u00b7 Marine industrial structure pipe;\n\u00b7 Boiler manufacturing tubes and special purpose structural tubes.\nProduction of straight seam steel pipe\nThe production of straight seam steel pipes can be divided into two stages, namely the forming stage and the post-forming manufacturing stage.\nThe production of large-diameter straight seam submerged arc welded steel pipes in foreign countries is divided into four types according to the forming method:\n\u00b7 UOE process;\n\u00b7 Rollbending process;\n\u00b7 Progressive forming process;\n\u00b7 Progressive folding process.\nProduction of straight seam steel pipe\n1.1 Forming stage\n1.1.1 UOE forming\nThis method has the highest productivity and is the most important production method for straight seam steel pipes. The brief production process of the unit is first bent into a U shape, then pressed into an O shape, mechanical cooling expansion (Expansion) after internal and external welding.This method is characterized by the availability of extremely stable steel tubes with high productivity and the production of steel tubes over 18 m in length.\n1.1.2 Roll forming\nIn this method, after several steps on the roll bending machine, the steel sheet is bent into an open tube, and the edge of the opening is not deformed and is still straight. Then open the tube is sent to the edge bender and the two edges of the plate are continuously rolled.\nThis method is characterized by strong adaptability and good economics for medium production, but the minimum diameter and maximum wall thickness of the steel pipe produced restricted.\n1.1.3 Gradual molding\nThe forming process of this method is that the steel sheet is first sent to the pressing type, and then sent to the bending position by the controller, and an open tube is formed after passing through a series of pressing molds matched with the tube diameter. There are two controllers in operation, one side of the board is first bent into a semicircle, then the board is second controller moving, the other side is then also bent. Since the thickness of the curved die affects the roundness of the open tube, the thickness of the curved die must be kept to a minimum. Typically, after the forming is completed, the open tube is sent to the edge bender and the two edges of the sheet are continuously rolled into the desired shape. This method is characterized by strong adaptability, economical for medium production, and the ability to make small diameter and thick wall steel pipes.\n1.1.4 Gradual bending forming\nThe steel tube forming by this method was originally used in the marine industry, and it is often necessary to form a particularly thick steel pipe by using a controlled rolling sheet in a cold state, and this method has high forming precision and pressure, and is used for making a sea. Industrial thick-walled steel pipe. This method is characterized by high-strength and thick-walled steel pipes, which are suitable for both small diameters and large diameters, so it can be manufactured in trunk pipes and marine structural pipes; system equipment is low in cost, adaptable, and economical. Good sex, even in small batch production, can reduce costs.\n1.2 Manufacturing stage after forming\nAfter the above forming stage is completed, the post-manufacturing stage of the large-diameter straight seam steel pipe includes a series of substantially similar processes, the main process:\n1.2.1 The edge of the board is machined to weld the groove.\nThe machining methods are milling and planing. On either side of the board, there may be one or more milling and planing heads. According to the thickness of the plate, the groove can be processed into an I-shaped, single V or double V groove with a certain blunt edge. The extra-thick steel pipe can be used to mill the outer seam into a U-shaped groove. The purpose is to reduce the consumption of welding materials and increase the productivity, while the root is wider to avoid welding defects.\n1.2.2 tack welding, commonly known as pre-welding. It is generally carried out by carbon dioxide gas shielded welding, the purpose of which is to stabilize the steel pipe, which is particularly useful for subsequent submerged arc welding to prevent burn through. After the steel pipe is positioned and welded, it shall be visually inspected to confirm that the weld is continuous without any defects.\n2.2.3 Inner and outer welding of steel pipes, that is, precision welding. After the steel pipe is positioned and welded, the subsequent welding is mainly the inner and outer welding of the steel pipe, which is an important part of the steel pipe manufacturing process. It is completed by a submerged arc welding method separate from the forming unit. In order to improve productivity, the inner and outer seams are welded by multi-wire submerged arc welding, and the number of welding wires can be up to 5 wires. In order to avoid weld deviation, a special weld automatic centering device is installed on the welding head. Multi-layer welding is applied to thick-walled steel pipes to reduce heat input and improve the physical properties of the weld.\n1.2.4 Weld inspection.\nIn order to identify the welding defects as soon as possible, ultrasonic testing and X-ray inspection are performed immediately after the welding operation is completed, and the defects are found to be repaired in time.\n1.2.5 Cold expansion.\nAfter the completion of welding, the roundness and straightness of the steel pipe usually cannot meet the relevant standards and technical requirements. The sizing and straightness are used in the pipe manufacturing plant and are completed by the mechanical cold expansion method.\n1.2.6 Water pressure test of steel pipes.\nThe test pressure can be as high as 90% or more of the yield strength of the steel pipe material.\n1.2.7 Finally, the entire steel pipe is subjected to ultrasonic inspection and X-ray inspection and visual inspection."}

It\u2019s not just this year. The monster hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, Jose and now Lee that have raged across the Atlantic are contributing to what appears to be the most active period for major storms on record. AP Photo\/Alan Diaz It's not just this year. The monster hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, Jose and Lee that have raged across the Atlantic are contributing to what appears to be the most active period for major storms on record.\nAnd the busiest part of hurricane season isn't even over.\nAn analysis of 167 years of federal storm data by The Associated Press found that no 30-year period in history has seen this many major hurricanes, this many days of those whoppers spinning in the Atlantic, or this much overall energy generated by those powerful storms.\nScientists caution it is too soon to draw conclusions from the data, and they don't say the intense activity confirms a trend. Storms in the distant past may have gone unnoticed, which could make earlier generations appear quieter than they were. Some scientists say past hurricane data is so weak that it's impossible to connect the recent activity to global warming.\nBut more intense storms are what scientists expect to see as the planet's climate changes because warmer ocean water is fuel for hurricanes. And they say it is important to better understand this current intense period to save lives and prevent worse future destruction.\nGeorgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb said it would be \"foolish\" for policymakers to ignore the data. \"We may not have as much data as we would like, but we have enough to aggressively invest in a variety of defenses for coastal communities,\" she said in an email. \"We face a triple threat of rising seas, stronger winds, and literally off-the-charts rainfall totals.\"\nThe Atlantic hurricane season was more intense than normal in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2016. The 2005 season, which included Katrina, Rita and Wilma, was so active forecasters ran out of names for storms.\nThen came this year. Fueled by warmer than normal ocean temperatures and ideal wind conditions, September 2017 had more days with major hurricanes spinning and more overall hurricane energy expelled than any month on record, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. Harvey spawned record rainfall. Irma had record high winds in the open Atlantic. And Maria hit the U.S. stronger than the earlier two.\nThe Associated Press looked at all major hurricanes - not just the small fraction that hit the U.S. - and grouped them into 30-year periods to mirror the 30-year cycles climate scientists use to understand how the climate is changing. The analysis found that in the period from 1988 to 2017:\n- There have been 90 major hurricanes, an average of three a year. That's 48 percent more than during the previous 30 years. This hurricane season is at five and still counting.\n- During the past 30 years major hurricanes have churned for an average of 7.2 days. That's 65 percent more than the average during the previous 30 years. There have been 18.8 major hurricane days so far this year.\n- Scientists use a measure called Accumulated Cyclone Energy, or ACE, that factors in wind speed and storm duration to gauge hurricane power. The annual average ACE of the past 30 years is 41 percent more than in the previous 30 years. An average year ACE is just shy of 100 and this year's ACE, with two months still to go, is 204.2.\n- Of the last 30 years, nine hurricane seasons were considered \"hyperactive\" according to the definition used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and seven were above normal. Only seven years were below normal.\nWas it just as busy for major storms in the 1930s or 1890s? The numbers say no, but scientists won't draw conclusions because they fear a large undercount of storms before the 1960s.\n\"There's no question that the storms are stronger than they were 30 years ago,\" said NOAA climate and hurricane scientist James Kossin. \"The questions are if you go back a little further if that's what you'll find. We do know for sure that things have increased a hell of a lot since 1970.\"\nSo what's going on?\nScientists talk about two important factors for long-term hurricane activity: man-made climate change and a natural pattern of changes in the Atlantic.\nThe world's oceans go through long cycles as water circulates like a giant conveyor belt. They last 20 to 30 years, carrying water with different levels of salt and temperature. That cycle seems coincide with hurricane activity, Klotzbach said.\nKlotzbach predicts that a period of high salinity and warmer water in the North Atlantic that has been present since 1995 will soon fade - and take with it this ultra-busy period for storms. Other scientists dispute this.\nMore frequent and more intense storms fit what scientists expect to see accompany global warming, MIT hurricane and climate professor Kerry Emanuel said. Physics, computer simulations and numerous scientific studies show that as the world warms the strongest storms should get wetter and more intense, and probably more frequent. Yet, the overall number of all named storms is likely to drop because there will likely be fewer weaker ones, scientists say.\nStill, scientists say it would take more years - and maybe decades - of good data to know for sure if there's a direct connection to climate change.\nNational Hurricane Center science officer Chris Landsea said the problems with missing past storms are so severe \"making any conclusions for the entire (Atlantic) basin would not be justified\" and several other scientists agreed with him.\nClimate scientist Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute in Germany said the data showing increased intensity is clear enough for him: \"The only caveat being that the increase might be exaggerated somewhat because of undercounting early storms.\"\nWhat's happening with hurricanes - the frequency, the duration, and the energy - is probably a combination of factors caused by both nature and man, Klotzbach said: \"a mish-mosh of everything.\"\nExplore further: Why Irma is so strong and other questions about hurricanes"}

In fact these bonds have fallen by around 20% since 2009, when they were offering yields of around 25%.\nTrue, this fall in yield might be blamed on the \u20ac2.2 trillion of assets currently being held by the European Central Bank (ECB). But junk bond yields have been falling steadily since before the ECB began its massive monthly bond buying programme.\nSo what\u2019s going on? The truth is no-one really knows. The only answer anyone can give with any confidence is that with Germany offering negative yields on its short-term bunds, the US not far off the same levels, the ECB charging investors to hold deposits, interest rates in Britain at near zero and bond yields again extremely low, investors have shrugged their shoulders and decided their money has to go somewhere.\nThis week there\u2019s a strong chance we will see further central bank policy divergence which could exacerbate this bond issue. The US Federal Reserve is expected to hike interest rates for the third time this year, while the ECB and Bank of England sit on their hands.\nWhile the ECB has said it will cut back on quantitative easing from January, the Bank of England shows no signs of tightening, while in the US, the Fed has stopped QE and is now looking to return its trillions of asset purchases to the market in such a way that it doesn\u2019t cause an imbalance. All of this will have an impact on the bond market and central bankers are acutely aware of the dangers.\nWhat is uniquely frustrating about the current situation is that it was never the case that there wasn\u2019t enough money in the system. We knew that as far back as 2010 when banks and corporations were accused of sitting on piles of cash. The problem was a lack of confidence.\nQE eventually restored confidence, but so much so that some brave souls felt it was worth taking a chance on the riskier bonds out there.\nWith the increase in demand, even Euro-linked junk bonds were able to offer less attractive yields than they otherwise would have.\nIn a normal, well-functioning marketplace there should never be much demand for such high risk investments. Clearly we are still a long way off a normal, well-functioning global marketplace, but it may feel in some quarters \u2013 though obviously not in Britain \u2013 that we are inching back towards normality.\nYet the process of returning to full normality will probably take years, if not an entire decade more.\nThose holding such Euro-linked junk bonds will have to time the market very well in order not to suffer huge losses on their investments."}

Well, astronomers have done just that after poring over 201,250 targets in the Kepler dataset.\nNASA\u2019s Kepler mission has been taking observational data since 2009, staring unblinkingly at a small area of sky in the direction of the constellation Cygnus until it transitioned into the K2 mission in 2013. In total, the space telescope has discovered over 2,500 confirmed exoplanets (and over 5,000 candidate exoplanets), transforming our understanding of the incredible menagerie of alien worlds in our galaxy. After including discoveries by other observatories, we know of over 3,500 exoplanets that are out there.\nKepler detects exoplanets by watching out for periodic dips in the brightness of stars in its field of view. Should a slight dip in brightness be detected, it could mean that there\u2019s an exoplanet orbiting in front of its host star\u2014an event known as a \u201ctransit.\u201d While these transits can help astronomers learn about the physical size of exoplanets and the period of their orbits, for example, there\u2019s much more information in the transit data than initially meets the eye.\nIn a new study to be published in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society on Feb. 21, a team of researchers are reporting that they have found evidence for individual comets transiting in front of two stars. They detected six individual transits at the star KIC 3542116, which is located approximately 800 light-years from Earth, and one transit at KIC 11084727. Both stars of a similar type (F2V) and are quite bright.\nThough other observations have revealed dusty evidence of cometary activity in other star systems before, this is the first time individual comets have been found leaving their own transit signal in Kepler data. And it turns out that their transit fingerprint is a little bit special:\n\u201cThe transits have a distinct asymmetric shape with a steeper ingress and slower egress that can be ascribed to objects with a trailing dust tail passing over the stellar disk,\u201d the astronomers write in their paper (arXiv preprint). \u201cThere are three deeper transits with depths of \u2243 0.1 percent that last for about a day, and three that are several times more shallow and of shorter duration.\u201d\nIn other words, when compared with the transit of an exoplanet, comet transits appear wonky (or asymmetric). This is because comets possess tails of gas and dust that trail the nucleus; as the comet passes in front of its star, starlight is quickly blocked, but as it drifts by in its orbit, the dusty tail will act as a starlight dimmer, gradually allowing more starlight to be seen by Kepler. An exoplanet\u2014or, indeed, any spherical object without a dusty tail\u2014will create a symmetrical dip in the transit signal. Other possible causes of this unique transit signal (such as starspots and instrumental error) were systematically ruled out. (Interestingly, in a 1999 Astronomy & Astrophysics paper, this asymmetric comet transit signal was predicted by another team of researchers, giving this current work some extra certainty.)\nBut just because there was evidence of six comet transits at KIC 3542116, it doesn\u2019t mean there were six comets. Some of those transits could have been caused by the same comet, so the researchers have hedged their bets, writing: \u201cWe have tentatively postulated that these are due to between 2 and 6 distinct comet-like bodies in the system.\u201d\nUsing these transit data, the study also takes a stab at how big these comets are and even estimates their orbital velocities. The researchers calculate that these comets have masses that are comparable to Halley\u2019s Comet, the famous short-period comet that orbits the sun every 74-79 years and was last visible from Earth in 1986. For the deeper transits (for KIC 3542116 and the single transit at KIC 11084727), they estimate that the comets causing those transits are travelling at speeds of between 35 to 50 kilometers per second (22 to 31 miles per second). For the shallow, narrow transits at KIC 3542116, the inferred speeds are between 75 to 90 kilometers per second (47 to 56 miles per second).\n\u201cFrom these speeds we can surmise that the corresponding orbital periods are \u2a86 90 days (and most probably, much longer) for the deeper transits, and \u2a86 50 days for the shorter events,\u201d they write.\nBut the fact that comets were detected at two similar F2V-type stars gives the researchers pause. Is there something special about these stars that means there\u2019s more likelihood of possessing comets? Or is it just chance? Also, the fact that these comet transits were identified by visually analyzing the Kepler datasets suggests that there are likely many more transits hiding in the archived Kepler observations.\nOne thing\u2019s for sure: this is a mind-blowing discovery that underscores just how valuable exoplanet-hunting missions are for probing the environment around other stars and not just for discovering strange new worlds. I\u2019m excited for what other discoveries are waiting in Kepler transit data and for future exoplanet-hunting missions such as NASA\u2019s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) that is scheduled for launch this year."}
{"id":"791f1e6d-cc6d-4b4d-9f31-030d0ddf40cc","text":"A few months ago, Sylvester Stallone revealed on his Instagram page that he would be directing Creed 2, the follow-up to Ryan Coogler\u2018s acclaimed Rocky spin-off from 2015. The silence that followed was deafening and now it seems like we know why \u2013 he\u2019s not directing it. In fact, a brand new director whose name and work you probably don\u2019t know is stepping behind the camera.\nVariety reports that Steven Caple Jr. will direct Creed 2, with production set to begin early next year. No release date was announced, but leading man Michael B. Jordan took to Twitter and teased November 2018.\nExcited for Coogler to hand over the reins to Steven Caple, Jr. \u2013 our director for Creed 2! Can\u2019t wait to bring you guys the next chapter of our story \u2026 coming at you November 2018. ???????????????? #Creed2 \u2014 Michael B. Jordan (@michaelb4jordan) December 11, 2017\nIn addition to Jordan returning as Adonis Creed, the sequel will also see the return of Stallone as aging boxer Rocky Balboa and Thor: Ragnarok star Tessa Thompson as Bianca, the love interest from the first movie. Stallone also co-wrote the screenplay with Luke Cage showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker.\nThe hiring of Capel mirrors the hiring of Coogler, who landed Creed on the strength of his first feature film, the critical darling Fruitvale Station. Capel only has one feature film to his name, the 2016 indie The Land, but Variety reports that the coming-of-age tale was instrumental in him landing the job. Coogler is still involved in the sequel as an executive producer (he\u2019s currently committed to finishing Black Panther for Marvel) and it\u2019s refreshing to see another person of color continue the story of Adonis Creed. While Creed functioned as a Rocky sequel, it was proudly black, never shying away from the title character\u2019s skin color and the world he inhabits. While Stallone directing would\u2019ve pleased some Rocky fans, a fresh newcomer who can directly continue what Coogler started feels like a better fit.\nSpeaking of Stallone directing, Variety\u2019s article notes that the legendary actor did consider helming the sequel but ultimately decided to bow out after conversations with Jordan and others involved in the film. It\u2019s easy to imagine these conversations involved everyone believing that a black director was the right choice to continue the series. They could have also involved other reasons Stallone has been in the headlines recently. In either case, this feels like the right choice.\nProduction will begin on Creed 2 in Philadelphia in March. Plot details remain under wraps, but Stallone has spoken before about bringing back Dolph Lundgren\u2019s Ivan Drago, the Russian villain from Rocky IV (and the man who killed Adonis Creed\u2019s father, Apollo Creed). What we do know for sure is that Creed is one of the best sports movies of the millennium so far, so, you know, no pressure guys."}

Wentworth Company Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. During the call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this call is being recorded today, August 14, 2017 at 10:00 A.M. Eastern Standard Time.\nI\u2019d now like to turn the meeting over to -- Hartwell. Please go ahead.\nErik Hartwell\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining The J.G. Wentworth Company's second quarter 2017 [technical difficulty]. Today, we\u2019ll be hearing [technical difficulty]; and Katerina Cozza, our Interim Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will open [technical difficulty].\nWe have included a brief presentation to accompany our remarks and you can find a link to this webcast included in the earnings press release. The slide for today's presentations have been posted on the Investor Section of jgw.com along with our earnings press release. Statements in this conference call or in our earnings press release other than historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause the actual results to differ materially are discussed in our earnings press release. The Company disclaims any intent or obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements regardless of whether new information becomes available, future developments occur or otherwise.\nOne of the items we will speak about today is Segment Adjustment Earnings before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization, or Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of our segments\u2019 profitability that our CEO uses to assess segment performance. We define Segment Adjusted EBITDA as our net income or loss under U.S. GAAP before non-cash compensation expenses, provision for or benefit from income taxes, amounts related to consolidation of the Structured Settlements, securitization and permanent financing trusts we use to finance our business, our senior secured credit facility interest expense, debt issuance and related expenses, depreciation and amortization and certain other expenses.\nNot all companies calculate segment adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion and therefore these amounts as presented may not be comparable to other companies. Additionally, Segment Adjusted EBITDA is not indicative of our cash flow generation. Please refer to our earnings release for a reconciliation of our Segment Adjusted EBITDA to our loss before income taxes.\nAnd now, I will turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Stewart A. Stockdale.\nStewart A. Stockdale\nThank you, Erik. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. We continue to execute against our key priorities to grow home lending and turnaround structured settlements.\nOur home lending business saw growth in both loan originations and the MSR portfolio. Structured settlements benefited from the cost savings initiatives implemented last year and we saw improvement in transaction volume trends in the quarter. For the second quarter, home lending delivered $3.6 million of adjusted EBITDA and structured settlements achieved $4 million of adjusted EBITDA.\nHome lending segment earnings were relatively consistent with the first quarter and lower by $4.3 million compared to last year. Two key factors drive the difference compared to a year-ago. One, increased advertising by $2.6 million primarily related to increased customer acquisition costs attributed to a more competitive market for consumer mortgages in the quarter.\nWe also continued to invest in our strategy to grow and expand the direct-to-consumer channel. And two, despite growth in both loan originations and the MSR portfolio, we were not able to completely offset the margin headwinds from increased competition resulting in lower gain on sale compared to the same period a year-ago.\nWe are pleased to have delivered growth in lock loan volumes, closed loan volumes, and the MSR portfolio compared to last year. Lock loan volumes were $1.6 billion, up 14%, closed loan volume was $860 million, up 2% and the MSR portfolios unpaid principal balance grew to $4.5 billion, a 36% increase versus the same period a year-ago.\nThe $1.2 billion increase in the MSR portfolio continues to be made up of quality loan origination volumes, while maintaining consistent performance in the portfolio as measured by key indicators such as delinquency rate, runoff, and age of the portfolio.\nThe MSR portfolio had a fair value of $46.8 million at the end of the quarter compared to $31 million a year-ago, a 50% increase from the same period.\nAccording to Mortgage Bankers Association reports on the mortgage category in 2017, there has been as much as a 50% decrease in consumer demand for rate and term refinances, offset only slightly by a increase in cash out refinance and purchase loan volumes. When you couple this trend with lower new home inventories across the housing markets in the United States, the result is an overall decline in mortgage applications compared to the same period a year-ago.\nHome lending have historically operated with higher average margins compared to our peers. In order to continue to grow loan originations and gain share in a declining market, our margins were under pressure. As we continue to pursue our growth strategy, we believe we are well-positioned with our distribution channels across retail, affiliate, and direct-to-consumer along with our asses to a variety of marketing channels.\nWe were recently recognized by the Scotsman Guide as a top 50 mortgage lender in 2016, and expect to continue to gain share and improve in the rankings of top mortgage lenders. We're still a relatively small player in the vast mortgage origination category and we remain focused on growing and investing in the home lending segment.\nWe have prioritized our growth and investment against key initiatives were we believe we can further extend our brand reach, leverage our direct marketing expertise, and deliver a better customer experience. Our home lending priorities are: first, to continue to grow the MSR portfolio. We have built out a dedicated servicing team to oversee the performance of the portfolio including oversight of our subservicer relationship.\nWe are scaling our front end loan origination activity and have generally retained servicing in the range of 40% to 50%. We have flexibility in our operating model to adjust our servicing strategy based on market conditions. We expect our MSR portfolio to continue to grow.\nThe net initiative is a continued expansion of direct-to-consumer. We look to continue to add resources and diversify access to new customer segments. We are scaling our capabilities in direct-to-consumer channel, which provides us the ability to access customers and offer mortgage loan products through this efficient acquisition channel. This new direct-to-consumer channel already represents approximately 15% of total origination volumes.\nOn the retail front, we hired an experienced leader with a proven track record in growing a network of retail branches. We look to selectively expand our retail branch network. The production from retail branches yields higher margins for the enterprise driven by an increased mix of government and purchase volumes. The retail channel was approximately 10% of origination volumes in the quarter.\nIn our affiliate channel, we benefit from the scale and growth of our established affiliate relationships. For the second quarter, this channel represented approximately 75% of total originations. We continue to evaluate new affiliate relationships and optimize existing to ultimately support the targeted growth strategies for the home lending business. Part of this initiative is to increase the number of loan officers and to that end in the last year we have made measurable additions across the company.\nAnd finally we aim to make significant strides in the customer experience across the loan origination process. Leveraging Ellie Mae's encompass platform, we are developing and integrating with various third parties to address some of the more cumbersome parts of the mortgage process for customers, whether it is completing the initial application, uploading documents, verifying assets or simply requesting status, we\u2019re implementing solutions to ultimately reduce, simplify, and automate across the end-to-end loan origination experience.\nOur customer centric approach will include greater self-service for new and existing customers, more digital and automated options for customers and employees to facilitate speed, accuracy, and quality of loan origination and fulfillment activity.\nWe have already been recognized in the marketplace for our innovation, compliance, and customer service achievements, and we're just getting started. We remain focused in our growth plans and the capabilities we're building now and for the future to allow us to remain flexible and adjust to changes in the mortgage industry.\nIn our structured settlements business, we reported $4 million of adjusted EBITDA compared to $3.1 million for the second quarter of 2016. Structured settlements results benefited from reduced operating expenses resulting from the significant cost-saving initiatives over the last year. Structured settlements operating expenses were lower by $2.7 million compared to the second quarter of last year.\nTotal receivable balances purchases, TRB was $170 million essentially flat compared to the same period a year-ago. Despite the continued competition for structured settlement payment purchasing, we were able to generate growth in our production metrics aided by improved performance in both of our marketing and operations activities.\nThe diversification and execution in the capital markets and the strength of our sources of structured settlement financing has helped support growth in transaction volumes. In the second quarter, we returned to the wholesale market and selectively bid on deals that were a match for our strict underwriting requirements and profitability objectives.\nSubsequent to the quarter, we completed our second securitization of the year. We issued 144.2 million in notes and saw continued strong demand from new and existing investors. We are pleased with the execution, demand, size of the deal and economics of the deal that resulted in a favorable cost of funds.\nWe believe that our structured settlement strategy is yielding positive results. We continue to manage the business for overall profitability, while navigating the competitive landscape and balancing unit growth and unit economics.\nNow let me provide an update on the company's proactive deleveraging of the balance sheet. As we shared in our April disclosure and further commented during our May quarterly earnings conference call, we are actively engaged in discussions to ultimately effect a significant reduction of the company's debt.\nToday we have participated in and completed customary due diligence with lenders and their advisors and have been actively engage -- engaged in and responsive to questions and inquiries into various aspects of the company's operations. As expected with a transaction of this nature, timing cannot be certain, but all parties continue to be engaged and working towards a final outcome with only a handful of outstanding items remaining. We are still optimistic a deal will get done in 2017.\nNow, I would like to introduce Katerina Cozza, our Interim Chief Financial officer. We were fortunate to have Katerina come on board in May. She will now walk through the financial results. Katerina?\nAikaterini Cozza\nThank you, Stewart, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m excited to be here at J.G. Wentworth and working with Stewart and the management team. Just to give you a little of my background, prior to joining I served as the Chief Accounting Officer of Philadelphia Energy Solutions, the largest oil refining complex in the U.S Eastern seaboard with approximately $13 billion in sales.\nBefore that I spent 15 years as the Corporate Controller of Universal Display Corporation, a startup technology company and now leader in OLED technology, which is currently found in Samsung cell phone. I started my career on public accounting with Arthur Henderson.\nIn my short time here, I\u2019ve seen a tenacious sense of urgency exhibited across the company as we work to execute on the key priority outlined earlier by Stewart. The CSO organization is no exception and I was very pleased to see how well we executed our latest ADR transaction. I look forward to leading the finance accounting and control function in support of the company's growth objective, as well as preparing to execute a transaction to improve the company's balance sheet.\nNow let me take you through the numbers. Our consolidated GAAP net loss in the second quarter of 2017 was $12.1 million compared to $23.5 million consolidated net loss in the second quarter of 2016. The $11.4 million favorable change was mainly due to a $19.1 million revenue increase in the structured settlement segment, partially offset by a $3.9 million increase in home lending operating expenses, which is in line with the direct-to-consumer growth plan as well as in response to competitive environment due to the shift in consumer demand.\nOur consolidated total GAAP revenues in the second quarter of 2017 were $101.4 million, an $18.7 million increase from the $82.7 million we reported in the second quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily due to a $17.1 million increase in net realized and unrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long-term debt and derivatives in our structured settlement segment.\nFrom a cash standpoint, at the end of the second quarter, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalent of $53.9 million. Thank you, operator. At this time, we are now ready to open the call to questions.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\nQ -\nA -\n[No Q&A for this event]\nStewart A.

The investigators found that children of obese mothers were more likely to fail tests of fine motor skill\u2013the ability to control movement of small muscles, such as those in the fingers and hands. Children of obese fathers were more likely to fail measures of social competence, and those born to extremely obese couples also were more likely to fail tests of problem solving ability.\nThe study, appearing in Pediatrics, was conducted by scientists at the NIH\u2019s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).\n\u201cThe previous U.S. studies in this area have focused on the mothers\u2019 pre- and post-pregnancy weight,\u201d said the study\u2019s first author, Edwina Yeung, Ph.D., an investigator in NICHD\u2019s Division of Intramural Population Health Research. \u201cOur study is one of the few that also includes information about fathers, and our results suggest that dad\u2019s weight also has significant influence on child development.\u201d\nDr. Yeung and her coauthors cited research indicating that about 1 in 5 pregnant women in the United States is overweight or obese.\nIn the study, authors reviewed data collected from the Upstate KIDS study, which originally sought to determine if fertility treatments could affect child development from birth through age 3. More than 5,000 women enrolled in the study roughly 4 months after giving birth in New York State (excluding New York City) between 2008 and 2010. To assess development, parents completed the Ages and Stages Questionnaire after performing a series of activities with their children. The test isn\u2019t used to diagnose specific disabilities, but serves as a screen for potential problems, so that children can be referred for further testing.\nChildren in the study were tested at 4 months of age and retested 6 more times through age 3. When they enrolled, mothers also provided information on their health and weight\u2013before and after pregnancy\u2013and the weight of their partners.\nCompared to children of normal weight mothers, children of obese mothers were nearly 70 percent more likely to have failed the test indicator on fine motor skill by age 3. Children of obese fathers were 75 percent more likely to fail the test\u2019s personal-social domain\u2013an indicator of how well they were able to relate to and interact with others by age 3. Children with two obese parents were nearly three times more likely to fail the test\u2019s problem solving section by age 3.\nIt is not known why parental obesity might increase children\u2019s risk for developmental delay. The authors note that animal studies indicate that obesity during pregnancy may promote inflammation, which could affect the fetal brain. Less information is available on the potential effects of paternal obesity on child development. The authors added that some studies have indicated that obesity could affect the expression of genes in sperm.\nIf the link between parental obesity and developmental delays is confirmed, the authors wrote, physicians may need to take parental weight into account when screening young children for delays and early interventional services."}

Before joining the FBI, Andrew was the executive director for the Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence.\nBut it was as a 20-year-old in 1988, in a notorious, highly charged case, that he became acutely aware of the toll of gun violence.\nThen a student at the University of Illinois, he was in his family\u2019s home in Winnetka when Laurie Dann, a mentally ill woman, burst into their kitchen brandishing a gun and took Andrew and his parents hostage. Andrew grabbed the gun after she put it down, removed the clip to win her trust, and persuaded her to let his parents go. Later, though, after police arrived, Andrew was shot in the chest before she killed herself.\nIt was the culmination of a violent rampage in which Dann had set fire to a house, tried to firebomb Ravinia School in Highland Park and opened fire on children at Hubbard Woods School in Winnetka, killing 8-year-old Nick Corwin and injuring five other children.\nIn his new role, Andrew will direct the archdiocese\u2019s anti-violence initiatives which will include coalition-building efforts, a greater visibility in distressed neighborhoods and developing programs to help reduce violence and poverty.\n\u201cHe has known firsthand the impact of violence as a shooting victim and will help build bridges as we collaborate with people of good will to strengthen a culture of peace across the Chicago area,\" the archdiocese said in a statement released Thursday.\nThe position is part of Cupich\u2019s campaign against gun violence across the area.

The reports are coming from the FAQ section of Telegram website that is dealing with the implementation of GDPR in Europe.\nAccording to Apple, the latest version of the app which is 4.8.9 of the Telegram app on Android is GDPR-ready.\nHowever, it seems that the company is still not sure how to implement the new regulations on iOS. This is keeping the fact in mind that Apple is blocking the update on its App Store. The iOS version of the app, on the other hand, was updated on March 24 and is currently running on version 4.8.1.\nBoth Apple and Telegram has not yet commented anything regarding the issue. It seems that Apple could be under pressure from the Russian government to ban Telegram in Russia. The telegram had been previously taken down from the App store following the reports of child pornography on its channels and groups.\nLast month Russian government had also asked Google and APK Mirror to block the Russian consumer from using Telegram on their respective platforms. This week Russia's communication regulator, Roskomnadzor, had asked Apple to help them in blocking the app.\nThe ban on Telegram app is being imposed with respect to an order from Moscow's Tagansky court last month. The court had then instructed communication regulator to place an 'immediate ban' on the messaging app as it failed to comply with the earlier order given by the court which required the company to hand over its encryption keys to the country's own intelligence agency FSB.\nAt this moment there is no official comment made by either Apple or Telegram related to the matter. It is surprising though that the app is not being developed globally considering the fact that the ban was meant to be imposed in Russia only."}

These can be useful for the loading of medicines and signalling molecules regarding, for example, cellular differentiation. In his thesis, he describes the functioning of these structures.\nNoteborn: 'The goal of my research is making materials on a nanoscale, that eventually can form structures exceeding this small scale, visible to the naked eye. I've investigated how certain components form structures and the properties of those structures. That is the big theme of my thesis: supramolecular chemistry, intended for medical applications and diagnostics.'\nSupramolecular polymers can be seen as chains of blocks that aren't covalently bound with for example hydrogen bonds or Van der Waals forces. Noteborn used individual polymer fibres, as well as larger networks in which he could, for example, grow cells. He has done a lot of research about superabsorbent hydrogels, made of this kind of polymers.\nIn different experiments Noteborn used DNA. He explains: 'I work with DNA a lot. Everyone knows DNA from its classical role in genetics and biotechnology. But I go many steps further than synthetic biology by seeing DNA as a building block.'\nIn nature, in double-stranded DNA the combinations of the complementary bases adenine and thymine and cytosine and guanine occur. Noteborn makes use of this property. 'You could attach adenine to a thymine and cytosine to a guanine, resulting in some kind of magnets. With these properties, you can do many cool tricks.'\nFigure 1; supramolecular polymer with DNA on which golden particles can be loaded selectively as a model system\nIn one of his model systems, Willem Noteborn used a supramolecular polymer with DNA-strains for selectively loading and releasing nanometre-size golden particles (figure 1). When these polymers are mixed with DNA-functionalized golden particles, they will bind to a DNA-strain on the polymer. Hereby, golden balls can be seen on the polymer. By adding a free, more complementary DNA-strain, the golden particles with DNA-strains will let go of the polymer because they will bind better to the free DNA than to the supramolecular polymer. Hereby, the golden balls cannot be seen anymore and afterwards, smaller golden balls can be loaded on the polymer.\nNoteborn has always been interested in biology and chemistry. His father Mathieu Noteborn is professor in biochemistry at Leiden University. Willem Noteborn says: 'Since I was four years old I've been walking through the lab. The environment wasn't new to me. I had much admiration for Watson and Crick, two of the discoverers of DNA.'\nWillem Noteborn obtained a bachelor's and a master's degree in Life Science & Technology. He first followed an internship with his later supervisor, Alexander Kros. After a biotechnological master internship at the research group of Gilles van Wezel about Streptomyces bacteria, he began his graduate research at Roxanne Kieltyka and Alexander Kros.\nSocial relevance plays a role in Noteborns research. He says: 'My research is fundamental, but it is necessary to eventually come with a social appliance. I think a lot of these kinds of model systems will not be applied directly, but many aspects can be implemented easily. We haven't done medical research yet.' But, he decides, the supramolecular chemistry is a fast-growing discipline. In the future, these systems will certainly be applied in medicines.\nExplore further: Controlling the 'length' of supramolecular polymers through self-organization\nMore information: Willem Noteborn will graduate the 11th of December on his thesis 'Supramolecular polymer materials for biomedical applications and diagnostics'."}

DNA fingerprinting was first developed in 1984 by Alec Jeffreys in the UK, after Jeffreys discovered that no two people could have the same DNA sequence.\nIn March 2011, Bollywood actor Shiney Ahuja was convicted and sentenced to seven years of rigorous imprisonment for raping his maid \u2014 even though the victim had told the court that she was never raped. But the Sewri fast-track court, which delivered the verdict, relied heavily on DNA evidence, in which semen samples from the vaginal swab of the victim matched with the samples obtained from the accused.\nIt was DNA evidence that established the identity of Thenmozhi Rajaratnam, also known as Dhanu, the suicide bomber who killed Rajiv Gandhi on May 21, 1991. And until the blueprint \u2014 another word for DNA \u2014 of some charred bones were discovered in a forest in Raigad, Maharashtra, in August 2015, and matched with the DNA of media entrepreneur Indrani Mukherjea, she had maintained that her daughter Sheena Bora was away in the USA.\nFrom 1995\u2019s Naina Sahni murder case to modern-day incidents of terrorism such as the 2013 Hyderabad blasts, DNA fingerprinting has not only come of age, but is also being increasingly used for crime investigations and prosecutions.\nAs the scientific community mourned the demise on December 10 of Dr Lalji Singh, celebrated as \u201cthe father of DNA fingerprinting in India\u201d, the focus is back on the technology he was associated with, the science which claims to have close to 100% accuracy.\nAlso read| Rajiv Gandhi killing to Delhi bus gangrape: How DNA helped investigators\nDNA fingerprinting was first developed in 1984 by Alec Jeffreys in the UK, after Jeffreys discovered that no two people could have the same DNA sequence. Within three years of the discovery, the UK achieved the world\u2019s first conviction based on DNA evidence in a case of rape and murder. Crucially, the evidence also saved the life of an innocent man who had earlier been charged with the crime.\nLynda Mann, a 15-year-old girl, had been found raped and murdered in Narbourough, England. This was followed by a similar rape and murder case three years later in the same area. The police arrested one Richard Buckland, who confessed to both crimes. However, with the advent of DNA fingerprinting, his samples were checked against those found on the dead bodies \u2014 they didn\u2019t match. Buckland was cleared and another man, Colin Pitchfork, was then arrested and convicted of the murders.\nBy 1988, Lalji Singh, who had been in the UK from 1974 to 1987 on a Commonwealth Fellowship, developed DNA fingerprinting for crime investigations at the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) in Hyderabad, which he joined after returning to India. In 1989, DNA fingerprinting was first used in a case by the Kerala Police. By the early 1990s, the technology had begun to be used for establishing paternity, and to link criminals and identify victims in sensational crimes. From the 2000s onwards, the technology became a staple in rape cases where vaginal swab samples were matched with semen samples from suspects.\nThe uniqueness of DNA fingerprinting as a tool of investigation is not just limited to its accuracy but extends to the way it can sift through crime scene evidence. Advanced DNA fingerprinting can make separate prints of various individuals even from a sample mixture found at the crime scene \u2014 for example, in a gangrape case, DNA fingerprinting can identify each of the individuals involved in the act through one sample. In such cases, it becomes the clinching evidence against the accused, and also helps exonerate those whose samples do not match.\nDNA can typically be extracted from blood and semen stains on clothes or on the body, from hair and teeth (with roots), and even from bones and flesh if they are not completely charred. Under the Indian criminal justice system, there are broad guidelines on how DNA samples are to be collected from a crime scene. It is vital to ensure that the DNA of the investigators does not get mixed with that of the victims or the suspects. Thus, picking up samples from a crime scene with sterile tools and storing samples in a proper manner are crucial for the evidence to stand a judicial test.\nAnd this is where India\u2019s police forces have a lot of catching up to do with counterparts overseas. While central agencies such as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) have found DNA fingerprinting to be very effective, thus ensuring that crime scenes are protected and samples collected by forensic teams, state police forces are yet to be trained in conducting such scientific investigations.\n\u201cThe Aarushi Talwar murder case of 2008 is a prime example. Because the crime scene was not made out of bounds, both police and media trampled all over it. Now the case has no evidence to conclusively establish who killed the 14-year-old girl. Until state police are trained to isolate the crime scene, scientific investigation cannot take place,\u201d a senior UP Police officer said.\nContrast the NIA\u2019s investigation in 2013\u2019s Bodh Gaya blasts, where a Buddhist robe was found abandoned at the crime scene. The agency got a forensic team to pick up strands of hair from the robe \u2014 these matched with strands from the suspected bomber, Haider Ali, when he was arrested the following year. This has now become the most crucial piece of evidence against him, the case having gone to trial recently.\nThe problem, however, is not limited to police. There is also a serious paucity of capacity for DNA fingerprinting in the country. While several states have their own forensic labs, DNA fingerprinting is available only at a few places \u2014 Maharashtra, West Bengal, Delhi, Hyderabad and Chandigarh. Advanced practices in the technology are limited to the Centre For DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD) in Hyderabad. There are also several private labs that offer DNA testing, but all work under an unregulated environment, as a law to regulate such institutions has lain in a limbo since 2003.\nFor all the latest Explained News, download Indian Express App"}

Trial jurors agreed that Compass and bank executive Sam Meade committed fraud by misleading developer David Bagwell as he worked to renegotiate the terms and conditions of his financing for high-end housing projects including the Broughton, Whittier Heights, and Old Grove subdivision developments in Colleyville, Texas.\nAttorneys for the Texas law firm Boyd, Powers & Williamson presented evidence that BBVA Compass deceived Mr. Bagwell about the status of efforts to refinance his loans, which occurred during the 2008-2009 financial crisis and real estate downturn. According to evidence and trial testimony, Mr. Meade assured Mr. Bagwell that his loans were being renewed while the bank was simultaneously working in secret to sell the loans at a steep discount to a competing developer. Once the new developer acquired the debt, Mr. Bagwell was forced into bankruptcy and lost his properties.\nIn addition to actual damages suffered by Mr. Bagwell and associated partnerships, the judgment preserves the jury's $40 million exemplary damages award meant to punish Compass and deter future behavior.\nMr. Bagwell and the partnerships were represented by a trial team including Derrick Boyd, Kristy Campbell and Matt Meyer of Boyd, Powers & Williamson of Decatur, Texas; appellate counsel Jeffrey Levinger of Levinger PC of Dallas; and attorney Jeffrey T.

Conceived by the GBOD Hospitality Group and with a kitchen helmed by Chef Anthony Porras, Havana 1920 exudes history\u2014\u201cchanneling Cuba\u2019s hay days when the island became a playground for Americans to escape prohibition and hit a happening bar scene,\u201d as cited in its promotional materials. Here, Latin food lovers can bask in authentic and classic Cuban cuisine while sipping from the eatery\u2019s impressive collection of more than 150 rums, including French-style Rhum Agricole, classic British Navy, and the hard-to-find Appleton Estate Joy. Also notable is the entertainment, as the restaurant boasts live and decidedly festive music nightly.\n\u201cHavana 1920 celebrates my personal heritage, and with that, we created a place that really transports guests to Hemmingway\u2019s Cuba,\u201d said Joe Santos, COO of GBOD Hospitality Group, whose grandparents migrated from the United States to Cuba. \u201cFrom music to d\u00e9cor to dishes and drinks to service, every guest is wrapped in the spirit Cuba.\u201d\nTo this I can attest, having dined at the locale myself. While the starter options abound, I appreciated the concise entr\u00e9e selections: just four dishes this destination does exceedingly well. As an Empenada aficionado, I tried two of the three varieties available: beef picadillo and ham and cheese. The morsels, which came three to an order, had fittingly flaky and tender dough while the savory filling had big, hugely satisfying flavor. The Ceviche Tropical appetizer was equally amazing. This m\u00e9lange of shrimp, grilled pineapple, jalapeno, cucumber, tomato, onion and cilantro was presented in a sweeter format than the more common acid-driven ceviches, which was a welcome departure, indeed. With it, I reveled in the authentic Cuban bread that Havana 1920 flies in from La Segunda bakery in Florida.\nFor my entr\u00e9e, of the four I chose the Cuban Style Roast Pork, cooked classic Cuban style\u2014marinated in traditional seasonings and cooked to tender pulled meat perfection. Of course, a side of black beans, white rice and fried sweet plantains accompanied. Portions here are appropriate\u2014not overdone or gluttonous, but certainly enough to satiate.\nHaving been so enamored by my visit to Havana 1920, I sought out Santos to discuss what makes this eatery such an exciting and unique addition to downtown San Diego\u2019s flourishing ethnic food scene. Here\u2019s what he had to say.\nHow would you sum up the restaurant\u2019s approach to Cuban cuisine?\nAuthentic. My grandparents migrated to the United States from Cuba; it represents my personal heritage. Havana 1920 is designed to transport guests to Hemmingway\u2019s Cuba; to wrap you up in the spirit of Cuba. We have worked hard to create dishes and cocktails that incorporate ingredients and recipes that would make Grandma proud.\nTell me about the chef\u2019s background \u2013 what are some career highlights?\nChef Anthony Porras has been working in the culinary industry for more than 14 years, with a wide variety of experience preparing different cuisines: Latin, Asian, Italian and more. He spent time working for Eurest Compass Group, which thrived in corporate dining, and has worked for companies including Pfizer, San Diego Gas & Electric and Qualcomm. He also worked at two hotels in San Diego County, first at Arterra Restaurant and Lounge in Del Mar, Calif. and at Park Hyatt Resort Aviara in Carlsbad, Calif. where he learned different cooking techniques from many talented chefs he worked under, and also served celebrities such as Jim Carey and John Madden, to name a few. He earned his culinary certificate from Grossmont College in 2006.\nDoes the restaurant have a \u201csignature dish\u201d?\nOur signature item at Havana 1920 has to be the sandwich Cubano, made with slices of slow roasted pork, ham, Swiss cheese, pickles and mustard on Cuban bread served with yuca frita. It\u2019s served on the Cuban bread from La Segunda Central Bakery in Tampa, Fla. It\u2019s the bread that makes our version of the sandwich special, and lends itself to our passion for authenticity. The Cubano originated in cafes that catered to Cuban workers in Key West and Ybor City, Tampa, two early Cuban communities in Florida; it really is a \u201cworking man\u2019s\u201d meal.\nWhat is your personal favorite item on the menu?\nIt is really hard to pick one favorite item. Right now it\u2019s the Ensalada de Aguacate, avocado salad. It\u2019s made with Caribbean avocados, tomato and onion on a bed of watercress with extra virgin olive oil, kosher salt and fresh lemon juice. It definitely transports you to the Caribbean with the first bite.\nMenu aside, what is your personal favorite aspect of the eatery?\nFor me, it\u2019s the ambiance. It truly transports me to another place. Guests reach the upstairs dining room by climbing a Cubana airlines stairwell lined with antique plane tickets and travel posters. The dining room is filled with homespun tables and mismatched chairs. You feel like you\u2019ve left San Diego and have entered a home in Old Havana where you\u2019ve sat down with family for a bite to eat.\nWhat can patrons expect from dining at this restaurant?\nOur goal at Havana 1920 is for everything the guest experiences \u2013 the food, cocktails, d\u00e9cor, music and ambiance \u2013 to take you on a journey to Cuba; Hemmingway\u2019s Cuba that our grandparents lived in and experienced.\nWhat other qualities set this restaurant apart from other dining options in the area?\nIn addition to being the only Cuban restaurant in the area, we\u2019re very passionate about our entertainment and beverage program. Our d\u00e9cor really tells a story; it\u2019s both unique and authentic with a variety of Cuban-style chairs, Cuban cigar boxes and a machine making fresh-pressed sugar cane juice for cocktails.\nWhat\u2019s new and exciting at Havana 1920?\nWe just launched lunch service on Jan. 8! A sampling of lunch selections, which are available starting at 11 a.m., includes classic Cuban croquettes filled with ham and b\u00e9chamel or roasted chicken and b\u00e9chamel; papa rellenas, mashed potatoes fried and filled with seasoned ground beef and peppers, or cheese and peppers; tostones, the Caribbean classic twice-fried green plantains served with Cuban mojo criollo and Havana Royale sauces; the sandwich Cubano, slices of slow roasted pork, ham, Swiss cheese, pickles and mustard on Cuban bread; and the Elena Ruz, a Cuban turkey sandwich with cream cheese and strawberry on a sweet Cuban roll; among other small bites, sandwiches and plates.\nBeginning at 11 a.m., the ground level caf\u00e9 will also serve a variety of cafecitos and espressos, including: Cafecito Cubano, the classic Cuban espresso served sweet and strong; a shareable version of the Cafecito Cubano, the espresso colada; Cubano cortado, Cafecito Cubano with steamed milk; Bombon, a combination of espresso and sweetened condensed milk; and Mexican mocha, a chocolate mocha with a kick of cinnamon and spicy heat.\nWhat might people not know about the restaurant, but should?\nFirst, our check presenters are actually cuadernos, school notebooks from 1940s Spain. They all have different animals on them, and our manager, Andrew Walsh, spent a lot of time and research to get them! Secondly, when it comes to the d\u00e9cor, one of our favorite pieces are the mini Bacardi rum bottles. Also notable is that we get our Cuban bread flown in from La Segunda Central Bakery in Tampa, Fla. La Segunda Bakery is a family-owned institution in the thriving Cuban district of Ybor City, Fla. that has been operating for 103 years.\nWhy is the Gaslamp District the optimal spot for this restaurant?\nThe draw of the Gaslamp gives us the exposure we love but mainly, we are the first Cuban restaurant (the first Caribbean altogether) in the area. It has been much needed.\nWhat are some of your long and short term goals for the restaurant?\nOur goals for Havana 1920 include consistency and expansion. We look forward to maintaining a high-level experience in every sense of the restaurant as we make this a flagship for this brand.\nHow will the restaurant maintain and\/or elevate its image?\nAt Havana 1920, we don\u2019t want to be stagnant \u2013 we hope to always be adding in new things and ideas.

(AP) \u2014 Republicans are bidding to prevent a major upset in a conservative Georgia congressional district where Democrats stoked by opposition to President Donald Trump have rallied behind a candidate who has raised a shocking amount of money for a special election.\nTuesday\u2019s jungle-style primary lumps all 18 candidates on one ballot and is expected to be more competitive than Republicans\u2019 single-digit victory in Kansas last week that also tested both parties\u2019 strategies for the 2018 midterm elections with Trump in the White House.\nTrump underperformed other Republicans in the suburban Atlanta district, an affluent, well-educated swath filled with the kind of voters Democrats need if they hope to reclaim a House majority next year.\nRepublicans essentially concede that Democrat Jon Ossoff, a former congressional staffer, will lead Tuesday\u2019s voting. That leaves 11 Republican candidates hoping the 30-year-old investigative filmmaker fails to reach a majority. If he doesn\u2019t, Ossoff and the top GOP vote-getter would meet in a June 20 runoff.\nAdvertisement\nFive Democrats will appear on the ballot, but Ossoff is the GOP\u2019s greatest threat. He raised more than $8.3 million, most of it from outside the district. Two independent candidates also are running. The winner will succeed Tom Price, who resigned to become Trump\u2019s health secretary.\nOssoff has enough momentum to draw attention from Trump himself. The president took to Twitter on Monday to blast the \u201csuper liberal\u201d Democrat in the contest without naming names. He said the \u201csuper liberal\u201d Democrat \u201cwants to protect criminals, allow illegal immigration and raise taxes!\u201d Trump, Ossoff answered in a statement, is \u201cmisinformed.\u201d\nBoth major parties have dispatched paid field staffers. Republican groups are running a blitz of ads trying to tie Ossoff to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi; a political action committee backed by House Speaker Ryan has spent more than $2 million.\nKaren Handel, Georgia\u2019s former secretary of state, has led the Republican field. Technology executive Bob Gray; and two former state senators, Dan Moody and Judson Hill \u2014 are polling closest to Handel in a fight for the No. 2 spot.\nThe GOP scramble has been intense, with GOP rivals accusing Handel of being a political opportunist and the conservative Club for Growth spending six figures on ads to defeat her.\nNational Republicans say any of the four competitive GOP candidates could defeat Ossoff in a second round of voting. GOP voters, they predict, would be energized in a Republican vs. Democrat scenario, making it harder for Ossoff to run above the fray as he has leading up to the primary.\nOssoff has tried to walk a line between liberals looking for a chance to oppose Trump and Republicans who couldn\u2019t support him in November. Ossoff pledges to fight Trump when he \u201cembarrasses\u201d the country. But he tells voters in one ad, \u201cI\u2019ll work with anybody in Washington who respects your tax dollars.\u201d\nHandel is among the Republican candidates trying to maintain some distance from Trump, rarely discussing him unless asked. Gray has instead tried to portray himself as a \u201cwilling partner\u201d for the president. Other Republican candidates, though, have questioned whether Gray always backed Trump or is simply strategizing a path to a runoff election.\nPolls will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.\n___\nFollow Foody and Barrow on Twitter at https:\/\/twitter.com\/KatieFoody and https:\/\/twitter.com\/BillBarrowAP"}

As stylish as it is functional, G-STEEL provides you the ability to feel put together, wherever your day may take you. This watch is built with Bluetooth connectivity to ensure no matter where you are, anywhere in the world, you never have to second guess a quick glance at your watch.\nWith its sophisticated chronograph face and stainless steel band, it blends seamlessly into any man\u2019s wardrobe. But not to worry guys, it\u2019s still the G-SHOCK you\u2019ve come to know and rely on, which means it\u2019s built with the seven elements that make it the toughest watch of all time: electric shock resistance, gravity resistance, low-temperature resistance, vibration resistance, water resistance, shock resistance, and overall toughness. These elements are the foundation of G-SHOCK, but up until now, the options didn\u2019t lend themselves to anything but what you would think a rugged, tough watch would. In other words, there may have been pause before wearing your G-SHOCK on certain, more dressed up occasions. Not anymore. Not with G-STEEL.\nThis watch is as handsome as it is rugged. With its double-layer bezel and stainless steel band, it\u2019s built as much for the paddle board as it is for the boardroom. Showing up straight to the office from flying the red-eye, you can rest assured that the Bluetooth connection to your phone keeps your time up to date, no matter the time-zone. It\u2019s self-adjusting, which means it receives time calibration signals and corrects the time automatically \u2014 this even includes Daylight Savings Time. If wearing your G-SHOCK with your suit wasn\u2019t an option for you did in the past, those times are over. The sleek metallic finish of G-STEEL keeps you dressed up, even if you only throw your suit on when absolutely necessary.\nBecause it\u2019s everything you have come to appreciate about a G-SHOCK, this watch still looks great with your jeans, a t-shirt, and a leather jacket. Included in the nearly 53.88mm case are neo-brite luminous hands, a world time display, your daily alarm, stopwatch, countdown timer, date display, and a full auto calendar. Wearing this straight from Friday at the office, to late night at the bar, to wearing it all weekend, this watch is uncompromising in its ability to look as good as it functions for everywhere the adventure of life takes you."}

Whether it's J.D. Salinger, Margaret Atwood or any lesser hack it's all the same: a person at their most alone confronting a blank page. Being a writer can be glamorous; writing is always tedium.\nDirector Danny Strong pulls out the same clich\u00e9s Hollywood has used over and again to try to make the process more interesting than it actually is in his biopic of Salinger, based on Kenneth Slawenski's biography J.D. Salinger: A Life, published in 2010, the year the reclusive author died. We see the young Salinger stuck at his desk lighting matches and throwing pages in the garbage. We see his trembling hand hovering above a page. There is sometimes music. When all else fails, there's a montage.\nDon't blame Strong, who wrote Lee Daniels's The Butler, and here makes his feature directorial debut, for failing to make writing cinematically interesting when no one else has pulled it off. But do blame him for creating a hackneyed portrait unbefitting its subject.\nStory continues below advertisement\nWhen we first see Salinger, he is struggling with PTSD from his time in combat in Europe and unable to write.Then we flash back to 1939, when a fresh-faced Salinger, played capably by Nicholas Hoult, is chasing girls and full of himself and his talent. His father (Victor Garber) tells him he'll never succeed. \"I just don't want you to be disappointed when it doesn't work out,\" he says. But Salinger's loving mom (Hope Davis) encourages him to attend creative writing classes at Columbia University. It's there that young Salinger meets Story magazine editor Whit Burnett (Kevin Spacey) who spars with the smart aleck and helps draw out his abilities in the dashing, patches-on-elbows inspiring manner of every creative writing teacher ever seen on film, usually with artlessly direct dialogue. \"Do you write to show off your talent, or express what's in your heart?\" Burnett asks at one point.\nAll the while Salinger complains about phonies, literary and otherwise. One wonders how livid he would be at Strong's portrayal of the creative process. Every time inspiration hits Salinger, whether it's young children at a table or the sight of a carousel in Central Park, the camera freezes, music swells and Salinger stands there dumbstruck. The only thing missing is a light bulb over his head.\nWhen the U.S. enters the Second World War, Salinger is shipped overseas. A very few scenes show us the horrors he experienced, including brief glimpses of concentration camps. Salinger comes home a changed man totally committed to the purity of his vision. He's got a story featuring a character named Holden Caulfield whom editors love. It's Burnett who keeps insisting Holden isn't a short story, he's a novel.\nSalinger clashes with editors, insisting that literature should reflect real life, and real life often doesn't have happy endings. He'll even turn down The New Yorker if he must, because he's a rebel. \"I won't do it, I won't change a word!\" he yells at his agent (Sarah Paulson), \"Holden would not approve!\"\nWhen Catcher in the Rye is published, Salinger is stalked by strangers who insist they are Holden Caulfield. He tries to find peace through meditation and Zen Buddhism. His swami (Bernard White) keeps telling him to remove distractions from his life. So Salinger moves to a farmhouse in Cornish, N.H., with his wife and young child. There is a very brief exchange with a high school girl, but otherwise the film ignores his affairs with, and some have said his exploitation of, younger women, including teenaged girls he pursued in his 50s.\nThis is the way it is with Rebel in the Rye: It wants so much to cover everything, and do so in a way that is so laudatory of Salinger's genius and purity that it never really delves into anything interesting or complex. It merely skims.\nOnce Salinger decides not to publish and has removed himself from the world, we hear him say that writing has become his religion. It's one last artlessly direct declaration in a film stuffed with them.\nStory continues below advertisement\nStory continues below advertisement\nRebel in the Rye keeps insisting that Salinger's genius was his dedication to truth stripped of clich\u00e9 while giving us little more than a trite portrayal of a literary legend."}

Wealth managers in the two centres generally don't disclose the overall revenues they make from recommending funds to clients.\nThe moves could upend the existing fee-sharing model between the funds industry and wealth managers as clients may increase scrutiny of the products they buy to discern any conflicts of interest.\nIt may lead to a drop in fees from such deals and could even make clients bypass wealth managers altogether and source products directly from fund managers, with smaller wealth managers most vulnerable because their revenue mainly comes from selling third-party products to clients, analysts say.\n\"The increased transparency will allow investors to have much clearer visibility of how much money investment advisers make from fund managers for distributing their products, and investors may think more carefully before buying a fund,\" said Karen Man, partner at law firm Baker McKenzie.\n\"It will likely increase competition for all the players, and mainly the smaller ones, who may depend on product distribution as a principal source of revenue,\" said Man, who focuses on financial service regulation.\nAssets of the 20 largest private banks in Asia rose by 6 percent last year to a record $1.6 trillion, according to data from industry tracker Asian Private Banker. The bulk of the assets in the region are invested in the equity markets directly or via funds, making it lucrative for the wealth managers to earn fees on sale of those products.\nThe wealth managers get a cut of 0.5 percent to as much as 6.0 percent of the management fees charged by investment firms on the assets clients put into funds. They also get the so-called trailer fee, which is money paid to them annually as long as clients hold the investment products in their portfolios.\nCONSULTATION PAPER\nThe moves by Hong Kong and Singapore to increase disclosure follow similar initiatives by regulators of some Western nations after investors faced hefty losses on structured products linked to the collapse of Lehman Brothers.\nDefaults of some illiquid, high-yielding bonds in Singapore last year also cast the spotlight on the role of wealth managers in \"pushing\" the products, the sources said.\nHong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) received industry feedback on fee disclosures earlier this year in response to a consultation paper. The paper argued that fee disclosures would make it easier for clients to spot potential instances of conflicts, and lead to lower fees in the long run.\n\"Based on a preliminary review, the responses received are generally supportive of our proposal to enhance disclosure with comments on the suggested manner of disclosure,\" SFC said in an emailed response to Reuters, adding it will issue conclusions on the consultation after a detailed review.\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore said that \"work is under way to require trailer fees to be disclosed in the Product Highlight Sheet.\"\nFor the smaller wealth managers in Asia, the disclosure requirements could come at a particularly tough time as they are already reeling from higher costs and cutthroat competition.\nAs a result, many smaller Western wealth managers have shut shop, despite Asia-Pacific being the fastest growing wealth region in the world with nearly 5 million individuals having $1 million in liquid assets.\nAndrew Hendry, director at Hong-Kong based Westoun Advisors, said the potential fee disclosure rules could make clients approach fund houses directly and cut out wealth managers.\n\"We are starting to see a lot of negotiations in the fee sharing space,\" he said.\nClients of wealth managers, however, back the proposed changes.\n\"Since the Lehman mini-bond debacle, wealth managers have become more careful of stuffing unwanted products down clients' throats for fees and this new push to transparency is welcome,\" said a client of a European private bank in Hong Kong.\n(Reporting by Sumeet Chatterjee and Saikat Chatterjee; Additional reporting by Anshuman Daga in SINGAPORE; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)"}

(AP Photo\/Mark J. Terrill)\nIn the first four games of the season, the Philadelphia Eagles running back by committee setup appears to be working.\nBy Chris Murray\nFor the Chris Murray Report and the Philadelphia Sunday Sun\nThe one obvious sign of growth for the Philadelphia Eagles in the team\u2019s first four games has been the ability to run the football.\nAnd I\u2019m not just talking about the raw numbers which have been impressive to this point in the season. As a team, the Birds are tied for third in rushing yardage per game with the Denver Broncos and are averaging 143 yards per game.\nWhile the old running back in me is not a huge fan of running back by committee, LaGarrette Blount, Wendell Smallwood and rookie Corey Clement are doing a good job of taking the Birds run game to the next level, especially with the absence of Darren Sproles, who is out for the season with leg and arm injuries.\nIn last Sunday\u2019s 26-24 win over the Los Angeles Chargers, the Eagles ground attack compiled 214 yards. Blount did his best Beast Mode imitation, boring through the Los Angeles Chargers defense for 136 yards on 16 carries, including a 68- yard run that would even make Marshawn Lynch blush.\nMeanwhile, Smallwood and Clement contributed their fair share to the ground attack with their ability to catch the football out of the backfield, block in the passing game, and by carrying the football inside the red zone.\nBoth Smallwood and Clement ran for 30 or more yards including one touchdown in the win over the Chargers. Even quarterback Carson Wentz got in on the running game by keeping drives alive with his legs.\nBut the thing that was most impressive about the Eagles running game is that it kept the defense off the field. Against the Chargers, the Birds dominated the game in time of possession. They held the ball for 39:18 as compared to 20:42. That\u2019s a nearly 2-1 advantage. The Eagles also did an outstanding job of keeping drives going on third down. They were 9-of-16 converting third downs.\n\u201cWe\u2019re staying on the field, and then out third-down conversion rate has been good,\u201d Eagles head coach Doug Pederson said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve been able to stay on the field. All that is part of time of possession.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then, of course, the run game, being patient there. Yesterday was an example. We got a few more chunk-play runs, but at the same time it all factors into time of possession.\u201d\nMore often than not, time of possession in football does not always translate into victories and it is not always indication of a team\u2019s dominance. Against the Chargers, the Birds rushing attack managed to do something it hasn\u2019t done in quite some time: Close the show.\nAfter the Chargers cut the lead to two points with 6:44 left in the game, the Eagles running game muscled down the clock and kept the Chargers offense on the sideline for the remainder of the game. The Eagles offense was their s defense in that game.\n\u201cThe ability to close out close games ends up making the difference between playoffs or not and so the fact that doing in now is good,\u201d Eagles center Jason Kelce said.\nThat\u2019s true. Of course, the Eagles would like to score points to give them a cushion to where they don\u2019t have to always close out the show with the running game. But if the Birds, who are currently in first place in the NFC East, can bottle up last Sunday\u2019s effort to put the game away, they will be a tough team to beat."}

He has to rest.\"\nLe Parisien suggested that the world's most expensive player will definitely miss Wednesday's French Cup quarter-final at home against Marseille as well as next Saturday's trip to Troyes in Ligue 1.\nNeymar himself posted a picture on Instagram of his right leg with the ankle and foot heavily bandaged. \"08:10. Finished for today,\" said the caption.\nThe Champions League last 16, second leg against Real at the Parc des Princes in Paris on March 6 is just over a week away, leaving Neymar little time to recover fitness as PSG look to overturn a 3-1 deficit from the first leg in Madrid.\nDespite the injury potentially benefiting Madrid, the Spanish side's coach Zinedine Zidane claimed he hoped Neymar would recover in time to play.\n\"I'm not happy with the Neymar injury and I hope he can be back for the game. I will never want a rival player to be out injured,\" Zidane said at a press conference in the Spanish capital.\nHis opposite number Emery said on Sunday night, as Neymar was leaving the Parc des Princes on crutches, that he was \"optimistic\" about the injury.\n\"We will be optimistic. If I had to say today (whether or not he will face Real) I would rather say yes,\" said the Spaniard.\nPSG are 14 points clear of Monaco at the top of Ligue 1 after Sunday's game, but the Champions League is crucial to the French club, who lost to Neymar's Barcelona at the same stage last season."}

But he was not immediately able to produce provincial-level data to counter claims that Saskatchewan is a special case.\nThat\u2019s something Environment Minister Dustin Duncan criticized the federal government for failing to do last week, as he announced a study contracted out to the University of Regina\u2019s Institute for Energy, Environment and Sustainable Communities. He said it showed that Saskatchewan\u2019s export-dependent economy would suffer $16 billion in lost growth by 2030.\nBut Goodale said the scenario analyzed by that study bears little resemblance to any realistic carbon-pricing plan \u2014 neither to the federal backstop nor to what other provinces are doing. He said it\u2019s \u201cdivorced from reality\u201d and paints a \u201cworst-case scenario.\u201d\n\u201cThey assume a carbon tax and then they assume the carbon tax would be fully applicable to agriculture and farm fuel consumed in agriculture,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have made it abundantly clear from the very beginning that farm fuel consumed in agriculture is exempt.\u201d\nThat makes a big difference, said Goodale, given the value of agriculture to Saskatchewan. He said the study also doesn\u2019t account for options like sparing small oil and gas producers, as other provinces have chosen to do.\n\u201cThe provincial focus has been in a single-minded way on setting up the straw man of a carbon tax as the only game in town and then knocking down that straw man,\u201d said Goodale.\nSaskatchewan\u2019s Environment Ministry responded to Goodale\u2019s criticisms in a written statement to the Leader-Post, saying that agriculture is only \u201cpartially exempt\u201d from the federal tax. It said that the scenario Duncan highlighted \u201creflects the federal government\u2019s plan,\u201d with the exception of output-based performance standards that are not yet known.\n\u201cThe federal carbon tax offers no exemption for natural gas or propane used to dry grain or heat farm buildings or for fuel used to ship products to market,\u201d read the province\u2019s statement. \u201cThese same producers sequester close to 12 million tonnes of carbon dioxide yet will still be subject to increased taxes by the federal government.\u201d\nThe two sides also disagree on how the study treats carbon tax revenues. Goodale argues it doesn\u2019t account for all the ways the province could use the money to protect sensitive industries or reward innovation, including in agriculture. But the provincial statement notes that there is no evidence the federal plan \u2014 presumably meaning a backstop carbon tax under the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act \u2014 would do that.\nOttawa\u2019s carbon backstop will come into effect in 2019 if Saskatchewan fails to design a system that complies with federal standards, starting at $10 per tonne and rising to $50 per tonne by 2022.\nAll the money will be returned to Saskatchewan, according to the Act. But it leaves plenty of wiggle room about how. That has prompted some to speculate that the feds will simply send the revenues back to taxpayers.\nGoodale, however, hinted that might not be the case.\n\u201cThe form in which it would be returned to Saskatchewan has yet to be determined,\u201d he said. \u201cThe objective obviously would be to have the maximum economic benefit, not just fritter it away. And the Saskatchewan model assumes you fritter it away.\u201d\nHe said the federal government will look carefully at the province\u2019s study to see if anything can be gleaned from it. But he said he thinks independent analysis is generally more helpful than government-sponsored research \u2014 a justification he offered for Ottawa\u2019s reticence to release its own numbers.\n\u201cIf either level of government does the arithmetic in house, it is going to be suspect by one side or the other,\u201d he said, though he argued that the national-level data implies that it would be \u201csimply impossible\u201d for Saskatchewan to lose the $1.8 billion in annual GDP growth the province is forecasting after 2022.\nGoodale said the province\u2019s study falls short of what he\u2019d call independent.\n\u201cThe government commissioned the study, the government paid for the study, the government set the terms of reference for the study and there was at least one employee of the government that was a part of the analysis,\u201d he said.\nScott Pittendrigh, listed as an employee of the Environment Ministry\u2019s Climate Change Branch on a web posting for the study, ceased employment with the government in November of last year, according to the province\u2019s statement.\nThat was just months before the ministry sole-sourced a contract with the institute to analyze the results in January, but well after it awarded the contract to develop the model for the study.\nawhite-crummey@postmedia.com"}

The Muslim prayer is addressed directly to the Creator, without any sons, partners, semi-Gods, saints, or ancestors who intervene on the supplicant\u2019s behalf. In other words, we don\u2019t need \u201cwasta\u201d with God. We are taught to pray directly to the source of all good \u2013 God Almighty \u2013 and that praying to others or expecting benefit from them is offensive to God and a great sin.\nHe said in the Quran, \u201cAnd when My servants ask you concerning Me, then surely I am very near; I answer the prayer of the suppliant when he calls on Me, so they should answer My call and believe in Me that they may walk in the right way.\u201d (2:186) If God Himself hears our prayer and answers us, why would we ever ask another? In addition to performing formal prayers at regular intervals so that we are trained to connect with God often, we are encouraged to engage often in remembrance of God and supplication.\nSupplication is informal communications with God, a spontaneous prayer from the heart of a believer at any moment during his life \u2013 in times of need, in moments of joy, during reflection or strenuous effort. The prophet Mohammed (PBUH) set a perfect example by supplicating often from the time he woke up until he slept at night. He repented often, sought God\u2019s help at every opportunity and constantly glorified He who sustains us, provides for us and guides us throughout our lives.\nHis supplications were recorded by his companions and touch every aspect of life \u2013 from the usually mindless activities such as dressing in the morning to the most serious and somber situations like preparing a body for burial. Ramadan is a month full of many blessings and a superior time for supplication. This can be inferred from the statement of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), who said, \u201cWhen Ramadan comes, the Doors of Mercy (another narration says Paradise) are opened, and the doors of Hell are closed, and the devils are locked up.\u201d\n(Sahih al-Bukhari #1899, Muslim #1079)Thus, it is clear that supplication during Ramadan has a greater chance of being accepted, as the Gates of Paradise and Mercy are opened. Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) also said, \u201cThree supplications will not be rejected (by Almighty God), the supplication of the parent for his child, the supplication of the one who is fasting, and the supplication of the traveler. [at-Tirmidhi].\nBecause Ramadan is the month of fasting, it is one of the best times to supplicate to our Creator for whatever our hearts desire. But be careful what you ask for! Ask things that are really important and valuable, not things that could eventually lead us to wrongdoing. The Quran provides examples for our prayers. The following prayers touch upon many worthwhile aspirations: My Lord, increase me in knowledge. (20:114) My Lord, enable me to be grateful for Your favor which You have bestowed upon me and my parents and to work righteousness of which You will approve and make righteous for me my offspring.\nIndeed, I have repented to You, and indeed, I am of those who submit to You. (46:15) Our Lord! Pour out on us patience and constancy, and make us die as those who have surrendered themselves unto You. (7:126) And do not disgrace me on the day they are [all] resurrected, the day when there will not benefit [anyone] wealth or children, but only one who comes to Allah with a sound heart. 26:87-89 Our Lord! Grant us good in this world and good in the life to come and keep us safe from the torment of the Fire (2:201).\nCourtesy of the TIES Center, whose mission is to empower Kuwait\u2019s expats through social and educational services that promote a positive and productive role in society, and to facilitate opportunities for intra- and interfaith interactions that promote social solidarity.

(AP) Marcus Mariota and the Tennessee Titans have yet to set an official timetable for the quarterback\u2019s return from surgery on his right leg. The latest benchmark is reporting for the start of the offseason program.\nThe third-year quarterback now will finish his recovery from the season-ending injury at team headquarters after doing much of his rehabilitation at the University of Oregon this offseason.\n\u201dIt\u2019s important to be here, because together, you\u2019re building the foundations that you\u2019re going to use throughout the entire year,\u201d Mariota said Monday. \u201dYou\u2019re building the chemistry and the camaraderie that\u2019s going to make this team successful. I\u2019m happy to be here, and I\u2019m excited to be here. I\u2019m sure all the guys are.\u201d\nMariota broke his right fibula on Christmas Eve in a loss at Jacksonville and had surgery a few days later. That started the recovery process that the Titans initially said would take up to five months. Mariota spent the first two months in a cast.\n\u201dIt\u2019s kind of building those foundations back up, and I think we\u2019re in a good place,\u201d Mariota said. \u201dI understand that I\u2019ve got a lot of time to get my body right, and that\u2019s my goal.\u201d\nNext up is running full-speed, something he hopes to do within the next three weeks.\n\u201dThere are things where that have allowed me to push the envelope a little bit whether it\u2019s jogging or doing some other stuff on the treadmills, and things like that,\u201d Mariota said. \u201dFor me, that\u2019s my next benchmark.\u201d\nCoach Mike Mularkey, still in a walking boot himself following his own foot surgery this offseason, said Mariota appears to be ahead of schedule.\n\u201dYou would not know he\u2019s had the extent of the injury he has had,\u201d Mularkey said. \u201dHe\u2019s doing good. He\u2019s on track. I\u2019m not going to forecast when he\u2019s going to start doing normal functional exercises, but he\u2019s doing good. He\u2019s ahead of schedule, but I\u2019m not going to put a timeline out there.\u201d\nMariota walked without a limp when he talked to reporters Monday. He has even thrown with running back DeMarco Murray.\n\u201dWe\u2019ve been able to throw a couple of times, and he looks good,\u201d Murray said. \u201dObviously it\u2019s not 11-on-11. But just running routes on air, he looks good to me. He\u2019s putting it where it should be.\u201d\nMariota had a strong second season in the NFL, helping the Titans go 9-7 . He threw for 26 touchdowns and only nine interceptions with a 95.6 passer rating.\nFor Mariota, this marked the first significant injury of his football career. Staying positive played a big role in his recovery so far, especially when he was stuck in a cast and couldn\u2019t walk around.\n\u201dI was just focused on what I could do and how I could get better every day. Again, I just progressed through as I got from one step to the next, and it felt good. You felt like you were accomplishing things. I\u2019m doing everything in my power to get healthy, and I\u2019m going to continue to do that up till the season.\u201d\nNOTES: Only two players failed to show up for the first day of the voluntary offseason workout program, including 2015 Heisman Trophy winner Derrick Henry, one of the Titans\u2019 second-round picks a year ago. Cornerback Bennett Okotcha was the other absentee. Mularkey said that is the player\u2019s choice. Mularkey said the Titans have had coaches in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and he has seen video of Henry in the weight room. \u201dSo he is absolutely working out,\u201d Mularkey said.\n\u2014\nFor more NFL coverage: http:\/\/www.pro32.ap.org and http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/AP-NFL."}

Luther Strange, appointed back in February to fill the seat of now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions; and Rep. Mo Brooks, who's seized on an anti-McConnell platform as the president's attacks against the Senate's top Republican have intensified recently.\nMoore has consistently polled atop the field, and looks likely to claim a spot in a probable September runoff. His ads sound downright Trumpian, promising to \"drain the swamp\" and taking a swipe at D.C. elites.\nMoore is well-known throughout the state \u2014 and the country \u2014 too. He first gained national notoriety when he refused to remove a monument of the Ten Commandments from a state judicial building despite a federal court order; Moore himself was then removed from his position as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court in 2003. He won election to the same post again in 2012, but was then suspended after he ordered judges to enforce the state's ban on same-sex marriage despite the Supreme Court's 2015 decision in favor of gay marriage nationwide under the federal Constitution. He resigned earlier this year to challenge Strange.\nTo state observers, it's not surprising that Moore has been able to build a strong following and even expand beyond what might be his typical conservative base in the state.\n\"Alabama voters supported Trump because he spoke his mind and said all the things they had been thinking about government,\" said Brent Buchanan, a GOP strategist and pollster in the state. \"Out of all the candidates, Roy Moore has some of those similar characteristics. You may not agree with all of his policy or personal preferences, but you know that Roy Moore is going to do what Roy Moore believes.\"\nThat's why it was so, well, strange last week when Trump tweeted out his support for Strange, saying the incumbent has his \"complete and total endorsement!\"\nThe senator has benefited from millions of dollars in ads from the McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund super PAC. The very next day after endorsing Strange, Trump started going on Twitter tirades against the GOP Senate leader for failing to pass a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\nStrange has tried to prove his loyalty to the president ever since he was appointed under less than auspicious circumstances. As Alabama's attorney general, Strange was investigating then-Gov. Robert Bentley for misuse of his office amid a sex scandal when Bentley chose Strange to replace Sessions. Facing impeachment, Bentley eventually resigned, and the new governor, Kay Ivey, moved up the date for the special election to replace Sessions long-term.\nPolling done in the wake of Trump's surprise endorsement showed that the president's blessing had done little \u2014 yet \u2014 to move the needle toward Strange. One by cygnal, Buchanan's firm, conducted partly after the endorsement, showed Moore still with a lead and high favorables, Strange remained static and it was Brooks who took a hit.\nBuchanan said the Trump endorsement could help Strange turn out some who were less likely to vote on Tuesday, which could be key in what's already expected to be a very low-turnout affair.\nAnd the pro-Trump America First Action super PAC also announced late Friday it would be spending up to $200,000 on digital ads targeting Trump voters to encourage them to come out for Strange.\nHowever, although he's slipping in polling, Brooks is hoping to turn McConnell's fervent support for Strange into a last-ditch way to get into the likely runoff against Moore. He's hitched a \"Ditch Mitch\" banner to his campaign bus in the final days, and in his closing ad he echoes Trump's frustration with McConnell's inability to push through an Obamacare repeal.\n\"McConnell and Strange are weak, but together we can be strong,\" Brooks says. \"Mr. President, isn't it time we tell McConnell and Strange, 'You're fired?'\"\nUltimately, the Huntsville-area congressman hasn't had the resources the other two candidates have had, and he hasn't been elected statewide before like Moore and Strange. And, perhaps most damaging, he was certainly no fan of Trump during the GOP presidential primaries last year, during which he supported Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. McConnell's super PAC has pointed that out in ads, saying Brooks sided with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.\nIf Strange does fall short of the runoff, University of Alabama political science professor emeritus William Stewart, a longtime political observer in the state, said that's a big problem for McConnell. And, if Strange does make it to the likely September runoff, expect that to be a big point Moore can use against Strange, too.\n\"The McConnell support for Strange will not be helpful because McConnell, as the president says, hasn't been successful at pushing through the president's agenda, \" Stewart said. \"If Strange doesn't make the runoff, that's a definite blow to McConnell,\" more so than Trump.\nPolling shows Moore is still the favorite against Strange in a runoff, and that's where the McConnell ties could be the most deadly \u2014 and place the president in a more precarious spot given his surprising endorsement. Stewart said it would be interesting to watch how much Trump puts his muscle behind Strange later, and something like traveling to Alabama \u2014 one of Trump's best states in 2016 \u2014 for a rally on the senator's behalf would certainly give Strange a boost.\nNo matter who wins the GOP nomination though, they'll be the heavy favorite in the December general election, even if it's the more controversial Moore. Democrats are expected to nominate Doug Jones, a former U.S. attorney, though he could face a runoff against the aptly-named Robert Kennedy Jr., a Naval veteran who is not related to the famous Democratic political family.\nIf Moore is the GOP nominee, it will be interesting to watch whether the Democrats can make it even a mildly competitive contest \u2014 something Stewart, the former University of Alabama professor, said is doubtful, and is emblematic of the problems the party faces overall in the South.\n\"Right now the Democratic Party is very impotent here,\" Stewart said. \"I think whomever the Republicans choose as their nominee will be the winner.\""}

Bush\u2019s strategy of handling criticism over Hurricane Katrina, former White House press secretary Dana Perino argues that \u201cwhat President Trump is doing is definitely smarter politically.\u201d\nDuring the most recent episode of \u201cThe Jamie Weinstein Show\u201d podcast, Perino juxtaposed Bush\u2019s style with Donald Trump\u2019s more combative approach to handling criticism\u2014as recently seen when he attacked the mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico.\nBush, conversely, declined to call attention to the failures of Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco and New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin, instead, as Perino describes, telling them: \u201cI\u2019m willing to take the blame if you can agree to let me let the military in.\u201d\nThis dovetails what Karl Rove told me in 2011 about Katrina. The media wrongly \u201cassumed the federal government was in charge,\u201d he said. \u201cTo reduce the blame game, he deliberately took more on his shoulders than he probably should have.\u201d\nSo why did he do this? \u201cHe is his father\u2019s son,\u201d Perino said of President George W. Bush. And his mother\u2019s son. This is what they demanded.\u201d\nCompare Bush\u2019s noblesse oblige childhood with Donald Trump\u2019s more Nietzschean upbringing. Fred Trump raised his son to be a \u201ckiller\u201d and a \u201cking.\u201d If you ever wondered why candidates like Marco Rubio seemed constitutionally incapable of playing the same lowbrow game as Trump, it\u2019s probably because they were trained from an early age to comport themselves a certain way. These values get hardwired. Trump has no such disadvantage. Acting vulgar came across as strained and beneath him when Marco Rubio dabbled in it; for Trump, nothing could be more comfortable or authentic.\nGeorge W. Bush\u2019s penchant for turning the other cheek transcended his own words, impacting how his surrogates responded. \u201cEven I at the White House podium,\u201d Perino says, \u201cI always turned the other cheek because I knew he was watching.\u201d\nPerino says she had the same sort of parental training in modesty as her former boss: \u201cThat you were too big for your britches ...that was the phrase that you never want to hear about yourself.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I could make it in politics today,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause you kind of have to be too big for your britches\u2014or, at least, in whatever phase we are going through politically.\u201d\n\u201cWe were too willing to turn the other cheek,\u201d she continued, speaking of the Bush administration. \u201cIt\u2019s how we were raised. It\u2019s how he wanted the White House to be represented. But politically, if we had fought back more, I think that his approval rating probably would have held better. And it is possible that additional pieces of legislation that he wanted to get done could have been achieved\u2014in particular, immigration reform.\u201d\nTrump is a symptom, not a cause. The fact that blaming others gets you ahead is a commentary on our society. And his success will spawn imitators. Because people respond to incentives, what this means is that we are now systemically rewarding bad behavior\u2014and will get more of it. Economist F.A. Hayek said that in a totalitarian regime, the worst get on top. Our political process now seems to be following a similar formula.\nThis seems to be the new normal, and maybe GOP voters are simply recognizing that reality, not endorsing it. They would argue that Trump was able to beat Hillary Clinton precisely because he was a fighter. Perhaps this is what it takes to overcome the Democratic machine and the liberal media in the 21st century?\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

The service that converts tax refunds to the merchandise credits is offered by online filing service Turbo Tax and is known as monetizing.\nLlanes, through an interpreter, told U.S. District Judge Mark Hornak that he didn't realize at first that the shipments were part of an illegal scheme.\n\"I simply accepted a job to make some extra money,\" Llanes said. But Llanes acknowledged learning, at some point, that the refunds and shipments were accomplished using stolen tax information from U.S. citizens, according to his federal public defender, Thomas Livingston.\nMelucci said the larger investigation into the hacking and filing of the tax returns is ongoing.\nAccording to the indictment, Llanes and at least three others who have not been publicly identified were part of a group who used the hospital employees' information to collect phony tax refunds. After the credits were used to buy the easily re-sellable electronics, they were shipped by others based in Miami to people like Llanes in Venezuelan cities, including Maracay and Maracaibo. The items were re-shipped to make them harder to trace.\nThose in Venezuela then sold the devices through online merchants or auction sites or kept them for personal use. Llanes received an unspecified payment for his role, Melucci said.\nUPMC's computers were hacked in January 2014, and at least 939 bogus returns were filed in the next couple of months. The scheme was halted after almost $1.5 million of the $2.2 million in refunds sought through the bogus tax returns had been paid out with about $885,000 of the refunds being monetized through the Turbo Tax\/Amazon.com system, Melucci told the judge.\nUPMC is a 21-hospital network with thousands of doctors and dominates western Pennsylvania. UPMC officials said as 27,000 of its 62,000 employees lost personal information to the hackers.\nAs part of his eventual sentence, Llanes has agreed to forfeit more than $696,000 in unredeemed Amazon gift credits.\nLlanes faces up to 20 years in prison for the money laundering charge and a mandatory two years tacked onto that for the identity theft charge when he's sentenced Aug. 18.\nWHAT FEDS SAY HAPPENED\n\u2022University of Pittsburgh Medical Center computers hacked in 2014\n\u2022939 bogus tax returns filed in next few months\n\u2022$1.5 million in bogus tax returns paid out\n\u2022One defendant pleads guilty Monday"}

The 19 year-old rising star from Scotland had just come off the stage after performing at SnowGlobe Music Festival. Young, but undeniably impressive, he signed a deal with XL recordings. That means Radiohead, Kaytranada and Adele are among his label mates.\nWe sat down with him to talk bagpipes, Soundcloud, and jazz. The conversation went like this:\nYou are from Stirling, Scotland. Do you think that growing up there helped influence you sound?\nSam Gellaitry: 100%. The fact is that there isn\u2019t much of a music scene there. When I started, my brother was using this software because he had this hobby of doing this really hard-style house music. He was putting a Capella over it. This was when I was 10 and he was 15, just mucking around. That was on our family laptop, so I started just messing around with it and sampling tracks on YouTube. I was really into French House.\nWith the help of the internet, I was able to have all of the world\u2019s music. I was able to explore it and do it by myself and really develop a unique path is music as well. Even now, man, I\u2019ve seen recently when all of this stuff happened to me, a lot of people are really focusing on making music which is amazing. But before no one was doing it. So I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve inspired the people back home and stuff, but back in the day it was literally just me. It\u2019s a lovely place too, man. The scenery and everything, it all adds to the inspiration and stuff.\nSoundcloud has definitely helped you in your success. What do you think of the current state of the service? There is a lot of things going on with copyright and songs being taken down.\nSam: I just got an official remix taken down and it\u2019s the on same label that I\u2019m on. It\u2019s just like, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I think literally I was one of the final people to really embrace how good it was at the time. But then again, it just went.\nI think it\u2019s just too cluttered and that happens to a lot of things. There just, like, is not really a quality control. It\u2019s just a lot of feed. There is no real excitement, I\u2019d say. As in, the excitement of the search for things and to know there\u2019s things that you can find. It\u2019s just hard to navigate it these days because there is so much stuff.\nOf course people like to talk about your age [19] and how you\u2019re young in the game. Do you think that has helped or hindered your success, being young and coming up on the scene?\nSam: It\u2019s kinda done both, man. I don\u2019t want to be known for my age because that\u2019s not what it\u2019s about, but it\u2019s nice to be complimented on like, an early achievement, if you know what I mean. It\u2019s nice to be in the same category of people who are a little bit older. I\u2019m not like really used to that. I usually hang out with people that are the same age and all that stuff. Being able to, not even compete because there is not competition in music, but to be in the same category is really a big compliment to me. To be able to surprise people by my age is kind of nice as well. I mean, I don\u2019t want to be known just for that.\nI was reading up on you. I found out that your dad at one point had a hobby of making bagpipes?\nSam: That\u2019s his business man. It\u2019s a hobby, but he still does it seriously. That\u2019s like his trade. He has another job, but he hand makes bagpipes basically at our house.\nDid your parents guide you to do music?\nSam: I mean, having the laptop at such a young age was really helpful. Because back then, normally people didn\u2019t have computers like that. They didn\u2019t really encourage me to do it, it\u2019s just something that I kind of found I really liked. It took a long time for me to really like what I was hearing and really have a musical grip, in a sense.\nA lot of the earlier stuff is just complete experimentation, but going back to it makes sense in the timeline and stuff. No one around me was going, \u201cAre you really good at music?\u201d because it was so different to what people were used to. So that\u2019s another good thing about Stirling. They\u2019ve seen me doing all of the weird stuff and then asking, \u201cWhat is all of this?\u201d As soon as my music got a little bit of success, it was just kind of like, \u201cOh. Wow.\u201d\nDo your parents like your music?\nSam: Yeah. They do. My real passion is the jazz element and stuff, old influences. I started music basically through French House which is derivative of disco. So all of those elements are really what I like. If I make a track, I\u2019ll show them the ones that I make that are not necessarily easy listening, but more understandable to an older person. And they really like that stuff. The orchestral stuff is in my music too, and they appreciate that.\nThere\u2019s going to be more like \u2013 ah shoot \u2013 what\u2019s the word, what\u2019s the word? Emphasis! On the jazz and hip-hop. I\u2019m working on album now, so that\u2019s going to be definitely centered on that style.\nWhen can we expect that?\nSam: I dunno. I\u2019ve got Escapism III coming out in two months so I\u2019m excited to release that. But that\u2019s cool as well because I have like a trilogy. I\u2019m going to have it as a box set and throw in bonus tracks and shit.\nHow do you balance the sort of dreamier aspects to your music with the sort of heavier hitting drops, if you wanted to call them that?\nSam: No, I would say there are drops in my music. I try and make the contrast hearable, but not obviously too intense. I\u2019ll try and push it a little bit by making it really solid, but not too hard. The bass has to be there and all that stuff. I don\u2019t want like, EHH EHH EHH, you know what I mean?\nWhen I\u2019m doing my live sets too it\u2019s not just noise, it has like some kind of progression to it. It\u2019s all about ups and downs, man. Yah\u2019 can\u2019t have like, straight noise. And you can have chilled out stuff, but for the music it\u2019s nice to have contrast.\nHave you had any surreal music moments yet, like meeting your idols or playing some show?\nSam: I met Madlib in the first club I ever went and played in London. That was crazy. Shit. I just met Flying Lotus, too. He changed how I listen to music. He totally got me into jazz. And it\u2019s cool, because I used to love electronica and a lot of people would hear Flying Lotus from hip-hop and then get into the electronica side. They kind of helped me get into the hip-hop side, but I already really liked electronica. So I think that also helped influence how I got my sound and stuff. And Madlib kind of like recognized me and then heard my name. It was ridiculous, man.\nWhat\u2019s your current relationship with the Soulection crew?\nSam: Uhm. No comment.\nNo comment?\nSam: Nah. The Soulection crew are great but I\u2019m not like affiliated with them anymore. I love all of the artists there. Everyone\u2019s really nice but\u2026 I haven\u2019t like told anyone what happened, so\u2026 But nah, I mean there is no point in mentioning it. They are doing their own thing so it\u2019s all good.\nWhat\u2019s it like being on the huge XL lineup this year? I mean you\u2019ve got Zomby, the Avalanches, Radiohead.\nSam: Really good, man. It\u2019s very helpful and obviously it\u2019s amazing to be associated with such a legendary label. They have so many albums and just projects to their name, it\u2019s amazing.\nIf your music were a food, what would it be and why?\nSam: I want to say pistachios because they\u2019re addicting. Nah just kidding. Uh\u2026 Stir fry? This is an intense question. AHHHH. I\u2019ve got to make the right choice though. There is so much food. I can\u2019t answer that one I\u2019m so sorry.\nI\u2019ll go with pistachios because they are addictive.\nSam: Okay, okay.\nLast one, we are a college radio station so what would you say to young aspiring artists trying to do things like yourself?\nSam:\nDon\u2019t try to sound like anyone else. Try not to watch too many tutorials because then you are also trying to be like them. Just find your own way to navigate software without anyone else trying to tell you what to do.\nIt\u2019s the same with music. If you find a skill which suits you just like go with that and then find all of the rest on the way.\nThank you so much. If you ever come by San Luis Obispo, you\u2019ve got a place to stay.\nSam: Where is that?\nUh, it\u2019s in between San Francisco and LA, we are right in the middle near Santa Barbara.\nSam: Ah perfect.

But these days, maybe not so much.\nA growing number of singles are adding a clause to their online dating profiles telling either Trump haters or Trump supporters \u2014 depending on their political preference \u2014 that they need not apply.\n\"This was like a deal breaker for me,\" says 50-year-old Elizabeth Jagosz from the Detroit area. \"If you are Trump supporter, I'm not even going to consider meeting you for coffee.\"\nIt's not just an issue of party politics, Jagosz says. It's about core values. Love, she says, cannot conquer all.\n\"If you don't care about a person who says you can grab women by the pussy and that's OK \u2014 I don't wanna date you if you think that behavior's OK,\" Jagosz says. \"If that's not a deal breaker for you, then you and I have nothing to talk about.\"\nAs another single put it in her profile, \"Red hats need not apply.\"\nBut the people wearing those red hats \u2014 the ones stamped with \"Make America Great Again\" \u2014 have been feeling the same way.\nThis lack of desire from liberals and conservatives to date each other is what David Goss says prompted him to launch TrumpSingles.com.\n\"Yeah, it's both ways,\" Goss says. \"You know, like a liberal doesn't want to date a Nazi. And a republican doesn't want to date, well, a whiny snowflake, and that's what they're viewing each other as.\"\nTrumpSingles.com is a kind of safe space for Trump supporters who say they're sick of the \"lefties\" refusing to even give them a chance.\n\"[The liberals] are just repeating this left echo chamber of 'Oh, you must be a racist; oh, you must be a homophobe; oh, you must be a misogynist,' \" Goss says. \"They're judging the people based on who they voted for without actually getting to know them.\"\nHelen Fisher, the chief scientific adviser to the Internet dating website Match.com, says new research from the website shows both liberals and conservatives are moving away from the center of the political spectrum.\n\"There's a real distinct difference that we're seeing today, and all singles are becoming more rigid in their views,\" she says.\nThe data also shows that singles are more likely now to shun those who are at the other end of the political spectrum. And liberals are more likely to spurn conservatives than the other way around.\n\"I think it's very natural to the human animal to bring it into the idea of 'OK, you like this person, well, you must be like that person then,' \" Fisher says. \"America is taking this very, very personally. No question about it.\"\nLooking back now, it seems almost unfathomable that even two opposing campaign advisers could cross the aisle and then actually walk down the aisle as James Carville and Mary Matalin did in 1993.\nAs Carville famously put it once, \"You can love the sinner and hate the sin.\"\nThe couple says their secret to survival and harmony at home is simply agreeing to disagree.\nBut today, singles seem to be saying they just can't do that.\n\"I mean, I wish I could just go out and tell everyone to knock it off and be cool with each other, but it's just not going to work that way,\" Goss says.\nHis Trump Singles dating site is up to 35,000 members. LiberalHearts.com, founded by Salvatore Prano, is up to nearly 50,000.\n\"There's more activity now than ever,\" Prano says. \"I knew liberals would only find comfort in each other's arms.\"\nBut there is one other option for lonely liberals. Single Joe Goldman founded MapleMatch.com, a dating site that helps Americans find Canadians \"to save them from the unfathomable horror of a Trump presidency.\" Goldman became his own first client.\n\"I can't tell you the sinking feeling I felt [after the election],\" he says. \"That's not the country I want to live in. So why not consider places that might be more in line with my values, like Canada.\"\nIt may be better than the alternative. According to the new Match.com survey, a growing number of liberals today are simply choosing to not date at all."}

(FULL TEXT OF STATEMENT BOTTOM)\nObasanjo\u2019s outspoken comments come against a backdrop of growing discontent at Buhari\u2019s stewardship of Africa\u2019s most populous nation, which since 2015 has suffered recession and a slew of security concerns.\nBuhari\u2019s own wife, Aisha, has herself appeared to align herself with his critics by retweeting videos of opposition lawmakers lambasting the government\u2019s performance in office.\nWith polls approaching in February 2019, it is Obasanjo\u2019s comments that have caused alarm within the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\nObasanjo, who headed a military government in the 1970s and was Nigeria\u2019s first president when civilian rule was restored in 1999, said Buhari needed a \u201cdeserved rest\u201d.\nHis former army comrade had proved weak on the economy and foreign affairs, and had a \u201cpoor understanding\u201d of Nigeria\u2019s complex internal politics, he suggested.\nTo ask increasingly divided and embattled Nigerians to vote for him again was \u201cunrealistic,\u201d Obasanjo argued.\nIt \u201cwill only sentence Nigeria to a prison term of four years, if not destroy it beyond the possibility of an early recovery and substantial growth\u201d, he added.\n\u2013 \u2018Dignified dismount\u2019 \u2013\nBuhari, 75, spent most of last year receiving treatment in London for an unspecified illness, leading many to wonder whether he is fit enough to serve another four-year term.\nIn 2015, he became the first opposition candidate in Nigerian history to unseat an incumbent, defeating Goodluck Jonathan at the polls.\nObasanjo, now 80 and still an influential political figure, ripped up his membership card of Jonathan\u2019s ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) just before the last election.\nHe claimed Jonathan was trying to stay in power \u201cby hook or by crook\u201d, questioned his fitness to govern and said he was surrounded by corrupt cronies and \u201cgreedy hangers-on\u201d.\nBut despite initially giving his backing to Buhari, he said his performance had not delivered the change he promised three years ago.\nThere had been a lack of progress in tackling poverty, improving governance and, while Boko Haram Islamists had been weakened, new security threats had emerged, he said.\nHe acknowledged some progress in fighting corruption but said there was nepotism \u201cbordering on clannishness\u201d in Buhari\u2019s administration, in a clear reference to his inner circle.\nAisha Buhari has similarly criticised the so-called \u201ccabal\u201d around her husband, suggesting they held the real power.\nObasanjo said Buhari\u2019s \u201cplace in history is already assured\u201d and called for a new \u201ccoalition for democracy, good governance, social and economic well-being and progress\u201d.\n\u201cPresident Buhari needs a dignified and honourable dismount from the horse,\u201d he said, suggesting he could still play a role from the sidelines with other former leaders.\n\u2013 Political operator \u2013\nPolitical analysts sensed calculation on the part of Obasanjo, a canny operator whose backing has been seen as essential to get ahead in Nigeria\u2019s patronage politics.\nCommentator Chris Ngwodo said the former head of state had \u201cread the groundswell of discontent\u201d with Buhari, just as he did with Jonathan in 2015.\n\u201cAt the very least\u201d, his comments will see an erosion of the overwhelming support that brought Buhari to power, he said.\nCheta Nwanze, head of research at the Lagos-based advisory firm SBM Intelligence, said Obasanjo\u2019s statement \u201cwill do a lot of damage to Buhari\u2019s second-term ambition\u201d.\n\u201cMany who were hitherto afraid to speak out will find their voices and there will be a realignment,\u201d he told AFP.\n\u201cIf the security services move against Obasanjo it places Buhari in an even poorer light.\u201d\nBoth Ngwodo and Nwanze identified the former Kano state governor Rabiu Kwankwaso and the current governor of Sokoto, Aminu Tambuwal, as possible challengers to Buhari.\nKwankwaso came third in the APC presidential primary last time round behind Buhari and Obasanjo\u2019s former vice-president Atiku Abubakar.

Bryant, along with his resignation for the company\u2019s failure to disclose that beef is present in some of its cereals and to recall all such products from the market.\nRajan Zed, president of Universal Society of Hinduism in Reno, released a statement Saturday to express shock for Hindus who are just now learning that some of the cereals and other Kellogg\u2019s products they eat because the ingredients labeled on the boxes or packages have no mention of beef.\nConsumption of beef is highly conflicting to Hindu beliefs, Zed said. Cow, the seat of many deities, is sacred and has long been venerated in Hinduism, he said.\nA response from Kellogg Consumer Affairs for an enquiry received on August 12 via email, however, admitted that gelatin, derived from beef, is found in all varieties of Kellogg\u2019s Frosted Pop-Tarts, Kellogg\u2019s Frosted Mini-Wheats cereal and Kellogg\u2019s Rice Krispies Treats cereal. Other Kellogg\u2019s foods that contain gelatin that is derived from either beef or pork include all Kellogg\u2019s fruit flavored snacks and Kellogg\u2019s Krave Treat Bars, according to the announcement.\n\u201cIt was a very serious issue for the devotees and would severely hurt their feelings when they would come to know that they were unknowingly eating beef-laced popular cereals and other Kellogg\u2019s products,\u201d Zed said in the press release.\nKellogg\u2019s Frosted Mini-Wheats cereal was reportedly introduced in 1969, he said. Kellogg\u2019s did not mention beef clearly under the ingredients on the boxes or packages when it was part of the product inside.\nIntegrity and accountability are listed as company values on the Kellogg\u2019s website, Zed said.\n\u201cNow was the time for Kellogg\u2019s to demonstrate its \u2018commitment to integrity and ethics\u2019 by admitting their error of not being transparent enough to mention in clear and simple terms what was inside the box\/package so that an ordinary consumer could make right and appropriate choices,\u201d Zed said.\nWill Keith Kellogg founded Kellogg\u2019s in 1906 and it is now headquartered in Battle Creek, Mich., with Kellogg India based in Mumbai. Kellogg\u2019s claims to be the world\u2019s leading cereal company with more than 1,600 foods and sales of $13 billion in 2016."}

We know what\u2019s at stake and I know I had to come up with the trump card today,\u201d said the Jamaican, the hero of successive Twenty20 World Cup finals in 2012 and 2016.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in the [same] situation many times and pulled it off so it\u2019s the same mindset. I don\u2019t really focus on the noise around me. I keep watching the scoreboard and trying to tick it over as much as possible and play the situation and try to stay ahead of the game.\u201d\nSamuels, who struck six fours and four commanding sixes, was supported by Shai Hope who stroked a polished 76 and aggressive opener Evin Lewis who carved out 64.\nHowever, it was in partnership with Hope that Samuels shone, adding 135 for the third wicket, to put West Indies in sight of victory.\nSamuels said the partnership had been a fulfilling one, not only because of its value to the innings but also because he enjoyed watching the 24-year-old Hope.\n\u201cHe is one of my favourite batsmen so he\u2019s definitely one for the future that we should look out for. He has a lot of special knocks to come,\u201d Samuels noted.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to bat with him because he\u2019s a guy that listens to me, and we were just having a coversation in the middle that we were having off the field, so it\u2019s much better in the situation that we could talk and actually make it happen.\u201d\nWest Indies almost made a hash of the run chase, however. After being well-positioned on 245 for two in the 44th over, Samuels\u2019 dismissal \u2013 caught behind off 21-year-old speedster Blessing Muzarabani \u2013 triggered a collapse which saw four wicket tumble for 20 runs.\nRovman Powell (15 not out) and Ashley Nurse (8 not out) eventually saw the Windies home but Samuels said he believed he had let his side down by getting out when he did.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t happy because I actually left it up to the rest of my teammates which I didn\u2019t want to \u2026 so I was pretty upset,\u201d he lamented.\n\u201cI was even still in my pads but the end of the day, we crossed the line.

It includes US motorcycles, denim, cigarettes, cranberry juice and peanut butter.\nThe EU-US talks come just one day after the Trump administration's surprise announcement that it would impose tariffs on about $50 billion worth of Chinese goods and restrict Chinese investment in the United States.\nThe shock move followed intensive negotiations between both sides, and an agreement to put a hold on threatened tariffs while talks progressed.\nRelated: China says it's ready to fight back after US revives tariffs\nExperts said it's exceedingly difficult to forecast the outcome of the US-EU talks.\n\"The way the United States has dealt with trade policy, it's so difficult to predict what will happen,\" said Ross Denton, a trade expert and partner at law firm Baker McKenzie.\nDenton said the European Union has a strong case for exemptions from the steel and aluminum tariffs, which were imposed in the name of national security. But the Trump administration may not agree.\n\"I don't see any particular benefit to the Trump administration to, frankly, pissing the European Union off,\" Denton said.\nRelated: Why are US cranberries repeatedly threatened with tariffs?\nThe American Chamber of Commerce to the European Union -- which represents US companies in the region -- called on the Trump administration to show restraint.\n\"These [US] tariff proposals could ignite a dangerous escalation in trade disputes and could also have other unintended consequences. They could have significant implications for jobs, growth and security on both sides of the Atlantic,\" it said in a statement.\nThe European Union said it would respond in a \"proportionate\" way in order to avoid a trade war. But President Donald Trump may not see it that way.\nTrump had previously threatened to respond to any new EU trade barriers with a tax on vehicles made by European carmakers.\nRoss has already launched an investigation into whether global automobile imports are hurting US national security. The administration used this same approach before announcing the steel and aluminum tariffs.\nA tariff on cars and auto parts would have a damaging impact on American drivers and global automakers.\nRelated: Trump's on-again, off-again strategy on China may backfire\nRelations between the United States and European Union have also been strained over Iran.\nEuropean businesses were recently burned by Trump's decision to reimpose wide-reaching sanctions on Iran, forcing some to wind down their operations in the country. The move affected billions of dollars worth of business deals.\nThe European Union reacted by introducing measures designed to defy the US sanctions and protect the interests of its businesses.\n-- Alice McCool and Chris Liakos contributed reporting."}

Prior to this clarification, many pot companies had largely focused on markets outside of the U.S. or listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange, which is less risk-averse.\nSince then, some Canadian pot companies have shifted to exchanges other than the Toronto Stock Exchange or reduced their U.S. exposure.\nLicensed producer Aphria Inc. had aggressively pursued a U.S. expansion strategy, but earlier this year it was looking to reduce its direct investments in the U.S. The Leamington, Ont.-based company\u2019s recent moves include a deal announced in February to sell part of its stake in U.S.-focused marijuana company Liberty Health Sciences, which is listed on the CSE.\nMeanwhile, in January, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded an Obama-era memo that suggested that the federal government would not intervene in states where marijuana is legal, though U.S. President Donald Trump later gave Colorado senator assurances that the recission would not impact its legal pot industry. Still, other American politicians are warming up to cannabis, with New York governor Andrew Cuomo creating a task force to consider whether or not to propose legalizing marijuana for recreational use.\nAustralis is applying to list its shares and warrants on the CSE, Aurora said Wednesday.\n\u201cRecent changes in U.S. federal positioning with respect to cannabis have positively impacted the perception of risk to invest in U.S. cannabis assets,\u201d the Edmonton-based company said in a statement. \u201cThis has further incentivized capital market participants to seek opportunities to fund U.S. based operations.\u201d\nAurora shareholders who reside in Canada will receive the shares at no cost to them while non-resident shareholders of Aurora will receive cash, net of withholding taxes, instead of equity in Australis.\nAustralis intends to issue 75 million shares at 20 cents each through a private placement for gross proceeds of $15 million.\nAustralis also receives $500,000 from Aurora, as advance payment for warrants to buy Australis stock for up to 10 years."}

With her latest installment, called \"The Wall of Shamed,\" the artist is creating a powerful platform for women to anonymously open up about their experiences.\nLocated at the Victorian College of the Arts Masters Graduate Exhibition in Melbourne, Australia, Blake's installment is filled with derogatory comments made to women by their peers, boyfriends, husbands, and strangers. As a result, \"The Wall of Shamed\" reveals the deep emotional scars that body shaming and sexual harassment can leave on women. Some of the comments were directed at girls as young as seven.\n\"The man who raped me when I was fourteen told me I had 'charging rhinoceros thighs',\" recalls one victim; another writes that after shaving her hair, \"I was told boys would like me better with long hair.\"\n\"Women and girls are shamed throughout their lives for not living up to patriarchally prescribed ideals of 'womanliness',\" Blake writes on her website. \"Body shaming. Fat shaming. Slut shaming. Period shaming. Mother shaming. Food shaming. Gender shaming. Victim shaming.

Carly participated in a study suggesting that the drug lonafarnib may extend life for children with progeria, a rare, incurable disease that causes rapid aging. Other kids \"always think I'm a baby,\" Carly says. But \"I'm a regular kid.\" (Heidi Bisbee via AP)\nCHICAGO (AP) - Children with a rare, incurable disease that causes rapid aging and early death may live longer if treated with an experimental drug first developed for cancer patients, a study suggests.\nThe small, preliminary study isn't proof the drug works and it found only a small benefit: Treated children with the disease progeria were more likely than others to survive during the two-year study. But some kids taking the drug in this and other studies have lived into their late teens. Researchers and others say the results suggest a potential breakthrough for a heartbreaking condition that typically kills kids before they reach adulthood.\n\"Anything we can do to try to provide them hope of a longer life is well worth doing and well worth celebrating,\" said Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, who was not part of the new study. A geneticist, Collins led laboratory experiments that in 2003 identified the genetic basis for the disease, formally known as Hutchinson-Gilford progeria.\nAmong 27 children with progeria who got the drug lonafarnib, one died during the 2007-2010 study. That's compared with nine of 27 untreated children with the disease. Thirteen of the treated children are still alive; most began taking other experimental drugs too.\n\"For the first time ever we have a drug that is shown to extend lifespan for children with progeria,\" said lead author Dr. Leslie Gordon of Brown University. Her son was a study participant and died in 2014 at age 17.\nThe results were published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\nThe study, conducted at Boston Children's Hospital, was unusually designed, comparing children given the drug with other progeria patients worldwide who weren't enrolled in the study. The untreated kids were matched as closely as possible with study participants by age, gender and other characteristics, but they weren't a standard control group and didn't receive dummy medication.\nThat design weakens the study conclusions, said Dr. Howard Worman, a Columbia University biologist. \"You really cannot say anything 'worked' without a contemporary placebo control.\"\nThe children in the study were also involved in earlier research testing the same drug combined with two others. Within a period of about five years, survival was extended by about 19 months. It wasn't clear if all three drugs or just one or two of them contributed to the improvement. Lonafarnib also appeared to reduce blood vessel damage.\nAverage life expectancy for progeria children is about 14 years. Though many die younger, usually from heart attacks or strokes, some lonafarnib-treated kids have lived to their late teens.\nFor parents, who want to see their children grow up, that sliver of extra time is a bittersweet blessing.\n\"If you're a mom and you're told that life expectancy is 13 years, that 1.6 years is gold,\" said Heather Unsinger. Her 7-year-old daughter, Carly, was a study participant and has been taking lonafarnib since age 3. \"But it's really hard to jump up and down.\"\nAffected children are typically small, bald and fragile-looking but intellectually normal. Carly \"has full-throttle dreams\" and envisions becoming an art teacher one day, her mom said.\nOther kids \"always think I'm a baby,\" Carly said. But \"I'm a regular kid.\"\nProgeria is caused by a mutation in a gene that regulates production of a protein that helps shape and support the nucleus of cells throughout the body. In normal aging, the protein accumulates in cells but in children with progeria, an abnormal buildup occurs that severely damages cells. Lonafarnib helps block that abnormal buildup.\nThe disease affects about 1 in 20 million people. It is a chance mutation and isn't inherited. Affected children are born looking healthy, but fail to grow normally, lose body fat and hair and develop aged-looking skin, stiff joints and diseased arteries.\nLonafarnib was initially developed as a potential cancer treatment but without much success. Schering Plough\/Merck supplied the study drug; the research was paid for by the Progeria Research Foundation.\nGordon, the lead author, and her husband, Dr. Scott Berns, started the foundation in 1999 after their son, Sam, was diagnosed. She is continuing to study lonafarnib and other drugs in kids with progeria.\nUniversity of Washington geneticist Dr. Fuki Hisama predicted that lonafarnib will eventually become standard treatment for progeria, though not a cure.\nThe study \"gives other people the message that there is hope for rare diseases,\" said Hisama, who wrote an accompanying journal editorial.\n___\nFollow AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner on Twitter at @LindseyTanner.

(Getty Images)\nMajor League Baseball will relax its uniform rules for a weekend later this season, allowing players to put nicknames on the back of their jerseys, wear fluorescent-colored shoes and personalize a patch paying tribute to someone instrumental in their development, according to a memo obtained by Yahoo Sports.\nThe event, called Players Weekend, is planned for Aug. 25-27 and was negotiated between the league and MLB Players Association. Players long have sought to express their personal style on the field and capitalize on the intersection of fashion and sports in a way other leagues don\u2019t allow, and the result will be a test of boundaries baseball may be inclined to stretch in the future depending on the weekend\u2019s success.\nPlayers will have the option to wear a jersey with a nickname \u2013 though they are limited to just one, according to the memo, and \u201cinappropriate or offensive\u201d nicknames will be banned.\nThe items with minimal color restrictions include spikes, batting gloves, wristbands, compression sleeves and catcher\u2019s masks.

{"id":"07b75d7a-6852-4824-8acb-8ebbe70fc2d1","text":"Each month this year, Globe writers will tell their tale of Canada: what its history, geography, peoples and culture mean in their lives.\nAs one of the earliest second-century Canadians \u2013 my parents missed Expo 67 because I came into the world a few weeks after Confederation entered the triple digits \u2013 I can\u2019t really be blamed for believing that everything changed 50 years ago. As well as a silver dollar and a futuristic emblem on my birth certificate, my status as a Centennial baby has accorded me an innate and perhaps exaggerated sense of the importance of that year in Canadian history. Yet to look back from Canada\u2019s 150th year is to realize that this feeling is not just solipsism: 1967 is the hinge upon which modern Canadian history turns and, in certain respects, the key to understanding the challenges of the next half-century.\nToday, we live in the country shaped by the decisions and transformations of 1967, far more than by the events of 1867. Anniversaries are usually symbolic moments of reflection, but Canada\u2019s hundredth was a very real bid to create an almost entirely new country, and, to a large extent, it succeeded. If you spend some time immersed in the Canada of a few years before 1967, and then in the Canada of a few years after, you feel like you\u2019ve visited two countries \u2013 the former still colonial, closed, dependent, paternalistic and pretending to be homogeneous, a place whose sleepy streets you\u2019d have to leave if you wanted to make something of yourself; the latter a country of self-invention and iconoclasm, a North American place whose several peoples began to build something much bigger, more complex, but also safer and more educated and urban, and something entirely their own.\nPierre Berton, the historian, famously referred to 1967 twenty years ago as \u201cThe Last Good Year\u201d \u2013 a book title that appealed to a nostalgic belief in a placid antediluvian Canada that even he admitted had never existed. The centennial euphoria, he argued, gave way in later years to \u201cthe very real fear that the country we celebrated so joyously \u2026 is in the process of falling apart.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a better way to express that thought: After the centennial, we started to confront seriously the schisms and divisions and gross inequities that had been masked before beneath a patina of colonial gloss. We would have, over the next 50 years, two secession crises, a battle over our North American economic identity and a hard-fought political reawakening of our indigenous nations. Yet, these were the crucial struggles of becoming a real country, of finding a governing mechanism and a common culture to bring together those long-disparate peoples.\nLet me make the case, then, that 1967 was Canada\u2019s first good year. We should spend this year celebrating not the 150th year of Confederation, but the 50th birthday of the new Canada.\nBut let me also make the case that our conventional story about the birth of second-century Canada is largely wrong. We like to believe that starting in the late 1960s, a series of political decisions, parliamentary votes, court rulings and royal commissions descended upon an innocent, paternalistic, resource-economy Canada and forced upon it an awkward jumble of novelties: non-white immigration, bilingualism, multiculturalism, refugees, indigenous nationhood, liberation of women and gays, the seeds of free trade, individual rights, religious diversity.\nA Nigerian family receive their Canadian citizenship at a ceremony in Kitchener, along with 32 other people from around the world, on Dec. 22. Glenn Lowson for The Globe and Mail\nBut the explosions of official novelty that were launched in and around 1967 weren\u2019t a cause; they were an effect of profound changes that had taken place in Canadians themselves during the two decades after the war, in their thinking and their composition and their attitude toward their country, in Quebec and English Canada and in indigenous communities.\nCanada was not remade by the decisions of 1967; it was reflected by them, for the first time. What began in 1967 was official Canada beginning to catch up with the real Canada. And that is also the lesson to be carried forward to 2017: Canadians tend to be ahead of their institutions, and every few decades it is time for a dramatic catching up, like the explosion of adjustment we saw in \u201867.\nA War of Symbols\nThe day I emerged from the womb, the hippies were rioting in Toronto\u2019s Yorkville district and Detroit was still smouldering. Vietcong MiGs and U.S. fighters were battling over Hanoi, and All You Need Is Love was the number-one single. It was a volatile and unpredictable moment.\nBut there were also a great many signs that day of the seismic plates shifting beneath Canada\u2019s festive surface. Consider the ripples of change that took place on the day of my birth, as the centennial bash roared on.\nEight hours after I was born, the directors of the Canadian National Exhibition filed into a banquet hall for their annual luncheon. The exhibition\u2019s president, W.H. Evans, asked them to remain standing to sing the national anthem \u2013 and then chaos ensued, as half the audience broke into God Save the Queen before the pianist had struck the first note of O Canada. A debate over Canada\u2019s true national anthem, begun in 1964, had been winding its way through a special House of Commons-Senate joint committee all year and filling the media with debate. It wouldn\u2019t fully be resolved until a law was passed in 1980, and many people (especially in Toronto) still considered the British national anthem \u201cofficial.\u201d\nNational symbols remained subjects of heated contention in 1967. The flag debate had officially been resolved two years earlier with the choice of the Maple Leaf, but defenders of the old colonial Red Ensign remained outspoken in Parliament, the press and even at Expo 67. Everything about the way Canada represented itself to the world was up for grabs.\nBut something deeper was taking place, involving not just the symbols but the realities they represented.\nThe postwar decades were defined by large-scale decolonization around the world: Across Africa, Asia and the Americas, scores of countries were freeing themselves from centuries of control by European masters, and struggling, sometimes violently, to find ways to represent and govern themselves as independent entities. People were learning to think of themselves not as colonial subjects but as autonomous individuals within self-created states.\nIn that light, 1967 can only be seen as the apex of Canada\u2019s postcolonial moment. The wars over symbols were one small manifestation of a larger shift.\nIt\u2019s worth remembering how new this all was. We still remained, in important ways, a colony. In 1967, Canadian citizenship had only existed for 20 years \u2013 before January 1, 1947, everyone in Canada was a British subject and had to travel with a United Kingdom passport. But it still didn\u2019t quite exist: That 1947 law creating Canadian citizenship declared in its main clause that \u201ca Canadian citizen is a British subject\u201d (this would remain in place until 1977).\nThat idea was still hotly defended by many in the Ottawa of 1967: The Progressive Conservative leadership still opposed Canadian citizenship, and the flag, and the anthem. There was still a sizable political faction in Canada who supported the idea that all Canadians were simply a slightly different, less important flavour of British people.\nBut the great majority of Canadians had moved on \u2013 or moved in \u2013 and you could see the centennial struggling to catch up with them.\nTwo, Three, Many Canadas\nThe morning of my birth, opposition leader John Diefenbaker (still sitting, anachronistically, in the House four years after his prime ministership had ended) denounced prime minister Lester B. Pearson for having declared the previous week that \u201cwe are a nation of two founding peoples\u201d (in French, the prime minister went further and called them \u201cnations\u201d).\nMr. Diefenbaker considered this a catastrophic blow to a country he had always insisted was purely British: \u201cAdoption of the two-nation concept,\u201d he explained to his fellow MPs that day, \u201cwould lead to the breakdown of confederation.\u201d But he was swimming against his own party\u2019s tide: a few days earlier, a Progressive Conservative policy conference had gone further than the Liberals by concluding that Canada should be seen as a federal state \u201ccomposed of two founding peoples (deux nations), with historic rights, who have been joined by people from many lands.\u201d\nIn other words: A hundred years into Confederation, the leader of the official opposition still did not seem to believe that French Canadians existed. The notion that Canada contained more than one language and people was still hotly contested in some circles.\nBut that era was ending fast. A day later, Ontario Premier John Robarts would announce that his province was to build a system of French-language secondary schools. This was not an act of expansive idealism: He was recognizing the reality of a population, including millions of Francophones outside of Quebec, who were no longer capable of seeing themselves, or their children, as subjects of a homogenizing foreign ruler.\nThese debates sprawled across Canada\u2019s newspapers and TV screens all year. Everyone taking part in them knew there was a looming transformation about to take place. There was a name for it: \u201cBi and Bi,\u201d the household name for the mammoth Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, the largest and most powerful government inquiry Canada had seen. It had been established by Mr. Pearson in 1963 to find a way to address growing Quebecois disenchantment with a Canada that tended to ignore its French fact, and was widely expected to endorse some version of the \u201ctwo nations\u201d model so hotly discussed that week.\nOn Oct. 8, 1967, it released its first report \u2013 a national event almost rivalling Expo in its media and political attention. And to the great surprise of many, the idea of Canada as two peoples and nations was not its most dramatic proposal \u2013 though it certainly did call for a fully bilingual country. That was expected. What was not expected was the very large part of the report, and the subsequent reports over the next two years, devoted to what the commission\u2019s original mandate had called \u201cOther Cultural Groups.\u201d People who were neither British nor French in identity or origin had become a significant share of the Canadian population during the 20th century.\nAnd while the commission was clear in calling for two official languages, it found a Canada that could no longer be described as having merely one or two or three founding \u201cpeoples,\u201d \u201cnations\u201d or \u201craces\u201d (a term still used to describe English and French communities in 1967). Its implication, not quite spelled out, was that Canada was becoming a place that could no longer be defined by its colonial origins.\nOver the next several years, that reality would become impossible to ignore. So that when, in 1971, prime minister Pierre Trudeau first used the word \u201cmulticulturalism\u201d to define Canadian policy, it was not simply a political ploy to defuse French-English rivalries and rising separatist sentiment (though it was certainly that). It was an inevitable, and perhaps even somewhat late, recognition of what Canada had already been for a long time.\nUnquiet Revolutions\nNew Year\u2019s Day 1967 began explosively. Literally: A terrorist bomb exploded in a Montreal mailbox, shutting down the city and spreading days of panic. It was one of five terror attacks to be carried out by the Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec that year; 1966 had seen a string of them, and some of the emerging separatist firebrands would spend the centennial year in prison for the deaths they caused.\nThis was also the year French-Canadians became a distinct political force \u2013 or threat, depending on your perspective. That June, French president Charles de Gaulle made his explosive \u201cVive le Qu\u00e9bec Libre\u201d speech in Montreal, and then announced a less-famous program of French foreign aid to Quebec, intended, in paternalistic fashion, \u201cto help the French of Canada maintain and develop their personality.\u201d And then, in October, the Quebec Liberal politician Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque stunned the country by introducing a resolution at his party\u2019s provincial convention calling for a sovereign Quebec. The next year, he would create the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.\nAgain, this burst of angry Quebecois resistance at the political, diplomatic and criminal level was not a cause but an effect: It was merely the most visible expression of something that had been unfolding in Quebec throughout the postwar years, around a million dinner tables and in thousands of workplaces \u2013 a generation who had no patience with either the Catholic authoritarianism that had governed the province for a century or the British paternalism that had relegated French-Canadians to servant-class status. Quebec\u2019s transformation in 1967 was part of not just the postwar wave of postcolonial awakenings, but also part of a wave of post-Catholic moments that swept across Europe and the Americas.\nThe Quiet Revolution is well known and understood \u2013 after all, it would go on to provoke two secession crises, three attempts to rewrite the constitution (one successful) and a new political centre of gravity in Quebec.\nLess well understood is the quiet revolution that transformed life in English-speaking Canada. As the University of Quebec historian Jos\u00e9 Igartua points out, a revolution in English-Canadian identity \u201ctook place roughly with the same speed and over the same period as Quebec\u2019s Quiet Revolution \u2026 of similar magnitude in the cultural changes it wrought.\u201d\nPut simply: By 1967, most English-Canadians no longer thought of themselves as a single people of British identity. \u201cBefore 1960,\u201d Prof. Igartua says, \u201cBritish referents occupied the same dominant place in definitions of English-Canadian identity as Catholicism did in definitions of Quebecois identity; they were an article of faith for most \u2013 though, as in Quebec, not for all.\u201d\nBut that all changed in the 1950s: \u201cWithin less than 10 years, these dominant referents had been displaced in both collective identities.\u201d\nToday, we tend to remember this quiet revolution in English Canada as \u201cmulticulturalism,\u201d and there\u2019s an assumption that it was imposed from above during the Trudeau years \u2013 or that it was an idea produced and foisted on Canada by the new non-European immigrants who came in the 1970s. In fact, the rejection of mono-ethnic English Canada had taken place a decade or two before \u201cmulticulturalism\u201d became a popular Canadian word. And the change took place in the minds of those British-origin Canadians themselves. What we saw in 1967 was the final death of the old notion of monoculturalism, which by then had lost the support of even those who had been its beneficiaries.\nSpeaking Up: Original Canadians\nThe very fact that even the notion of \u201ctwo Canadas\u201d was controversial in 1967 shows just how deeply first-century Canada had buried its indigenous nations, how little voice or role they had been able to find. Starting a couple decades before Confederation, the First Nations and Inuit peoples of Canada had come to be seen by the country\u2019s colonial rulers as not a partner in nation-building (as they had been before), but a problem to be managed. This, in 1967, was still generally how they were viewed. As Canada celebrated its centennial, \u201cIndians\u201d had only been granted the right to vote seven years before, and the practice of forcing their children to attend residential schools had just passed its late-1950s peak. Until the sixties, their legal status was comparable to that of wildlife.\nSo the second huge report to stun Canada in October, 1967, somewhat overshadowed at the time by the Bilingualism and Biculturalism blockbuster, but equally destined to shape the future, was another federal study four years in the making. It carried the anodyne-sounding title A Survey of the Contemporary Indians of Canada, but its conclusions, organized by anthropologist Harry Hawthorn, were far from academic.\nThe Hawthorn Report concluded that the residential school experience was \u201cunpleasant, frightening and painful\u201d for some indigenous children; for others it is \u201cnot so much adaptive as maladaptive\u201d; in other words, \u201ctheir motivation to do well in school drops during their stay there. \u2026 They come to see themselves as failures.\u201d\nThe attempt to turn hundreds of thousands of native kids into \u201cthe typical middle-class white child\u201d had stripped indigenous communities of their human and cultural resources and damaged them for generations. Such words had not been heard before in establishment Canada.\nBut they were a reflection of something indigenous Canadians already knew. The Hawthorn report would set off a cycle of reactions from government and, especially, from First Nations bands (as they came to call themselves a few years later).\nIt was shortly after this early awakening of 1967 that the Nisga\u2019a Nation of British Columbia would launch their Supreme Court case claiming that the treaties of colonial Canada gave them a constitutional right to their land; the result was a series of crucial court rulings, beginning in 1973, that recognized the treaties and their negotiated rights as fundamental Canadian constitutional documents, a fact that was recognized in the 1982 constitution.\nThirty-seven people from around the world are sworn in as Canadian citizens in Kitchener on December 22, 2016, Glenn Lowson for The Globe and Mail\nSpeaking Up: New Canadians\nOf all the policy changes of 1967, the one that may have done the most to shape modern Canada and put an end to first-century colonialism was that year\u2019s history-making immigration act. It introduced the modern points system, in which immigrants are selected not by appearance or \u201ccharacter\u201d but by points granted for education, linguistic aptitude and skills relevant to the economy; and most importantly, it eliminated all forms of preference or discrimination based on nationality or race for all categories of immigrants. No longer did white or European immigrants have any advantage. Until the 1960s, racial discrimination had been virtually the entire purpose of Canada\u2019s immigration system.\nBut this, too, was a change that was far more a reflection of the new Canada than a creator of it. Since the end of the Second World War, Canada had been very badly in need of people: The fast-growing economy was creating vast labour shortages, and the lack of sufficient consumers and taxpayers was crippling Canada\u2019s economy. But very few people in Britain and Western Europe wanted to come to Canada. In 1961, there had been a net loss of Canadian population to other countries (especially the United States).\nThe \u201cNew Canadians,\u201d from outside Protestant Western Europe, had simply become a reality: Through the 1950s, some government officials and MPs had attempted to prevent Southern European Catholics and Eastern European Jews from entering the country as immigrants or refugees, claiming that their values and faiths were incompatible with Canada\u2019s \u2013 the same argument that had stopped most immigration to Canada for much of the 20th century.\nBut this time, the Canadian people and the Canadian economy had won the day: Italians, Hungarians, Indians and Poles had come, even when it was officially not allowed. Immigration policies had been stretched or exempted and refugee-sponsorship systems had been created to get them in. They had settled in sizable numbers in the big cities, and had quickly ceased to be immigrants making a start in Canada but rather Canadians pressing for immigration; by the late 1960s, a restrictive immigration system looked to most Canadians like both an anachronism and an economic liability. Again, 1967 was simply catching up with Canada.\nA Nation of One\n\u201cThere\u2019s no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation\u201d was an expression that first appeared in a Globe and Mail editorial on December 12, 1967, using slightly different wording, to denounce the horrendous persecution and imprisonment of gays in Canada. Ten days later, it would be uttered by prime minister Pearson\u2019s young justice minister, Pierre Trudeau, when he announced that homosexuality would no longer be a crime.\nThe same phrase might just as well have been uttered two weeks earlier, on Dec. 4, when the Pearson government had introduced a bill to legalize divorce. A few years previously, neither of these acts would have been conceivable: Most people would not have questioned the notion that the Canadian state, as the guardian of a supposedly homogeneous society, had a role of ensuring that its subjects remain married and heterosexual, by force if necessary.\nBut the illusion of homogeneity had long since shattered, and Canadians had become painfully aware that they were not all the same, in sexuality, language, religion, ethnicity, marital status or sex. The colonial mentality of first-century Canada had, in fact, ensured that Canadians were profoundly unequal. In deciding to forge a genuinely Canadian identity, the people of 1967 realized that they had to confront the ugliness behind the illusion.\nThat led to the third in 1967\u2019s trifecta of history-altering royal commissions. On Feb. 3, after months of pressure from activist groups and the threat of two million people marching on Parliament, Mr. Pearson had launched the Royal Commission on the Status of Women, under the leadership of the formidable journalist Florence Bird. Its report three years later led to foundations of legal and constitutional gender equality: pay equity, equality in hiring, national maternity-leave policy, decriminalization of abortion and a cabinet position devoted to the status of women.\nWhat united the sudden changes in divorce, homosexuality and the mainstream view of women, and made them a crucial and inevitable component of second-century Canada, was that they shifted the focus of the state away from anonymous \u201csubjects\u201d and enforced collective identities, and onto the individual citizen. The rights of individuals had often been dismissed, in colonial Canada, as an undesirable Americanism: They weren\u2019t something we did.\nBut they were part of an unstoppable cascade of discoveries: Once you begin to question whether Canada is really one homogeneous nation, if it is in fact two nations, or an aboriginal nation and two founding nations, or many nations sharing common values, then your focus has to shift to the individual citizen. The postcolonial mentality meant that women, gays, racial and religious minorities had to be confronted as specific people with specific experiences and expectations.\nThere is a solid line leading from the events of 1967 to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 1982: It was impossible to have a Canada of multiple peoples, as we discovered was necessary in the late 1960s, without having a Canada of individual people and their rights. Collective identities continued to exist \u2013 they are central to Canada \u2013 but after 1967, they were recognized as matters of choice and affinity, not of obligation and legal mandate.\nThe Second-Century Spiral\nIndividual rights, Quebecois consciousness, indigenous shared-sovereignty status and cultural plurality weren\u2019t the only inevitable outcomes of the 1967 moment. What Canada witnessed over the next two decades was a self-reinforcing spiral of events that often sprung directly from the centennial-era awakening of a postcolonial consciousness.\nFor example, one of the consequences of Canada\u2019s colonial period had been a strain of anti-Americanism, manifesting itself both culturally and economically. The U.S. border had been walled up with tariff barriers and British Empire favouritism since Confederation (despite a brave but failed effort by prime minister Wilfrid Laurier to knock it down).\nMr. Pearson\u2019s predecessor, Mr. Diefenbaker, had struggled to retain a British Canada both in culture and symbols, and also in economy: Ten years earlier, he\u2019d attempted to build postwar trade ties with the old motherland with a proposed Canada-Britain free-trade deal and to require Canadians to spend 15 per cent of their money on UK exports.\nThis ran aground when Mr. Diefenbaker discovered that Britain was far more interested in having free trade with its European neighbours than it was in its former colonies \u2013 and by the simple fact that neither Canada\u2019s economy nor large parts of its culture had much to do with Britain any more. So free trade with the United States, which emerged from the Liberals in the late 1970s and became a reality under the Progressive Conservatives after a fraught election in 1988, was a fairly certain outcome of the seismic shifts that manifested themselves in 1967.\nAs was a shift away from an economy devoted to agriculture and resource extraction. That had been Canada\u2019s main purpose during its first century: Until the postwar decades, it was widely taken for granted that Canada\u2019s central role was to provide resources and food (along with soldiers) to Britain. In fact, as the historian R.W. Sandwell found in his study Canada\u2019s Rural Majority, as a consequence of this role, Canada remained a largely rural country for decades longer than the United States and other Western countries (Canada\u2019s rural population did not begin to fall until 1976).\nYou can see how the spiral unfolded: To get away from the wood-hauling and water-hewing game, Canada needed to stop seeing the United Kingdom as its main economic client.\nThat, in turn, meant it needed to open its borders with the United States and start seeing itself as North American. And for that to work, it needed to start attracting the sort of immigrants who were entrepreneurial and wanted to stay, and reach beyond its colonial borders. Once this had happened, Canada could no longer see its citizens as an undifferentiated mass of British subjects, but as members of disparate communities and as individuals. And doing that meant that indigenous communities could no longer be treated like problems to be managed, but as equal partners in a shared territory. And all these things required a set of new laws and institutions that made the pieces of the new Canada fit together.\nOnce the bucket of Canadian identities had been kicked over by 1967\u2019s spasm of centennial joy, a cascade of new realities, new ideas, new institutions and new ways of living came flooding out. Fifty years later, we are still awash in their novelty. We are the children of 1967, the entirely new people who came out of that container."}

So instead, that data is chopped up into smaller pieces and sent sequentially. But to ensure that the video quality is sufficient, sites like YouTube leverage ABR (Adaptive BitRate) algorithms to determine at what resolution the video will play. ABRs generally come in two styles: those that measure how fast a network can transmit data and those that work to maintain a sufficient buffer at the head of the video.\nIf the rate-based algorithm fails, the video will suffer pixelation as the system drops the bitrate to ensure that the video keeps playing. But if you try to skip too far ahead, it causes havoc with the buffer-based system which then has to freeze playback while it loads both the new chunk of video and the buffer ahead of it. Both of these ABRs are essentially addressing two sides of the same overarching issue, but neither is fully capable of solving it. And that's where AI comes in.\nThere's actually already been a bit of research into this issue. A research team from Carnegie Mellon recently developed a \"model predictive control\" (MPC) scheme that attempts to predict how network conditions will change over time and make optimizations decisions based on that model. The problem with that system, however, is that it will only ever be as good as the model itself and it is ill-suited for networks that see sudden or drastic changes in traffic flows.\nCSAIL's AI, dubbed Pensive, does not rely on a model. Instead it's used machine learning to figure out when (and under what conditions) to switch between rate and buffer-based ABRs. Like other neural networks, Pensive uses rewards and penalties to weight the results of each trial. Over time, the system is able to tune its behavior to consistently receive the highest reward. Interestingly, since the rewards can be adjusted, the entire system can be tuned to behave however we want.\n\"Our system is flexible for whatever you want to optimize it for,\" MIT professor Mohammad Alizadeh said in a statement. \"You could even imagine a user personalizing their own streaming experience based on whether they want to prioritize rebuffering versus resolution.\" The team trained this neural network on just a month's worth of downloaded video content and yet was able to get the same resolution quality as the MPC system but with 10 to 30 percent less buffering.\nWe should eventually see this technology be adopted by the likes of YouTube and Netflix but first, the MIT team hopes to apply the AI to VR. \"The bitrates you need for 4K-quality VR can easily top hundreds of megabits per second, which today's networks simply can't support,\" Alizadeh said. \"We're excited to see what systems like Pensieve can do for things like VR. This is really just the first step in seeing what we can do.\""}

But they did not sound optimistic.\n\"Realistically, I do not think we can hope\" to avoid either U.S. tariffs or quotas on steel and aluminum, said Cecilia Malmstrom, the European Union's trade commissioner.\nThe United States in March announced tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. But it granted an exemption to the EU and other U.S. allies; that reprieve expires Friday.\nEven if the U.S. were to agree to waive the tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, Malmstrom said, \"I expect them nonetheless to want to impose some sort of cap on EU exports.\"\nEuropean officials said they expect the United States to announce its final decision Thursday. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross attended meetings at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris on Wednesday, and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer joins discussions in Paris on Thursday.\nAdvertisement\nThe U.S. plan has raised the threat of retaliation from Europe and fears of a global trade war \u2014 a prospect that is already weighing on investor confidence and could hinder the global economic upturn.\n\"Unilateral responses and threats over trade war will solve nothing of the serious imbalances in the world trade. Nothing,\" French President Emmanuel Macron said in an impassioned speech at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris.\nIn a clear reference to U.S. President Donald Trump, Macron added: \"These solutions might bring symbolic satisfaction in the short term ... One can think about making voters happy by saying: I have a victory, I'll change the rules, you'll see.\"\nBut he said that those \"who waged bilateral trade wars ... saw an increase in prices and an increase in unemployment.\"\nTariffs on steel imports to the U.S. can help local producers of the metal by making foreign products more expensive. But they can also increase costs more broadly for U.S. manufacturers who cannot source all their steel locally and need to import the raw material. That hurts the companies and can lead to more expensive consumer prices, economists say.\nEurope is expecting a decision from Trump during the day Thursday, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said. He pledged that the European response would be \"united and firm.\"\nIf the U.S. goes ahead with its tariffs, the EU has threatened to impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. orange juice, peanut butter and other goods in return.\nBesides the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs, the Trump administration is also investigating possible limits on foreign cars in the name of U.S. national security.\nAfter meeting with Ross, German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier told reporters that he doesn't expect a decision soon on foreign cars.\nRoss criticized the EU for its tough negotiating position.\n\"There can be negotiations with or without tariffs in place. There are plenty of tariffs the EU has on us. It's not that we can't talk just because there's tariffs,\" he said. He noted that \"China has not used that as an excuse not to negotiate.\"\nBut Germany's Altmaier insisted that the Europeans were being \"constructive\" and were ready to negotiate special trade arrangements, notably for liquefied natural gas and industrial goods, including cars.\nMacron also proposed to start negotiations between the U.S., the EU, China and Japan to reshape the World Trade Organization to better regulate trade. Discussions could then be expanded to include other countries to agree on changes by the end of the year.\nRoss expressed concern that the Geneva-based World Trade Organization and other organizations are too rigid and slow to adapt to changes in global business.\n\"We would operate within (multilateral) frameworks if we were convinced that people would move quickly,\" he said.\nRoss and Lighthizer seem like the odd men out at this week's gathering at the OECD, an international economic agency that includes the U.S. as a prominent member.\nThe agency issued a report Wednesday saying \"the threat of trade restrictions has begun to adversely affect confidence\" and tariffs \"would negatively influence investment and jobs.\"\nThe OECD also said persistent high oil prices could push up inflation and push down household incomes. After a first-quarter slowdown, the agency slightly revised down its forecast for world growth this year to 3.8 percent, with 3.9 percent expected next year.\n___\nMasha Macpherson and Oleg Cetinic in Paris and Paul Wiseman in Washington contributed to this report."}

I was able to try some of the new foods at a public event, and well, not all of them are praise-worthy. \u201cAssorted bags of Frito-Lay snacks,\u201d for example, are not exciting, though they are counted in the long list of new foods. So I went through the list for you, and picked out the 13 most noteworthy options.\nWong's Wok: Kowloon Beef\nThis is one item I was able to sample, and it was surprisingly delicious, even if a big hunk of beef might not scream \u201cfestival.\u201d The beef is marinated in a sauce that's similar to teriyaki, with garlic and ginger, then skewered and grilled. Order it by itself or as part of a plate with fried rice or other goodies.\nTrinity Three Irish Pubs: Deep South Twister Dog\nTake a Usinger's smoked sausage, put it on a stick, wrap it in spiral-sliced sweet potato and fry it. Then load it up with pimento cheese sauce, beer braised onions, chipotle ketchup and pickled peppers. You had me at \u201cpimento cheese.\u201d\nMartino's: Pretzilla Pretzel with Pine River Beer Cheese\nOK, so this one's just (really good) soft pretzels, but it's the cheese spread that's the standout. Pine River recently swept a bunch of Wisconsin cheese awards, and I can vouch that their spread is delicious. If you've never tried any of them, now's your chance.\nLouise's Trattoria: Short Rib Arancini\nHomemade parmesan risotto is mixed with wine-braised short ribs, rolled into balls and deep fried. It's topped with truffle cream sauce, because why not?\nSaz's Dockside: Stuffed Bacon-Wrapped Jalapenos\nFresh jalapenos are stuffed with BBQ pork and cheddar, then wrapped in bacon, deep-fried and served with spicy white BBQ sauce. Two kinds of pork and hot peppers? Count me in.\nSaz's Dockside: Cheddar Potato Tots with BBQ Pork\nHefty potato and cheddar balls are breaded and deep fried, then topped with BBQ sauce, pulled pork and chives. It's one substantial boat of food.\nSaz's Dockside: Deep Fried Bread Pudding Bites Ice Cream Sundae\nSaz's is clearly on a roll this year. Three hunks of homemade vanilla bread pudding are deep fried and topped with Cedar Crest ice cream and sea salt caramel. Fried desserts and ice cream are irresistible together.\nWater Street Brewery: Yard Bird Nachos\nThese nachos use crispy chicken cracklins instead of tortilla chips, perhaps in the name of low-carb eating, but sounds like a good switch to me. They're topped with cheesy mashed potatoes, which is kind of weird for nachos, but also BBQ pulled chicken, corn salsa and pickled peppers. Perhaps this is more like a KFC bowl than nachos?\nAngelo's: Stuffed Pasta Pizza\nFor carb lovers only. A deep dish garlic and Romano pizza crust is filled with penne pasta, homemade meatballs and Italian sausage, red sauce and mozzarella cheese.\nMader's: Beer Battered Bratwurst on a Stick\nThere's no incarnation of brats that Milwaukeeans don't love. A Usinger's brat is dipped in a German lager beer batter, deep-fried and served with kraut and pickles. It's like a corndog, only German.\nCedar Crest: Waffle Nachos Hot Fudge Sundae\nVanilla ice cream with hot fudge, whipped cream, and little rounds of waffle cone that you dip in the sundae. It's basically a waffle cone with hot fudge, but who doesn't like waffle cones? This is better for sharing.\nVagabond: Flamin' Hot Cheetos Tacos\nMKE cannot be behind on the Flamin' Hot Cheetos trend. Two tacos are filled with chili, smoked brisket, serrano crema, pickled red pepper, cheese curds and Flamin' Hot Cheetos. Sounds like a mouthful.\nVagabond: Deep-Fried Mojito\nNot to be outdone by last year's deep fried old fashioned, they turn a different drink into dessert form. Lime rum flavored cake is stuffed with a mint cream cheese filling, battered and fried. It's topped with lime rum flavored syrup and mint whipped cream."}

The rest of the AL East is obviously going to talk about seeing the Yankees flex with the addition of Giancarlo Stanton and brace for a counter-strike by the Red Sox that could be an Eric Hosmer or J.D. Martinez.\nBut brave words will not tell as much as what the Rays do with Evan Longoria, the Blue Jays with Josh Donaldson and the Orioles with Manny Machado.\nIn the past, those three teams have avoided full-on tanking and tried to win in the face of whatever spending was being done by the Northeast powerhouses. And the success rate has been pretty good in recent years. Over the past five seasons, each of the five AL East teams has made the playoffs at least once.\nBut we may be having a bit of a back to the future now. In the eight seasons from 1998 to 2005, the Yankees finished first and the Red Sox second every year. In 2017, the Red Sox won the AL East, the Yankees earned a wild card and then the third-place Rays were 11 games beyond the Yankees. And from those cores, the Yanks already have added Stanton.\n\u201cWe make our decisions independent of what other teams are doing,\u201d Rays owner Stu Sternberg said. \u201cAt least that is our goal. Competing in the East is either impossible or next to impossible, which is why I value the AL East championships we have won as our brightest accomplishments.\u201d\nLongoria has represented the one immovable piece in the Rays\u2019 ever-changing cast. They have signed him long-term on two different occasions, and he is under control through 2023. But, more than ever, Tampa is considering a pivot and will listen on the greatest player in its history, as well as starters Chris Archer and Jake Odorizzi and closer Alex Colome.\nThe Orioles have been more defiant about not breaking up. But Machado, Zach Britton and Adam Jones are all free agents after 2018, Baltimore\u2019s rotation is currently short-handed and its farm system is not ready to provide big-time support.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing new as far as the challenge to the rest of the division,\u201d manager Buck Showalter said. \u201cBut God bless the Yankees, if I were them, I\u2019d do the same thing.\u201d\nGM Dan Duquette added: \u201cWe are still going to try to compete the best we can.\u201d\nLike Machado, Donaldson is in his walk year. The Blue Jays are looking for corner-outfield bats to continue to try to win with their current group while not doing the kind of long-term deals or trade significant prospects that would unsettle the near future. Toronto officials know the team has done a good job regaining a fan base\u2019s support and do not want to disenchant them with a sell-off.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard not to be impacted by it, but we need to control what we can control and the general plan remains the same,\u201d Blue Jays team president Mark Shapiro said.\nThe current belief is that Longoria is much more likely to be dealt this offseason than Machado or Donaldson, but since the latter two are in their walk year, if the AL East plays out as expected \u2014 with the Red Sox and Yankees separating themselves at the top \u2014 then already you could see Machado and Donaldson becoming the biggest names discussed at the July trade deadline.\nThe Mets are looking at myriad second base options and one of them is Ryan Goins, who was recently non-tendered by the Blue Jays.\nGoins has been known for his versatility and strong defense, but also lacking offense. The Mets want to upgrade their defense and, in theory, could team the lefty swinger with a righty partner such as Wilmer Flores or T.J. Rivera at second.\nThe Phillies did due diligence on Stanton, making calls to get background information on him. But apparently nothing ever got overly serious between Philadelphia and Miami.\nThe Royals, contemplating a further teardown to rebuild, are fielding interest in closer Kelvin Herrera, who drew interest from the Astros, among others, at the trade deadline last July.\nHerrera, who can be a free agent after the 2018 campaign, is coming off his worst season. He had a 4.25 ERA and allowed nine homers in 59 1\/3 innings.\nThe Reds continue to listen on outfielders Billy Hamilton and Adam Duvall. The Giants, in particular, have had interest in the fleet Hamilton, who has topped 55 steals in each of the past four seasons and is rated a top defender at a time when San Francisco is looking to upgrade its fielding.\nThe Giants also are looking for righty power, and Duvall is one of only 12 players to top 30 homers in each of the last two seasons.

The Archdiocese opposed the bill, but found relatively easy passage at the Board of Aldermen, with a 17 to 10 vote.For NARAL Pro-Choice Missouri, the legislative victory was part of a conscious decision to go on the offense on the municipal level rather than just play defense at the state legislature. Executive Director Alison Dreith now plans to work with allies on the board to reintroduce in April a bill to mandate a buffer zone at the state's only abortion clinic , and she hopes to have even more friendly members on the Board of Aldermen to help her do it.\"We're endorsing in races for the first time ever,\" she says of this March's Democratic primary, which will likely select some news members of the Board of Aldermen as well as a new mayor. (NARAL has endorsed City Treasurer Tishaura Jones for the mayor's job.) \"People are finding they have to take us seriously.\"St. Louis has long been a blue island in the middle of a red state, but NARAL's strategy refuses to take it for granted. The organization recently has focused on door-to-door canvassing within St. Louis, hoping to increase its local footprint. It now boasts 8,000 members in the city alone.Still, before the celebration Monday came some tense moments on Friday at the Board of Aldermen, as Dreith acknowledges. Alderwoman Christine Ingrassia, who co-sponsored the bill, had told her going into the meeting that they had the votes for passage \u2014 but then Dreith was summoned to the dais by President Lewis Reed. \"You guys don't have the votes anymore,\" he told her. \"You should withdraw the bill and come back later.\"Dreith was stunned, but conferred with Ingrassia before making a decision. Ingrassia was sure they had the votes. Dreith decided they had to go for it \u2014 who knew where things would stand when the board reconvened months later?\"I said, 'If anyone has flipped, I'll hold those people accountable,'\" Dreith recalls.Reached by phone Monday, Reed says he wasn't trying to pull a fast one; he genuinely believed the bill didn't have enough votes for passage. And contrary to what Dreith believes, he says he didn't mean they'd have to wait until April; he assumed at the time that the board would be reconvening this week. That, he thought, would give Dreith time to firm up her votes. \"I told her she should consider it,\" he acknowledges. \"You've got to be smart about when you have the votes. If they would have lost one of their votes and the thing failed, it would be dead.\"Still, that white-knuckle decision proved the correct one. (\"I never had a doubt in my mind,\" Ingrassia says.)Its victory now on the books, NARAL plans to continue fighting, at City Hall and across the state. And while Donald Trump's ascension to the presidency has been crushing for progressives, Dreith will admit to seeing one small silver lining.\"The people who were apathetic are no longer apathetic,\" she says."}

We have one stoplight in the whole county. And the people are the greatest people you'll ever meet in your life.\"\nA graduate of Concord University, DeLong said McDowell County was an excellent place to grow up.\nBut as he prepares to head to pharmacy school in the fall, he's not sure whether the home that shaped him -- and gave him his love for hunting and fishing -- will be a part of his future.\nThe state, and this region in particular, has been hit particularly hard -- from diminished demand for coal, long the economic bedrock of the region, to the opioid crisis gripping many rural towns.\nMost problematic for McDowell County's future: People are leaving and not coming back.\nThe New River Gorge Bridge in Fayetteville, West Virginia, is the third-longest single span arch bridge in the world, and a popular tourist attraction in the southern part of the state.\nThe loss of coal mining jobs has accelerated in recent years. In the fourth quarter of 2011, coal employed 26,000 West Virginians. By the second quarter of 2016, that number had plummeted to just 12,000.\nIn 1950, McDowell County had nearly 100,000 residents, many of whom worked in the area's coal mines. Today, McDowell is one of the poorest counties in the country, with median household income under $25,000 and just over 20,000 people in the county.\nWest Virginia high school grads go to college at a lower rate than their American peers, with 55% enrollment, compared to 64% nationally.\nWith the future of southern West Virginia uncertain, we asked recent graduates from the region: Do they plan to stay in West Virginia to build a life and career, or do they feel the need to get out to succeed?\nAll the students we spoke with will enroll in college or have already graduated. Here's what six of them said about their futures -- and that of their home.\nFrom the coalfields to Cambridge\nGrace Bannister, 17\nThis fall, Logan County's Grace Bannister is heading to a place worlds away from where she grew up: Harvard University.\n\"I think there's a very large gap in the quality of life between where I'm from and where I'm going,\" she said.\nGrace Bannister shows off her graduation cap in her backyard in Chapmanville, West Virginia. Bannister graduated this year as valedictorian of her class and plans to attend Harvard University in the fall.\nBannister has lost family members to drug overdoses and seen her father's mining supply company weather tough times to stay in business. She's concerned about the future of her home.\n\"I almost feel like it'll become like a ghost town because most of the population at this point is older,\" she said.\nAt Harvard, Bannister plans to major in government or anthropology. Unlike some other recent graduates we spoke to, Bannister wants to be a part of the change she says her home needs.\nGrace Bannister joins friends before the start of \"Hairspray\" at Chief Logan State Park in Logan, West Virginia. \"A lot of what you hear about this place is the negative, but we have so many positives,\" she said. \"We have such a rich culture and feeling of community in this area, because when you grow up in a place of hardship, it really bonds a group of people together.\"\n\"I hope to someday come back and either try to make a difference working in the legal sector to help people get their lives on track, or I'd really like to someday run for public office -- maybe Senate or governor to try to help on a national level.\"\n'They just want to jump on the bandwagon to make fun'\nCody DeLong, 22\nHis father, brother, uncles and several cousins have worked in southern West Virginia's coal mines, but Cody DeLong plans to take a different path.\nThis fall, DeLong will begin his first year at Marshall University's School of Pharmacy. When he finishes school, he doesn't think he'll return home but he plans to settle somewhere in rural Appalachia.\nA view of the Superior Processing Inc. coal mine in McDowell County, West Virginia.\nGrowing up in McDowell County and witnessing the toll that drug abuse took on many families led him to discover his life's calling.\n\"There are a lot of doctors and pharmacists that -- you can't really blame it all on them -- but they really contribute to the big epidemic of opioid abuse that we have.\"\nHe doesn't deny the problems facing McDowell County -- \"The facts are the facts\" -- but is critical of how the mainstream media has covered his home.\n\"They don't really find any of the success stories,\" he said. \"They just want to jump on the bandwagon to make fun.\"\n'We basically had to start over from nothing'\nJoseph Hayes, 17\nIn 2001, as deadly floods swept through McDowell County, Joseph Hayes' mother fetched him from day care in a panic before meeting his father and fleeing to higher ground.\nBy the time the waters subsided, the family's home, dogs and nearly everything they owned was gone.\nJoseph Hayes, 17, sits in his bedroom in Premier, West Virginia. Hayes has felt supported growing up black in a predominantly white community in McDowell County. \"People here really don't see color.\"\n\"We basically had to start over from nothing,\" Hayes said.\nWith FEMA's assistance, Hayes and his family relocated to a trailer park near Welch, West Virginia, where he spent much of his childhood.\nDespite the hardship, Hayes excelled in the classroom and on the football field. This fall, he will play football at Glenville State College. If his NFL dreams don't pan out, he'd like to pursue a career in physical therapy. And though he says it's unlikely, he remains open to the idea of returning to McDowell County.\nThe Mount View High School Golden Knights football stadium in Welch, West Virginia.\n\"I hope things pick back up and do well, but the future right now isn't looking the best,\" he said. \"I want to come back, but I don't want to come back with nothing. I want to come back with something to help the people here.\"\nThe 'tree hugger' who is pro-mining\nDaniel Buchanan, 18\nIn Gilbert, West Virginia, where the mascot of nearby Mingo Central High School is the \"Miners,\" coal mining is a deeply entrenched way of life -- one that Daniel Buchanan knows well. His father spent much of his life working in the mines.\nSo when Buchanan says he wants to major in biology or environmental science, the potential conflicts between the livelihood of his hometown and his own future are obvious. But Buchanan doesn't see it that way. He says you can care about the natural world and also hope that coal returns to its former glory.\nWater filtration at the Superior Processing Inc. coal mine in McDowell County, West Virginia.\n\"A lot of people ask me the question, 'What are you going to do when you get older?' I tell them that I want to do something with the environment, and the first thing they think is, 'Oh, so that means you're a tree hugger.' But in reality, I am all for the coal mines,\" Buchanan said.\nBuchanan is open to the idea of returning to Mingo County after college, but feels that staking the hopes of the region on a rebounding coal industry is risky.\n\"I think it would be wonderful if coal came back to where it was, say, 10 or 15 years ago. But we still need to diversify,\" he said. \"We need to have other options other than coal, because coal is not going to be around forever -- it's simple science.\"\nLooking for 'somewhere a little more progressive'\nEmma Pino, 18\nEmma Pino lost her father to cancer when she was only 13, but her time growing up with him in Oak Hill, West Virginia, inspired her to pursue a career helping others.\nPino says her father struggled with mental disorders for years, but found success with treatment. And though he didn't finish college, he pushed his daughter to shine academically.\nEmma Pino plays guitar next to her grandmother, Helen Romage, on her front porch in Mount Hope, West Virginia. Pino plans to attend West Virginia University in the fall, but says she'll likely leave the state after college. \"I will probably always have family ties here so it will be hard to let all that go, but I think I need to.\"\nAfter graduating at the top of her class this spring, Pino will attend West Virginia University in Morgantown, where she plans to major in psychology and work with people like her father.\n\"'[Psychological treatment] helped him turn his life around, so I would really love to do that for somebody else,\" she said.\nPino isn't sure where she'll settle to start her career but says it probably won't be in West Virginia.\n\"For me personally, I think I need to go somewhere a little more progressive,\" she said. \"It's just sort of sad to watch people so hopeful for even the current president to fix all the problems that we have here, and I don't see it happening.\"\n'... A close-knit family, no matter the race'\nNadia Johnson, 18\nGrowing up in a town with fewer than 200 residents, Nadia Johnson says she loved the community where she was raised.\nJohnson is African-American, and though McDowell County is nearly 90% white, she says she never experienced racism or discrimination.\n\"When I first started going to school, my best friend was of a different race, and we are still best friends to this day,\" she said. \"We are a close-knit family, no matter the race.\"\nLately, residents of all races have experienced adversity. Over the course of her 18 years, Johnson has seen businesses and jobs flee the area. Last year, a Walmart supercenter -- one of the few grocery suppliers nearby -- closed its doors.\nA railroad that runs through the town of Logan, West Virginia.\n\"There are other grocery stores we can shop at, and thankfully, I live close enough to the surrounding counties so I can easily go ... but for other people, they have to travel 45 minutes to an hour just to get to Walmart,\" Johnson said.\nOthers in her family have gone to college, but Johnson -- who finished at the top of her class and plans to study chemistry at Concord University -- is aiming to become the first to complete a higher degree. If she succeeds, she doesn't think she'll be back in McDowell County.\n\"I plan to come back to visit ... but coming back and just living here all my life? I don't think I'll do that.\""}

On the other hand, the majority of ETFs are index based or passively managed and only try to mirror holdings of a benchmark index.\nMutual funds are only able to trade once a day where trade orders receive the same daily price calculated at the end of the trading day. In contrast, ETFs trade like stocks through out the day when the market is open, so potential investors have greater flexibility and control over the timing and price of their ETF investments.\nDepending on what brokerage platform you patronize, the mutual fund options can vary widely. Since ETFs trade on a exchange like stocks, investors on any brokerage account can buy or sell any ETFs.\nUnlike mutual funds, ETFs do not have restrictions on frequent trading, which is beneficial when conducting specific portfolio reconstruction, especially if one were to execute something like a tax loss harvesting scheme to swap around holdings over a short period.\nMutual funds typically come with a minimum investment dollar amount. ETFs, though, don\u2019t come with minimums. ETF investors would only need to pay as much as it costs to invest in one single share of an ETF. However, ETF investors would still need to pay brokerage fees on each ETF trade, but there are some platforms that are offering zero cost or commission-free trading on specific ETFs.\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\u201cBecause ETFs and mutual funds are more similar than different, focusing on your investment objective, flexibility needs and the total cost differences of either vehicle, can help you make an educated decision,\u201d according to Vanguard.\nFor more information on ETFs, visit our ETF 101 category.\nRead more at ETFtrends.com >"}

The partial solar eclipse that will be visible in New Jersey is much more subtle, but will be noticeable if you know what to look for.\u201d\nWatch a YouTube video on the solar eclipse\nTips for Safe Eclipse Viewing\nBecause it is unsafe to look directly at the sun, Pryor said anyone wishing to see the phenomenon must protect their eyes with specially made and certified filters, or by observing the eclipse indirectly.\nDirect viewing can be done safely with No. 14 arc welder glass or with eclipse viewing glasses that meet the following criteria outlined by NASA:\nHave certification information with a designated ISO 12312-2 international standard\nHave the manufacturer\u2019s name and address printed on the product\nNot be used if more than three years old, or with scratched or wrinkled lenses\nHomemade filters or sunglasses \u2013 even very dark ones \u2013 are NEVER safe for looking directly at the sun. There are reports of potentially unsafe eclipse glasses appearing for sale, so be sure to buy eclipse viewers from reputable vendors.\nPryor offered a few suggestions for safe, indirect viewing.\nIf the sky is clear at around 2:45 p.m. on the day of the eclipse, stand in a leafy tree\u2019s shadow and look at the ground. The smallest spots of sunlight will make little crescent shapes, showing the sun\u2019s apparent shape as the moon crosses in front.\nAnother method is to make a small hole in a piece of cardboard with the tip of a pencil or pen and project the light onto a white piece of paper, he said. For a better view, put the hole over a mirror and reflect the light onto a more distant white piece of paper or white surface.\nTotal eclipses in the Continental U.S. are unusual, with the last one unfolding in 1979, Pryor said. Hawaii experienced one in 1991, and New Jersey will have to wait until May 1, 2079, to get one. Even then, the total eclipse will be visible only in the northern two-thirds of the state and will occur only a few minutes after sunrise, so it won\u2019t be easily visible.\n\u201cAn eclipse is a remarkable phenomenon,\u201d Pryor said. \u201cIt was always regarded as signifying something important. Some people thought something was eating the sun and tried to make noise to scare it away. But the ancient Greeks understood what was happening and could start to predict some of these phenomena.\u201d"}

{"id":"f56e11ea-2239-4d21-9dca-0eea3270bbdb","text":"This weekend, The New York Times\u2019s tech reporter, Nellie Bowles, referred to the Palestinian Authority\u2019s $400 million payment to terrorists and their families as a \u201cfar-right conspiracy.\u201d Several reporters, myself included, called Bowles out for this flagrant bit of fake news, and her newspaper eventually removed the statement and issued a necessary correction. Good for them. But Bowles herself has yet to apologize or acknowledge her egregious error in judgment, which means it\u2019s time to look into her bizarre statement and its origins in greater depth.\nWhere did the idea of the Palestinian pay-for-slay program being fake news come from? As several journalists pointed out on social media this weekend, Bowles\u2019s source was likely Glenn Kessler, who writes The Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker column. In a March column entitled \u201cDoes the Palestinian Authority pay $350 million a year to \u2018terrorists and their families\u2019?\u201d Kessler answered the question by giving it two Pinocchios, indicating that it is largely false. Why? Because there was no way, Kessler wrote, to know which of the aid recipients were truly terrorists.\n\u201cThere is no standard definition for terrorism in the U.S. government, a problem State Department officials encountered when they sought to penalize the PA,\u201d wrote the Washington Post\u2019s anointed Fact Checker. \u201cAs the cliche goes, one man\u2019s terrorist is another person\u2019s freedom fighter.\u201d As such, Kessler averred, it\u2019s hard to say exactly how much money went to bona fide terrorists and how much was awarded to support needy Palestinian families in a legitimate policy of social welfare.\nAmbiguity is hard! Unless, that is, you take a moment to, you know, do cursory research on the subject you are writing about. Yosef Kuperwasser, the former head of the IDF intelligence\u2019s research branch, has already explained, in Tablet, that one main feature of the Palestinian pay-for-slay program is that \u201cpayments increase with increased punishment, which accompanies the severity of the terror attack.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s not the size of the terrorist\u2019s family that matters, but the size of the family he slaughters: The more dead Jews, the longer the prison sentence, the bigger the dollar amount. It\u2019s a basic incentive structure that every Toyota salesperson would immediately comprehend.\nMost Americans, thankfully, comprehend it, too, which is why it inspired the rare bipartisan bit of legislation, the Taylor Force Act. And it moved that notorious far-right conspiracy theorist Sen. Chuck Schumer to support it, saying that \u201cPresident [Mahmoud] Abbas must be held accountable for the Palestinian Authority\u2019s record of incitement and must stop subsidizing terror. It\u2019s abhorrent that the Palestinian Authority provides payments to terrorists and families of those who have committed terrorist violence against Israelis and Americans and others.\u201d\nBut why believe the former head of the IDF\u2019s intelligence research branch and the ranking Democratic member of the US Congress? Maybe Kuperwasser just makes stuff up because he\u2019s a Zionist agent who therefore\u2014just like those so-called \u201creporters\u201d for far-right outlets who propagate \u201cfake news\u201d\u2014doesn\u2019t care about his credibility while spouting a bunch of self-pleasing, pernicious blather? And maybe Chuck Schumer and the rest of Congress are in Israel\u2019s pocket, right? Why be gullible?\nHere, then, is Mahmoud Abbas: \u201cWhoever has [weapons]\u2013go ahead and do it,\u201d Abbas told the PLO Central Council in a January 14, 2018 address. \u201cI say this out in the open. If you have weapons, go ahead. I\u2019m with you, and I will help you. Anyone who has weapons can go ahead\u2026The Americans are always telling us that we must stop paying salaries to the families of the martyrs and the prisoners. We categorically reject this demand. Under no circumstances will we allow the families of the martyrs, the wounded, and the prisoners to be harmed.\u201d\nBut Kessler doesn\u2019t seem to be swayed by direct admissions, either. Why? Apparently because he has own, more reliable Palestinian source, Defense for Children International Palestine, which Kessler characterized simply as \u201ca nongovernmental institution.\u201d As NGO Monitor helpfully reported, however, the organization has strong ties to the PFLP, which has long been designated by the State Department as a terrorist group.\nFor a self-advertised professional fact-checker and a onetime actual reporter who covered the Middle East, Kessler seems to have piss-poor judgement when it comes to sources, and\/or a weird reluctance to admit when he\u2019s dead wrong. In his role as fact-checker, the assertion of a terrorist front group as \u201cproof\u201d that an exhaustively documented phenomenon is \u201cfake news\u201d is worse than bad judgement: It\u2019s toxic. Especially when his baseless claim is then parroted by a New York Times tech reporter, who apparently couldn\u2019t be bothered to do, you know, real reporting.\nThe shoddiness of it all\u2014 from two newspapers that just jointly awarded themselves the Pulitzer Prize for their reporting on Russian fake news and Trump and the 2016 election (or something; the prize citation contained so many weasel words that it was impossible to say exactly what the prize was for, or who won it)\u2014is so blatant that it crosses into willful denialism. If this is \u201creal news,\u201d how could \u201cfake news\u201d possibly be more fake?\nWhat one is left with is the strong impression that \u201creal news\u201d means any story that fits the ideological biases and narrative preconceptions of the reporter and their audience while \u201cfake news\u201d is whatever you disagree with or makes you uncomfortable. Which, if anyone out there at the Times and the Post still cares about such matters, makes a mockery of the idea that there is such a thing as \u201cnews,\u201d and suggests that consumers of whatever digital product these \u201cnewspapers\u201d are now selling would be better off getting their \u201cnews\u201d direct from Kim Kardashian\u2019s Twitter feed or other popular social media, which makes no pretense of being anything other than a massive multiplayer role-playing game with a popularity feature torqued by the whims of the algorithm geeks in Silicon Valley and their Putin-loving AI overlords.\nI\u2019ll say it again: It\u2019s been two days now, with actual reporters in the real news business pointing out Nellie Bowles\u2019s error, and still no apology. If fake news is such a serious problem, shouldn\u2019t Bowles\u2014a reporter at one of the few ostensibly \u201creal newspapers\u201d left\u2014be eager to address her glaring error in an article about, of all things, fake news? It\u2019s like watching someone complain about litter while throwing soda cans and empty Doritos bags into the town reservoir. Maybe the real problem of fake news is reporters like Kessler and Bowles, and the editors who fail to ensure the quality of their work.\nDoes this all sound way too personal? It is personal. By saying that this story is fake, these reporters are insulting the memory of Taylor Force, his family, and the US Congress, which passed the Taylor Force Act last month. They are insulting the memories of the many Israelis slain by murderers driven to bloodshed in part by generous financial incentives. And they are also blithely accusing us at Tablet and other reporters who have covered this tragic and grotesque story for years of publishing \u201cfake news,\u201d when they are flat wrong \u2014 and lazy, to boot. A routine correction isn\u2019t enough. We deserve an apology, or else Kessler and Bowles should forfeit their right to complain about \u201cfake news\u201d or purport to \u201cfact-check\u201d anyone ever again.\nLiel Leibovitz is a senior writer for Tablet Magazine."}

Castleford\u2019s most recent win on any of St Helens\u2019 various home grounds was 12-8 in a Regal Trophy tie in 1992 and they haven\u2019t tasted league success there since a 29-16 victory in 1990.\nPaul McShane's run is held by Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook and Danny Richardson.\nCastleford went into the sides\u2019 opening Betfred Super League fixture with high hopes of ending that 30-game winless run, but not only did the hoodoo continue, Tigers found themselves on the wrong end of the sort of drubbing they were accustomed to handing out last year.\nTwo tries in the opening seven minutes set the scene and Castleford were 22-0 adrift by half-time.\nThings did not improve for last year\u2019s league leaders and Grand Final runners-up in the second half as Saints ended with a total of eight tries, seven of them converted by Danny Richardson.\nIt is a century and a half since Queen Victoria granted the charter that incorporated the municipal borough of St Helens, bringing together the townships of Eccleston, Parr, Sutton and Windle.\nA year of celebrations are planned and on this very early evidence, that could include a day out at Old Trafford in October.\nSaints were white hot and most of what they did came off, but it was a grim night for Tigers.\nCastleford could not blame off-season changes for their lacklustre effort. Unusually for an opening fixture, there was only one new signing on show, Castleford giving a competitive debut to prop James Green.\nTeenager Jake Trueman was preferred to Jamie Ellis at stand-off and Joe Wardle was not risked due to a slight \u201cniggle\u201d picked up in training.\nAll Saints\u2019 players were at the club last year, but after a full pre-season under coach Justin Holbrook and with full-back Ben Barba now fully acclimatised, they looked even sharper than the team which finished last year so strongly.\nBarba is favourite to be named Man of Steel this year and the Australian showed exactly why in the opening half an hour, scoring one try, helping create another and then providing the kick or final pass for two more. In the second half he added another assist and his second touchdown.\nBarba was in support to cross after just four minutes when Mark Percival broke down Saints\u2019 left and drew full-back Ben Roberts. Then in the next set, James Roby powered through the middle, Jon Wilkin, Barba and Roby again kept the ball moving and Zeb Taia was on hand to go over.\nSaints added a third touchdown after 24 minutes. Barba\u2019s kick seemed to be going dead, but Alex Walmsley batted it back and Jonny Lomax touched down.\nReferee James Child indicated no try, but he was overruled by video assistant Phil Bentham.\nLomax landed a 40-20 in the next set, Tigers were penalised and from that Percival powered over from a show and go by Barba and the conversion made it 22-0.\nCastleford came out with more purpose in the second half, but without really threatening.\nSaints were comfortable enough to tap a penalty in front of the posts after 55 minutes and their adventure was rewarded with six points rather than two when Percival forced his way over from a pass by \u2013 inevitably \u2013 Barba.\nSoon after that, Saints prop Kyle Amor was sin-binned for raising a knee on Roberts in a tackle and Tigers took advantage to break their duck through Paul McShane, who crossed from Green\u2019s neat offload and Luke Gale converted.\nWith 13 minutes left Barba capped an outstanding display when he got across to shove Greg Eden into touch, then scored his second try \u2013 which Richardson improved \u2013 in the resulting set.\nBarba\u2019s pass almost set up a late score for Regan Grace, but \u2013after Child indicated a try \u2013 Bentham spotted a hand in touch.\nEven so, Saints added back-to-back tries in the final moments as Taia scored his second and Percival completed a hat-trick to end a miserable night for Tigers.\nSt Helens: Barba, Makinson, Morgan.,Percival, Grace, Lomax, Richardson, Amor, Roby, Thompson, Peyroux, Taia, Wilkin. Substitutes: Fages, Walmsley, McCarthy-Scarsbrook, Knowles.\nCastleford Tigers: Roberts, Minikin, Webster, Shenton, Eden, Trueman, Gale, Moors, McShane, Green, Holmes, McMeeken, Massey. Substitutes: Millington,Milner, Sene-Lefao, Cook.\nReferee: J Child (Batley)."}

Along the way, it has severely disrupted our traditional methods of communication, transportation and, yes, even education, both higher and lower.\nAgainst that backdrop, Linfield College has just entrusted its future to Miles Davis, dean of the school of business at Virginia\u2019s Shenandoah University, who is almost universally described by colleagues as affable, unflappable, entrepreneurial and charismatic.\nWe see in Davis a person willing to ride the winds of change while infusing others with the courage to join him. And those characteristics seem to us exactly what today\u2019s turbulent times demand.\nIn a phone interview conducted from a business conference in Phoenix, Davis told reporter Starla Pointer, \u201cEntrepreneurship is imagining a world that is not. It\u2019s asking questions. It\u2019s asking, \u2018Why are we doing this this way.\u2019\u201d\nWith that thought in mind, he said, he\u2019ll be bearing questions when he assumes the helm from Thomas Hellie in July.\nWhen he was named dean of Shenandoah\u2019s business school in 2012, Davis was perhaps even more pointed. He confessed in an initial interview:\n\u201cI hate the phrase, \u2018If it\u2019s not broke, don\u2019t fix it.\u2019 The problem is that you\u2019re becoming reactionary, you\u2019re waiting for something to break to fix it. I would prefer that we intentionally break something and rebuild it to make it better, because then we\u2019re actively engaged in a process that allows us to see when something needs to be broken.\u201d\nWith population growth sliding and job growth soaring, a dwindling number of high school graduates find themselves chasing an ever-expanding number of alternative educational and employment options. That is sending ripples through the nation\u2019s entire higher ed system, but perhaps being felt most acutely at private four-year colleges like Linfield.\nWith college tuition and debt surging ever up, students and parents are being forced to carefully assess cost-benefit ratios. That can make community colleges, state schools, online options, military service and immediate employment all look attractive.\nIn such a competitive environment, Linfield has to make a compelling case on merit, the only way it can maintain the flow of tuition revenue it needs to make ends meet.\nThat was not lost on Hellie. In his 2017 State of the College address last fall, he identified boosting philanthropic contributions and student enrollment, the linchpins of college funding, as his top priorities.\nBy then, Hellie had already announced his pending retirement. That made one of his other priorities helping to recruit someone ready, willing and able to seize the reins upon conclusion of his 12-year run.\nAssisted by a recruiting firm, the college\u2019s search committee drew more than 100 candidates. It narrowed the field to seven, four and two, by turn, before settling on Davis.\nOur initial impression is that the committee found a good fit between candidate strengths and college needs. Here\u2019s hoping Davis settles in for a long and successful tenure of his own."}

In 2014 he founded Hot Chicken Takeover, a community business bringing together great food and great people.

Reuters reported last week that this would be the bank's focus in the future.\nThat has helped drive the yield spread between Germany's two- and 10-year debt to the flattest in a year, while the gap between 10- and 30-year yields has narrowed 10 basis points over the past week. .\nThe moves in the German curve also follow the flattening momentum in the U.S. Treasury bond market, where the 2-10 yield spread has fallen under 30 bps at the tightest levels in over a decade,\nElsewhere, French 30-year borrowing costs are close to their lowest level in 18 months while the Italian 10s\/30s bond yield spread has tightened 17 basis points over the past week.\n\"This is hugely important because at the end of the day the amount of stimulus depends on the amount of duration the ECB extracts,\" said Commerbank strategist Christoph Rieger.\nHSBC reckons 10-year German Bund yields could end the year as low as 0.4 percent, slashing its previous 0.75 percent forecast due to global growth concerns and the recent flare-up in German political tensions.\nCentral bank buying of longer-dated debt magnifies the effect of the monetary policy as it incentivises long-term borrowing and, by extension, further spending.\nIt also allows countries and companies to term out their debt profiles and make them more sustainable; and the German state of Nord Rhein Westphalia looks to be the first to benefit as it plans a 50-year bond sale on Wednesday.\n\"The demand for 50-year is there for good reason, there's a lot of convexity value for pension funds, and for asset managers,\" said Rieger of Commerzbank.\nBelgium's Flemish Community was also in the market for a 20-year bond on Wednesday.\nBut on a day of thin liquidity due to the Independence Day holiday in the United States, euro zone government bond yields were largely flat.\nItalian yields were the exception, rising 2-4 bps across the curve, with analysts citing a risk-off environment on trade worries as the main cause for shedding low-rated Italian bonds.\nChina is putting pressure on the European Union to issue a strong joint statement against U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies at a summit later this month but is facing resistance, European officials said.\nMeanwhile, euro zone business activity nudged up slightly faster than previously thought last month, surveys showed but with firms at their gloomiest since late-2016, there seemed to be little hope for a more robust rebound.

(Photo: The Associated Press)\nOhio State agreed to pay coach Chris Holtmann two separate payments of almost $2 million each as part of his contract to become the Buckeyes basketball coach.\nThe details of the payments were revealed Friday when the school released its compensation agreement with Holtmann.\nWithin 30 days of the execution of the contract that was signed in December and approved by the Board of Trustees yesterday, Holtmann was guaranteed a lump sum payment of $2,040,360. The school also agreed to pay the income tax related to the lump sum outlay. In a response to an inquiry from USA TODAY Sports, Ohio State spokesman Benjamin Johnson said the amount was just more than $1.9 million.\nThose payments likely are tied to a buyout from Butler, where Holtmann went 70-31 in three seasons before being hired last June to replace Thad Matta.\nJohnson did not confirm whether the lump sum was used for the buyout. \"What Coach Holtmann does with the payment is his decision,\" he said when contacted by USA TODAY Sports.\nIf the buyout from Butler was $2 million, it would represent a significant higher figure than coaches at similar schools have been required to pay when leaving their jobs.\nVirginia Commonwealth received $500,000 and a home game against Texas this season when Shaka Smart departed to coach the Longhorns in 2015. The school received $1 million after Will Wade was hired by LSU last March. Also last year, Indiana paid a $500,000 buyout to hire Archie Miller from Dayton.\nBeyond the payments worth $4 million, the agreement between Holtmann and Ohio State calls for the coach to be paid $3 million annually as part of an eight-year contract that runs through 2025. He can also earn bonuses for team performance.\nPicked to finish 11th in the Big Ten this season, the 19-5 Buckeyes are second in the conference with a 10-1 record and are ranked 18th in the latest USA TODAY Sports coaches poll.\nIMAGES FROM THE WEEK IN COLLEGE BASKETBALL"}

Horrifying!) chance, you\u2019ve not seen either film, the basic premise is that mastermind criminal, Gru, adopts three orphaned little girls (sisters) as a front for one of his evil schemes. In the process, Gru\u2019s heart softens toward the siblings, Margo, Edith, and Agnes.\nThere\u2019s one scene in particular\u2014aside from every single minion scene\u2014that I love. Gru takes the girls to a carnival, where Agnes sets her huge, irresistible, brown eyes on a large, stuffed unicorn.\nClasping her hands, and staring up at the prize, Agnes, exclaims, \u201cHe\u2019s so fluffy, I\u2019m gonna die!\u201d\nShe had me with the eyes, but that line won little Agnes a place in my heart forever. Now I find myself repeating versions of the same line to whatever strikes me as being awesome and must-have.\nRight now Agnes has me thinking about the feast of the Assumption of Mary, celebrated on August 15 in the Catholic calendar.\nWhat does little Agnes from \u201cDespicable Me\u201d have to do with the Assumption?\nIt\u2019s this: The Assumption is the celebration of the Blessed Version Mary\u2019s being taken up, body and soul, into heaven. Upon her death\u2014either in Jerusalem or Ephesus, depending upon the source\u2014the Apostles buried Mary in a tomb at the foot of Mount Zion and not far from our Lord\u2019s tomb. Tradition from the earliest Christian times tells us that when the Apostles later returned to Mary\u2019s tomb, it was empty.\nNo relics of Mary have ever been found.\nThe Catholic Church teaches that, at the end of the world, all of our souls will be reunited with their once-earthly bodies, transformed.\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC 1052) quotes Paul VI in his 1968 \u201cCredo of the People of God\u201d (28):\nWe believe that the souls of all who die in Christ's grace . . . are the People of God beyond death. On the day of resurrection, death will be definitively conquered, when these souls will be reunited with their bodies.\nThat, so to speak, will be the moment of our \u201cassumption.\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s that moment for which we should be so desirous all of our lives that we live every single moment in anticipation of it.\nSounds lofty, I know.\nIt\u2019s not.\nIt\u2019s reality. It\u2019s the doctrine of our Catholic Faith. It\u2019s our sole purpose for existence. It\u2019s THE goal for which we should always be working\u2014the goal that supersedes all other goals of our lifetime. Not that we become suicidal or acquiesce to euthanasia. That, of course, would be a grave sin.\nRather, we need to be like little Agnes looking up at the fluffy stuffed unicorn, opening our eyes wide, clasping our hands, and with all of our hearts wishing for, longing for, desiring with all our hearts, to be with God in heaven forever.\nIn the sense of that kind of all-encompassing longing, we should indeed be able to exclaim, \u201cI\u2019m gonna die!\" We should look to the end of our lives in the same way Agnes looks at the unicorn\u2014as if it\u2019s the greatest good we could ever be given, because it is. We shouldn\u2019t fear death, but instead look forward to a holy death that will assure that, one day we\u2019ll die in Christ\u2019s grace, and become illuminated and transformed and granted Eternal Life.\nThey say that heaven is so wonderful that it\u2019s impossible for us to completely imagine. It\u2019s the most sublime prize that we could ever be awarded. It\u2019s beyond any glory imaginable\u2014even Agnes\u2019 is unicorn.\nAnd so, meditating on the Assumption of Mary, I\u2019m reminded that one day I hope to be in heaven reunited with my transformed body. Then I can easily think about my own \u201cassumption\u201d and, like Agnes, exclaim, \u201cI\u2019m gonna die!\u201d\nThis story originally appeared at the Register on August 15, 2016."}

The final amount is less than the $1.3 billion Brown Martel had sought for victims of the Ontario Scoop in which at-risk on-reserve Indigenous children were placed in non-Aboriginal homes from 1965 to 1984 under terms of a federal-provincial agreement.\nIn an unprecedented class action begun in 2009, Brown Martel, chief of the Beaverhouse First Nation, maintained the government had been negligent in protecting her and about 16,000 other on-reserve children from the lasting harm they suffered from being alienated from their heritage.\nBrown Martel, a member of the Temagami First Nation near Kirkland Lake, Ont., was taken by child welfare officials and adopted by a non-native family. She later discovered the Canadian government had declared her original identity dead.\nHer lawsuit, among some 17 others in Canada, is the only one to have been certified as a class action. Her suit sparked more than eight years of litigation in which the government fought tooth and nail against the claim.\nHowever, in February, Ontario Superior Court Justice Edward Belobaba sided with Brown Martel, finding the government liable for the harm the \u201960s Scoop caused. Belobaba was firm in rejecting the government\u2019s arguments that the 1960s were different times and that it had acted with good intentions in line with prevailing standards.\nWhile Bennett said at the time she would not appeal the ruling and hoped for a negotiated settlement with all affected Indigenous children, federal lawyers appeared to be trying to get around Belobaba\u2019s ruling. Among other things, they attempted to argue individuals would have to prove damages on a case-by-case basis.\nA court hearing to determine damages in the Ontario action, scheduled for three days next week, has been scrapped in light of the negotiated resolution, which took place under Federal Court Judge Michel Shore.\nOne source said some aspects of the many claims might still have to be settled but called Friday\u2019s announcement a \u201csignificant\u201d step toward resolving the \u201960s Scoop issue \u2014 part of the Liberal government\u2019s promise under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to make reconciliation with Canada\u2019s Indigenous people a priority.\nJeffery Wilson, one of Brown Martel\u2019s lawyers, has previously said the class action was the first anywhere to recognize the importance of a person\u2019s cultural heritage and the individual harm caused when it is lost."}

Episode three concluded Tuesday night, and episode 4 will be 8 p.m. Tuesday June 20.\nAmerica\u2019s Got Talent Season 12, Episode 3: Results, recap for June 13\nEpisode 3 was filled with touching stories \u2014 and weirdness.. There was a woman who survived a plane crash and has the voice of an angel. A 16-year-old who overcame blindness and sings like a crooner. But this week, there was one of the more absurd acts you\u2019ll see \u2014 a man who danced in a black leotard with a pumpkin on his head. Really. That happened. Twelve acts made the air this week, and one got the coveted Golden Buzzer, and it was easy to see why.\nAct. 1 Oscar Hernandez, the entertainer\nHernandez, a big guy, wanted to be an entertainer, but his father pushed him into sports. He tried to satisfy him by trying to play football, but that wasn\u2019t his passion. So Oscar broke out some wild dance moves to Anaconda, and the crowd went wild. He even did a split, showing the big guy is limber. The judges sat there, adding a little suspense, but then Simon broke the ice when he said, \u201cWell, we weren\u2019t expecting that.\u201d Then Howie cracked: \u201cIt\u2019s like you were possessed by tiny (Los Angeles) Lakers girls\u2026 When you do those splits does it hurt your pom poms?\u201d Four yeses, and Oscar was through.\nAct 2: Elena and Sasha, a balancing act\nSo what is this act? Elena explains, \u201cHe balances me on his face .. I wouldn\u2019t let anyone else balance me on their face.\u201d We would hope not. When Simon asked Elena why she entered the show, she quipped, \u201cI don\u2019t know, free sandwiches?\u201d She laughed and her husband, Sasha, just stood there a little dumbfounded because he doesn\u2019t speak much English. Sasha held a gigantic pole, in his hands at first, and twirled around Elena, then put the pole ON THIS HEAD, took his hands off, and they both twirled hula hoops. She finished off the act by doing a handstand. I didn\u2019t need the crowd\u2019s cheers to tell me they were going through. Heidi said, \u201cI think the two of you are absolutely incredible.\u201d The rest of the judges thought so, too. Four yeses.\nAct. 3: Shamika Charles, limbo dancing\nShe said she got her love of limbo from her mom. \u201cThis is my passion, this is what I was put on this earth for.\u201d And boy is she limber. Her mom came out and set the limbo bar for her. She did the limbo under a bar, under a bar by balancing a bar on her nose, and then under a car. A CAR! Howie mouthed, \u201cOh My God.\u201d The crowd screamed. The judges stood up. Simon said, \u201cI have never ever seen anything like that in my life.\u201d No doubt she made it through. Four yeses.\nAct. 4: Kechi Okwuchi, singer\nOn October 29, 2006, an ADC Airlines plane went down in Abuda, Nigeria. Some 107 people died, and there were just two survivors. One was Kechi Okwuchi, a 16-year-old girl who was coming back from her boarding school. Sitting next to her best friend, she heard a loud, shearing sound. She grabbed her friend\u2019s hand, held it tightly, and looked into her eyes for the last time. They found Keichi mixed up with the debris, burned, but with a pulse, and she has since had more than 100 surgeries. \u201cLaying in the hospital bed, with bandages head to foot, not being able to move or do anything else, music was my escape and that\u2019s why it means so much to me.\u201d Now living in Houston, she sweetly sang Ed Sheeran\u2019s instant classic, \u201cThinking out Loud,\u201d and it was a little hard to hear over the crowd\u2019s cheering. This one will make you choke up. \u201cYou are one of the most beautiful people I have ever met in my life,\u201d Howie said. Heidi simply added, \u201cWell, I love you.\u201d There was zero doubt. Four yeses, easy.\nAct. 5: Big Benji, singer\nBenchavan Shale, aka Big Benji, loves her some Simon. When he noted that she seemed nervous, she said, \u201cI know darling because I get excited when I see you.\u201d Big Benji, 73, belted out a version of the Frank Sinatra classic L.O.V.E. that was, well, interesting. It was cheeky, cheesy, off key, bad karaoke fun \u2014 but she actually ended up winning. No, she didn\u2019t get through to the next round \u2014 three judges said no as Simon gave her a sympathy \u201cyes\u201d vote \u2014 but she did get a hug and kiss from her main squeeze, Simon, See? Winning.\nAct. 6: Les French twins, magicians\nThere are some acts that defy description. Les French Twins are that. One of the twins started out on stage by himself, and then, through magic \u201csplit\u201d himself in two \u2014 though that turned out to be his twin. Then, through technology that had a virtual reality feel, they used a huge video screen to put on the most unique magic act you\u2019ll ever see. Simon started out with just \u201cUhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,\u201d before Mel B. called them \u201chilariously brilliant. Simon added, \u201cThis is 100% a Vegas act. This is really, really, really special audition,\u201d and they got four \u201coui\u201d votes, and sailed through easily.\nAct. 7: In the Stairwell, A-capella group from the Air Force Academy\nYou have to root for a group of men who are prepared to give their lives for the country and note how willingly they\u2019d do it. \u201cWe are military and we\u2019re being trained to be leaders, and music is a way to have fun together.\u201d And did they ever. They did One Direction\u2019s, Drag me Down, and killed it. The tight harmonies, the dance moves, the uniforms \u2014 well, killed it for everyone except Howie, who hit the dreaded X button and later said the act bored him. Mel B. came to the rescue: \u201cWith what you guys did with all the harmonies you made it feel \u2026 fresh and new.\u201d Howie stuck to his guns, but the other judges were impressed. Three yeses, one no, and the group moved through.\nAct 8: Wyatt Grey, comedian\nHe works at a hotel as a valet parking lot attendant, and thankfully he has a job, because Simon and Heidi, buzzed the Red X almost immediately. Thankfully, his act was short because you felt for the guy because it was so painful. He, and some others, felt the wrath of the judges.\nAct 9: Daniel Ferguson, the impressionist\nHe\u2019s a sales representative from Ohio, and he had what may have been the best act of the night. He sang Cake by the Ocean in the voices of cartoon characters Goofy, Scooby Do, Kermit the Frog, Mickey Mouse, Peter Griffin \u2014 and one non-cartoon character \u2014 Simon. The best way to wrap up what happened was with Mel B\u2019s comment: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this. You killed it. You nailed it. I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s brilliant.\u201d It was all of those, and he got four yes votes, and I\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t get the Golden Buzzer.\nAct 10: Pompeyo family and the most talented dogs in America\nIn week 2, we had Mia the Cockapoo who could count \u2014 and was amazing. This week, it was Pompeyo family \u2014 mom Natalia, daughter Katerina and huband\/dad George. Natalia said the family has 18 dogs at home, and brought four of them on stage. Their dream \u2014 a Las Vegas show. As their act progressed, Tyra Banks said \u201cso adorable,\u201d and ain\u2019t that the truth. I\u2019ve never since a dog do a handstand, balance on someone\u2019s hand, or walk on their front legs. The dogs also jumped rope, jumped through a hula hoop \u2014 all sorts of stuff. Yeah, Mia, has some serious competition. Simon said he could see the family in a reality show, and he was serious. \u201cThis is big,\u201d he said. Four yeses.\nAct 11: Dancing Pumpkin Man\nA man wearing a pumpkin on his head and dancing? It looked like the dancing version of the movie, Frank, in which the lead character, a musician, wears a paper mache mask all the time. It quickly became evident that this was a comedy routine, not a serious dance act, because who can be serious wearing a pumpkin head and black leotard? He danced to the song, I always feel like someone\u2019s watching me, but there was real doubt whether anyone would be watching Pumpkin Man anytime soon. Watching some inexplicable gyrations, Simon buzzed in no, but the other judges were cracking up. Mel B actually stood and cheered. \u201cOh my God that was incredible,\u201d she said. While Howie agreed, Simon and Heidi said uh-uh. But Mel B. stuck to her guns, ran on stage and said she wasn\u2019t leaving until someone changed their vote. Simon relented, and with three yes votes, the most absurd act of the night went through.\nAct 12: Christian Guardino, singer\nAt six-months-old, Christian\u2019s parents learned he would go completely blind. When he was 12, they found an experimental gene therapy that worked and helped him regain his site, and now his dream is to became a singer. You could tell, from the music and the set up, that the now 16-year-old was going to be something special. \u201cI have a good feeling about you,\u201d Simon said. Simon must have ESP, or maybe a hint from the producers. From the first note of Who\u2019s Loving You, he, well, he killed it. Absolutely killed it. He sang that with the soul and passion of someone three times more experienced. Mel B yelled: \u201cWhat just happened?\u201d What happened was someone who could win the competition. Simon called him one of his favorite contestants he\u2019s seen this year .. \u201cNot only your voice \u2014 I just like you.\u201d The Golden Buzzer is the biggest prize of the early rounds, and Christian got one. He deserved it.\nAmerica\u2019s Got Talent Season 12: How to watch, TV info for Tuesday, June 20\nSchedule: 8 p.m. EST | NBC\nHost: Tyra Banks\nJudges: Howie Mandel, Simon Cowell, Mel B. and Heidi Klum\nAuditions continue over the next few weeks:\nTuesday, June 20 | 8 p.m. EST | NBC\nTuesday, June 27 | 8 p.m. EST | NBC\nTuesday, July 4 | 8 p.m. EST | NBC\nJudge cuts will begin in July, followed by live shows and results episodes.\nAmerica\u2019s Got Talent Season 12, Episode 2: Results, recap for June 6\nThis could have been \u201cpull at the heartstrings\u201d week on AGT. Among the contestants \u2014 a singer who wrote a song for a woman in a bad relationship; a 9-year-old girl who nearly died; and a musician who lost her hearing and feared she would never sing again. It\u2019s not fair, folks, that there was no hankie warning for this one.\nBut just as these touching moments were the serious highlights, there were also the silly ones, led by a guy who did a hand balancing act with an inflatable doll.\nEdna\u2019s last name is Moore, and she named her dog Mia Moore (get it) \u2014 the love of her life. She calls her the K-9 Einstein. Mia, Edna Moore said, can count any number between one and 50, and reads flash cards. Yeah right, I thought. And, at first, Mia proved my skepticism when Eden asked her to count to four, and Mia appeared to come down with a case of doggie stage fright. But then, Mia the cockapoo counted to four (by barking), and then all the way to 16. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing,\u201d Howie said. Then Mia looked at a flashcard that said \u201c20,\u201d and damn if that dog didn\u2019t bark 20 times. Even Simon gave the K-9 Einstein a standing ovation, said he was blown away and called Mia a \u201cSuper Dog.\u201d When Simon asked if Mia wanted four yeses, of course she barked four times. She sailed through to the next round.\nAct 2: Diavolo, Architect in Motion\nDiablo is a very large performance group that does a combination of dance and gymnastics on a moving structure. That does not go near far enough in describing how amazing the act was. The dancers jumped on an arch-looking structure that moved side-to-side, and the dancers took turns dancing and jumping through the air. \u201cOh my God! Mel B. yelled after one particularly scary leap. Howie said, \u201cYou guys took it beyond the next level. I\u2019ve never quite seen anything like this in my life.\u201d No surprise they sailed through with four yeses.\nAct 3: Chase Goehring, 21, musician\nIt\u2019s tough on musicians on these shows. You have to separate yourself and be really original. Chase Goehring, a 21-year-old singer\/songwriter from a small town in Tennessee, blew originality out of the water. The guitarist performed a song he wrote, \u201cHurt,\u201d about a girl in a bad relationship he wishes was with him. The redhead had a little Ed Sheeran in him (in style anyway), and while the beginning of the song was, eh, OK, he blew away everyone when he broke out in a power rap that was, well, original (no pun intended). The judges were equally impressed,and all four gave him a standing ovation. Even Simon said, \u201cWow,\u201d followed by, \u201cIt was bloody fantastic. You did something I genuinely wasn\u2019t expecting in the middle \u2026\u201d Four yeses, and he\u2019s through, too.\nAct 4: Jimmy and Judy, hand balancers\nThe dancers do a hand balancing act, Jimmy Slonina said. Before their performance, he was in a tizzy because his partner had yet to show up, and they were minutes away from taking the stage. But, when Jimmy, in a tacky red leotard that showed his underarm hair in full view, went on stage, he looked skyward, and Judy was descending from a rope above. Mel B. was aghast, and not because of the danger of the act; Judy turned out to be a blow-up doll. \u201cSeriously?\u201d Simon said, who didn\u2019t let 10 seconds go by before he pressed the dreaded red X.. But Jimmy continued on, balancing his head on Judy\u2019s face and smashing it flat. That was enough for Heidi to hit the X, too. Poor Jimmy, who then threw Judy through the air, and she deflated \u2026 much like Jimmy\u2019s hopes for moving forward. Howie called his act comedy \u2014 really, what else was this? \u2014 and he got some support from Mel B. But Heidi and Simon thought the act was just full of hot air. Their two no votes were enough to send Jimmy and Judy home, probably in search of an air hose.\nAct 5: Paige and Artyon\nEight-year-old Paige and 9-year-old Artyon are two cute little kids who did a dance act It started off really cheesy, to the tune, \u201cBarbie Girl,\u201d but it quickly turned into serious skill. The two little ones did some challenging ballet moves , including Artyon hoisting Paige in the air and twirling her .. but Simon hit the red buzzer anyway. You cad! How dare you crush the dreams of little ones? After the act, the crowd chanted, \u201cLet them through.\u201d Simon said the little kids needed more experience, and the crowd booed \u2014 loudly. This also set up Simon vs. the other judges. \u201cI love that you\u2019re still smiling even though he\u2019s so mean.\u201d Heidi said, referring to Simon. Simon is no match for cute kids with big smiles. Howie, Mel and Heidi said yes, and the two cuties moved on.\nAct 6: Nick Uhas, the science guy\nNick Uhas says he makes science videos for the internet because, \u201cScience is that cool.\u201d For his first experiment, he asked the judges to suck air out of a balloon, and their voices all changed so they sounded like Darth Vadar. \u201cSimon, I am your worst nightmare,\u201d Mel B. deadpanned. Mel B and Howie went to the \u201ctable of science\u201d and set off a chemical reaction that created a weird looking \u201cJabba the Hutt\u201d type blob, and then Howie dumped hot water in liquid nitrogen, which blew up in a bog white cloud. No one died in the pursuit of science, and all four judges said yes. We\u2019ll see more science in future episodes.\nAct 7: Billy and Emily England, acrobatic roller skaters\nBilly, 30, and Emily,27, think what they do is like ballet. The brother-sister duo must be close because in the opening, Billy brushed his long red beard with Emily\u2019s brush. Simon noted that they were on the British version of the TV show, and he was excited to see them, again. That was a clue of how stunning this act was. They got on a small platform, and did a bunch of death-defying spins and moves that made me dizzy just looking at it. Words can\u2019t describe what they did \u2014 especially when Emily\u2019s head came inches from the floor \u2014 and I didn\u2019t even have to wait for the final vote to know they would move on. Howie: \u201cOh my God. People at home don\u2019t realize how dangerous that was .. for us because we\u2019re so close.\u201d You blew me away.\u201d Mel B.: \u201cWhat just happened, seriously? That was just crazy, but crazy good.\u201d And is she right. Four yeses, easy.\nAct 8: Angelica Hale\nThe incredibly cut 9-year-old is a singer who overcame pneumonia that it ruined a kidney and she almost died. But her mother donated a kidney to keep her alive. So it\u2019s hard to root against her with a story like that. She also has a goal \u2014 to be the next Whitney Houston. Talk about dreaming big. So the little girl with the little voice belted out \u201cRise Up\u201d with such feeling and range she had the crowd cheering almost as soon as she opened her mouth. Simon smiled. Her parents cried. This is another one I didn\u2019t have to wait for to write \u201cyes\u201d four times because, well, she\u2019s that good. I mean, stop what you\u2019re doing and pay attention to her good. When she was done, she just smiled a sweet 9-year-old smile. \u201cOMG,\u201d said Howie. Simon said, \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t actually happen,. You\u2019re tiny, you\u2019re voice is huge. We may be looking at future star.\u201d When little Angelica said Mel B. was her favorite star, she rushed to stage and wrapped her in a bear hug. This one had all the feels. And yes, all the judges said yes.\nAct 9: Azeri Brothers\nThey have scars on their bodies. Medics were standing by. And no wonder. The Azeri brothers performed an act of strength, danger and pain that is, well, not for everyone. The brothers don\u2019t talk so we don\u2019t have names for them. But they did have some other guy dressed in black who did the talking for them. The act went like this. One brother rammed five nails through a board with his hands and two more with his head. Simon had a legit \u201cWTF\u201d look on his face. Howie was flabbergasted. Then one laid down on a bed of nail while someone placed a pitch fork on his chest and stood on it. That was enough for Heidi, who hit the red buzzer of death. When they placed a shovel on the neck of one of the brothers \u2014 and an audience member stood on the shovel \u2014 Howie hit the buzzer. Heidi said the act was, \u201chorrible to watch.\u201d Howie called it, \u201cA buffet of torture. I think this is too much too far. Somebody is going to die, don\u2019t do this.\u201d Simon had a different take:\u201d It was disgusting but I loved it.\u201d With Mel B. and Simon as yeses, and Heidi a no, it was up to Howie. He asked the crowd if it liked the act and when it clapped loudly, he voted yes. So the Azeri Brothers live another day.\nAct 10: Colin Cloud, magician\nMagic done right is amazing. The best tricks start with a simple premise that contains a twist that blows away the audience. That\u2019s what Colin Cloud did. He took a simple premise \u2014 a coin trick \u2014 and turned it on its head. He asked each judge to place a coin in their hand and then accurately predicted where to coin was. He then pulled of a neat trick when he said he heard, from the crowd, the words \u201cwhite,\u201d \u201ckitten,\u201d and \u201coscar,\u201d and he pulled, from a box, a little white kitten named Oscar. Judges like magic, and all four voted yes Colin Cloud is moving on.\nAct 11: Mandy Harvey and her interpreter, Sarah\nMandy lost all of her hearing when she was 18, and now, she\u2019s 29. She got sick and the nerves in her ears deteriorated, and she finally went deaf. But that didn\u2019t stop her from pursuing her music dreams \u2014 she\u2019d been singing since she was 4-years-old. Now, she feels the music through vibration, and she sang an original song called, \u201cTry,\u201d a homage to her desire to perform the music she loves so much. It was a beautiful, heart-stopping moment. Forget about the song, which she should release on iTunes tomorrow; her grit showed America what you can accomplish if you try. Before the song was over she had the crowd on its feet, and some in tears. Simon simply said, \u201cMandy, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to need a translator for this,\u201d and he hit the Golden Buzzer. She\u2019s going straight through to the live show. She deserves it.\nAlso made it through\nPelican 212, a band of brothers and sisters, did a rockin\u2019 version of \u201cWe are Family,\u201d and the judges were impressed enough to move them through. They were only on the show foe seconds, but here\u2019s a small bit of their performance.\nAmerica\u2019s Got Talent Season 12, Episode 1: Results, recap for May 30\nThe amazing 12-year old ventriloquist, Darci Lynne Farmer blew away the judges. What seemed to start as a standard \u201cthrow your voice\u201d ended up as much more. Instead of talking, Darci belted out a stunning version of Summertime that had the crowd \u2014 and the judges \u2014 on their feet.\nThe young performer earned the coveted Golden Buzzer when Mel B. bashed the button. That means Darci goes straight to the live show.\nThrough to the next round\nEver seen a chicken playing a keyboard? Now you have:\nOn the opposite end of that, how about a performer who risked his life by escaping shackles before 900 pounds of sand could fall from above and bury him alive?\nOthers advancing to the next round\nPreacher Larson \u2013 The stand-up comedian blew away the judges with a performance on his 26th birthday, and was so good Simon gave him time for one more joke. He easily moved through to the next round.\nYoli Mayor \u2013 21-year-old singer started off on a rocky foot when she started singing, \u201cI Put a Spell On You,\u201d and Simon stopped the song because he wanted to hear something more \u201cyouthful.\u201d So she belted out Ed Sheeran\u2019s \u201cMake It Rain,\u201d and that was so good she made it through.\nJunior and Emily Alibi \u2013 The brother and sister salsa duo performed a spicy number with so many spins it felt like the room was moving. They easily made it through.\nVisualist Will Tsai \u2013 He had four cards covering four quarters and somehow moved the quarters underneath the cards. He then, with a snap of his fingers, moved the quarters themselves before turning them into rose petals. Yes, he moved ahead.\nSinging Trump \u2013 He impersonated the President doing Uptown Funk. That\u2019s an odd combination, and it worked, moving him to the next round.\nMerrick Hanna \u2013 The 12-year-old dancer told the story of a broken, floppy robot through dance. At the end, you could hear Howie saying, \u201cI love that,\u201d and Merrick moved through.\nPuddles Pity Party \u2013 A mime, clown and singer mixed into one. Mimes and clowns are scary, and he made it even stranger by belting out an amazing version of \u201cChandelier.\u201d He sailed through.\nAmerica\u2019s Got Talent Season 12 Preview\nAmerica\u2019s Got Talent is back for its 12th season highlighting the diverse \u201ctalents\u201d Americans bring to the table. That talent can be anything \u2014 singing, dancing, juggling, magic tricks, you name it. While the talent can be silly, the prize isn\u2019t. The winner walks away with $1 million. Contestants need at least three yeses from the four judges (Howie Mandel, Simon Cowell, Mel B. and Heidi Klum) to move on to the next round. A hit of the \u201cGolden Buzzer\u201d and the act is sent directly through to the live performances.\nThere was some offseason drama that has led to a major change in the show. Host Nick Cannon, embroiled in a dispute with NBC, is out after eight seasons. Cannon, according to a 700-word Facebook post said NBC executives threatened him with termination because of jokes he told on this Showtime Special, \u201cNick Cannon, Stand Up, Don\u2019t Shoot.\u201d\nHis replacement is former model and now Hollywood icon Tyra Banks. We\u2019ll miss Cannon, and this is a good time to look back at some of his craziest moments from last year:\nHistory of the \u201cGolden Buzzer\u201d\nThe \u201cGolden Buzzer\u201d was introduced in Season 9 of AGT as a talent saver of sorts, allowing judges to press it once during the season, automatically sending an act to the next round regardless of other judges votes.\nIn Season 10, the Golden Buzzer was upgraded to automatically send a talent through past the Judge Cuts and directly to the live shows.\nPrevious America\u2019s Got Talent winners\nSeason 11: Grace VanderWaal\nGrace VanderWaal, a 12 year-old ukulele sensation.

But then you come back with time to spare and have a ticket. A Sacramento man says this happened to him and still isn\u2019t sure what why.\n\u201cI came out at 8:40 p.m. and I had a ticket that said I was ticketed at 8:17 p.m. and there\u2019s no way,\u201d Nicholas Snyder said.\nLast Tuesday, he got a $42 surprise on his car, just two minutes before his parking meter was supposed to expire.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just no way that I didn\u2019t put enough money in,\u201d he said.\nHe thinks the time on the meter somehow mistakenly reset. According to the city of Sacramento, each time a car leaves a parking space, the meter is supposed to reset to zero. The city says that ensures customers don\u2019t pay a higher second-hour rate for their first hour of parking as soon as they pull up.\nBut we wanted to know why Nick\u2019s meter would reset if he didn\u2019t go anywhere?\n\u201cThey just said that it isn\u2019t impossible to happen, that\u2019s all I was really told,\u201d Snyder said.\nBut what if it did? CBS 13 found out, back in 2015, the city of San Jose used the same brand of parking meters: the IPS M5 Smart Meter with sensors. San Jose told us when large trucks drove by, sometimes the meter reset to zero minutes and drivers were getting tickets.\nIn a statement, San Jose says \u201c..we\u2019ve continued to monitor our smart meter\/sensor systems, and we have developed internal review procedures that allow us to identify meter sensors that may need adjusting.\u201d\nAccording to a Sacramento city spokesperson, the same error couldn\u2019t happen here. San Jose\u2019s sensors are in the ground and more susceptible to prematurely resetting. But Sacramento\u2019s sensors are up on the post, inside of the meter. The city says they detect large metal masses like cars \u2013 but are highly unlikely to reset because of a truck driving by.\nAfter seeing several nearby cars get tickets that night, a skeptical Snyder wants the city to take a good look at the meters downtown.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think everybody was being grossly negligent that night,\u201d Snyder said.\nHere\u2019s a piece of advice: as you first leave your vehicle, take a picture of your meter with a time stamp. If you have an issue, the city recommends calling 311 while you\u2019re still there.\nNick checked his complaint online on Tuesday and found out the balance on his ticket is now zero."}

{"id":"41d03438-dc1f-4248-a8a8-d18aaed72a35","text":"For Tampa rookie Jacob Faria, his second MLB start on Tuesday night went very similarly to his winning debut against the White Sox six days earlier. In each outing he recorded a victory by pitching 6.1 innings of one-run ball. He\u2019s fanned 13 batters and allowed just shy of a baserunner per inning (0.95 WHIP) in his 12.2 total innings pitched.\nIn a year where good starting pitching is hard to come by, Faria (31% owned) certainly deserves to be brought in for a test drive by fantasy owners in anything beyond the shallowest of leagues. With a K\/9 rate above 10.5 in nearly 300 IP in Double- and Triple-A combined since \u201915, it\u2019s fair to say his K success for Tampa, thus far, is legit. But his 2.1 BB\/9 rate for the Rays is well below the rate of free passes issued in his stint in the upper levels of the minors (typically north of 3.5). And, while he\u2019s always done a nice job of keeping the ball in the park, he\u2019s also producing ground balls at a higher rate (48.5%) than what he did on the farm (typically in the upper 30 to low 40 percentile range).\nPitching in the AL East can be a thankless chore, especially for a rookie, but if Faria can continue to pound the strike zone and keep the ball in the yard, he should be able to carve out a home in the mixed league world because of his K upside. With Matt Andriese expected to be out until August with a hip injury, Faria has a wide open window of opportunity. But he probably won\u2019t be afforded too long of a leash as his former teammate in Triple-A Durham, Blake Snell, is keeping the pressure on Faria by producing a 2.53 ERA and 44 Ks in 32 IP for the Bulls since his demotion.\n\u2022 It was only last week that I was fielding, \u201cShould I cut Rougned Odor?\u201d questions. With a batting average barely treading above the Mendoza Line and an OPS that dipped below .600 on June 4th, it was a fair question in many leagues. That\u2019s quite the comedown for a player drafted, on average, in the top 50 of spring drafts. Of course, I was pushing continued patience with Odor, certainly an easier message to peddle in April and May than it is in the middle of the third month of the season. But with two home runs on Tuesday night against Houston relievers Chris Devenski (who hadn\u2019t previously allowed a HR since April 27) and Luke Gregerson, Odor looks like he\u2019s starting to turn the corner.\nOdor\u2019s recorded a hit in eight of his past nine games, and seven of his past 11 hits have gone for extra bases (4 HRs). He\u2019s not all the way out of the woods, yet, as he\u2019s posted a 20:0 K-to-BB ratio over his past 15 games (not that he\u2019s ever been much for taking pitches) and he owns just a .350 OPS against southpaws (64 ABs), who he has produced an OPS mark against (.772) the past couple years that was near-equal to that of what he did against righties (.800). Considering his history of slow starts \u2013 he played his way into a minor league demotion after an awful first two months in \u201915, and April\/May were the only months his OPS was under .800 last season \u2013 it\u2019s reasonable to think his success against lefties, and pitchers of any handedness, will continue trending upwards.\nOdor\u2019s was one of a few interesting multi-homer efforts on Tuesday night \u2026\n\u2022 Andrew McCutchen hit two home runs in a 5-2 Pirates win over visiting Colorado. He was hitting exactly .200 after an 0-for-5 effort at Atlanta on May 23rd. Since then, only George Springer and Aaron Judge have posted better roto tallies, as McCutchen has hit .400 with 5 HRs and a SB in that 18-game span. I\u2019ll admit that I was in the camp that felt as he\u2019d continue to slide after posting his worst full-season fantasy value in \u201916. But McCutchen has his batting average back above .250, he\u2019s on pace for 27 home runs and he already has as many stolen bases (6) as he had all of last year. I may have doubted McCutchen, but I never stopped rooting for him, so it\u2019s good to see him back in vintage form.\n\u2022 Minnesota opened up the can on Seattle on Tuesday, pounding the M\u2019s by a score of 20-7 (insert obligatory Vikings-Seahawks joke here). The Twins were led by the three home runs from Eddie Rosario, a player that I employed in the 14-team Yahoo Friends and Family League for a while (his tenure with my squad ended long before Tuesday\u2019s explosion, unfortunately). He\u2019s been on my radar ever since hitting 15 triples, 13 home runs and stealing 11 bases in a 122-game rookie campaign in \u201915. But the speed side of the equation has only receded since then, and he has just one steal on the year. And a .260-.270 hitter with mid-teens power who typically bats in the bottom third of the Minnesota lineup is not all that interesting if he\u2019s not bringing some of that speed to the table. So, while it was certainly a serve-notice kind of night for Rosario, I would have been a lot more excited if he had delivered a SB hat trick instead.\nRead More"}

He tried to shove himself on me. He tried to expose himself. He did all kinds of unpleasant things.\n\"But he didn't actually put his back into it and force me. You're like an animal wriggling away, like a lizard. I was doing anything I could to get the train back on the track. My track. Not his track.\"\nAccording to Thurman, she later confronted Weinstein about the assault at the hotel room and warned: \"If you do what you did to me to other people you will lose your career, your reputation and your family, I promise you,\". But that didn't deter him and he even threatened to ruin her career.\nThe mother of three also detailed another occasion that occurred weeks earlier in a Paris hotel room where \u2013 during an argument over scripts \u2013 the producer donned a bathrobe and had the actress follow him to a steam room. \"I didn't feel threatened. I thought he was being super idiosyncratic, like this was your kooky, eccentric uncle,\" she recalled.\nShe said there was another encounter, which she did not discuss with New York Times except to say it left her \"shaking\".\nThurman says that when Quentin Tarantino confronted Weinstein about the assaults on her behalf in 2001, he \"went from aggressive to ashamed,\" before giving her a \"half-assed apology\".\nWeinstein's empire came crashing down in October 2017 when more than 30 women including Rose McGowan, Cara Delevingne, Kate Beckinsale and Gwyneth Paltrow came forward to accuse his of sexual misconduct.\nWeinstein refutes allegations\nResponding to the Thurman's revelations, Weinstein issued a full statement denying the assault allegations.\n\"Mr. Weinstein acknowledges making a pass at Ms. Thurman in England after misreading her signals in Paris,\" the spokesman said in a statement to the Times.\" He immediately apologised.\n\"Her claims about being physically assaulted are untrue. And this is the first time we have heard those details.\"\nThurman, who worked on seven films with Weinstein including Pulp Fiction and the Kill Bill movies, had previously said she was too angry to comment over a \"tidy soundbite\" on sexual misconduct claims against the producer when approached by Access Hollywood.\n\"I am not a child and I have learned that when I have spoken in anger, I usually regret the way I express myself, so I have been waiting to feel less angry, and when I'm ready I will say what I have to say,\" she said."}

To paraphrase, you can do a lot of things to your employees, but one thing you must never do is mess with their payroll.\nThat nugget of commonsensical wisdom should have been at the very heart of the Harper government's 2009 plan to replace its 40-year-old payroll management system. No doubt Stephen Harper and Tony Clement, who would become the point person for what came to be known as the Phoenix system, would argue that was the case. But it didn't happen that way.\nIn 2011 the government awarded the contract to IBM. The project checked many Conservative boxes. It promised to save $70 million annually. It promised to allow cutting staff by up to 3,000.\nIn 2015, Harper awarded the contract for a new Public Service Pay Centre in Miramichi, N.B. In 2015, after critical problems, IBM suggested delaying the rollout.\nIn February 2016, the system went live across 34 government departments. Protests and problems immediately broke out. Unions urged the government hold off full implementation. The advice was ignored. Thousands of staff were underpaid, overpaid, not paid, had their income tax deductions and T4s messed up.\nThe price tag now? More than $1 billion. But that doesn't begin to address the hardship and stress on staff. More than 70 per cent have fallen victim in some way to Phoenix problems. Lives have been affected. Families harmed.\nThe Auditor-General this week released a report calling Phoenix an \"incomprehensible failure.\" Clement immediately claimed the report vindicates the Conservatives, but it doesn't. It is equally hard on the Liberals, who eventually pushed the launch button in spite of many warnings about Phoenix being broken.\nAn unmitigated, foreseeable disaster, and the best the two governments responsible can do is point fingers at each other. What an insult to all the people harmed, and to Canadians overall.\nThe most disturbing thing about Michael Ferguson's report isn't the ugly details about who knew what and when, or about the collective failure of two governments to act in the best interest of their public service employees. Rather, it's the damning revelation about the culture of Canada's civil service: \"There's something in the culture that makes people believe that they can't bring forward these problems ... It was very evident that this system was not going to work.\n\"In order to prevent an incomprehensible failure like Phoenix from happening in the future, the government has to understand which parts of its culture are causing that type of action.\""}

Or, at least, that was the fear-inducing narrative at the time.\nThe Bowman Avenue Dam was, in reality, a 20-foot-tall sluice gate, keeping a stream from flooding the lower-ground floors and basements of houses in a quaint village a short drive from Brooklyn, New York. As it was indexed by Google and other search engines, the gate's controls weren't too difficult to find. Not to mention that the attack was hopeless as the online controls had been disabled at the time. This was no fodder for bad Hollywood cyber scripts.\nBut beyond the hyperbole, it was a reminder that American infrastructure takes many forms, whether run by corporate giants electrifying metropolises or small organizations just trying to maintain small communities. Rob Lee, a former National Security Agency (NSA) intelligence officer and co-founder at critical infrastructure-focused cybersecurity firm Dragos Inc., wants to protect them all. And his company has just raised $10 million in a Series A round to do just that.\nThe biggest chunk of the money, $8 million, is coming from two investment firms: Energy Impact Partners (EIP) and Allegis Capital. DataTribe, a start-up \"studio\" that previously pumped $1.2 million into Washington D.C.-based Dragos, is bringing in another $1 million, with a handful of offers being considered for the remaining $900,000, according to Lee. He won't reveal the company's current valuation. The funding will go into expanding the team and spreading the firm's Dragos Platform technology. Built on the founders' knowledge of attacks on actual industrial control systems, it looks out for and acts on anything that looks abnormal.\nAn offer for Iran?\nFearing outside influence, Lee wasn't convinced by the need for venture capital until recently. His company already had the talent; Dragos' two other co-founders are also ex-intelligence agents who've spent time researching real-world attacks on infrastructure. \"I have never viewed the venture view of industrial security that highly,\" Lee told Forbes. \"I think venture has done well in other places, but when it comes to industrial security, we can\u2019t apply the same best IT practises and we can't apply the same sales tactics.\" But the need for outside funding came, in part, from customers pondering the long-term future of Dragos, added Lee.\nIt's not just America that will benefit from Dragos' expansion, says Lee. He says he'll help private companies working anywhere, as long as it'll protect civilians. \"Out tagline is 'safeguarding civilisation,' not just safeguarding the top 20 energy companies that can pay for it... it's about how can we bring protection to all the mom and pop energy companies too.\" Marc DeNarie, CIO at one of Dragos' lesser-known customers, wind farm operator NaturEner, says he's benefitting from deeper insight than typical IT products provide: \"If new devices come up, or interesting traffic, I can track it down with my vendor, and ask them what the heck those guys are doing.\"\nLee says geography is no barrier too. \"If it's the Iranian power grid, they deserve to be protected against everyone else as well.\" He isn't expecting a call from Iran anytime soon, however.\nTo avoid any conflicts of interest, Lee is turning down all public sector contracts. But he will continue to advise those on Capitol Hill on how to deal with the impending threat of hacks of the nation's power grid. It's a threat with which he's recently had first-hand experience, researching malware dubbed CrashOverride, believed by some to be the work of Russian hackers, due to its release in Ukraine.\nLee and researchers from anti-virus firm ESET believe CrashOverride is the most advanced cyberweapon aimed at taking out power supplies ever seen, even though it's impact in Ukraine over Christmas 2016 was minimal. The attackers behind it, known as Electrum Group, were thought to be using Ukraine as a lab for future attacks in other parts of the globe.\n\"We're very surprised to see they're very active, and it looks like some of the activity is going towards other sites in Ukraine,\" Lee added. Others could now plagiarize their work, he warned: \"Their attacks have become instantly replicable for other people in the world.\"\nThe competition\nDragos certainly isn't the only attractive cybersecurity player in the power grid game, nor is it the only one that can boast an impressive staff of former spy agency employees. Claroty, founded by former Israeli Defense Force cyber experts, came out of stealth last September, having secured a whopping $32 million in funding. Indegy, a other company full of Israel's ex-intelligence analysts, has also caught the eye of investors, with a $12 million Series A. And Darktrace, founded by former GCHQ and Cambridge mathematicians, recently secured a $75 million round after impressing investors with a digital \"immune system\" that promises to detect threats on any network, including those responsible for industrial controls.\nAccording to Dragos investors Sameer Reddy from EIP and Allegis' Bob Ackerman, Lee's recent experience gives him the edge. He was recently out in Ukraine, assisting triage efforts following the 2015 and 2016 attacks on the country's power grid, the first known episodes of their kind. Indeed, Lee thinks Dragos outdoes competitors by providing expertise on the ground, rather than just technology.\n\"In industrial controls, this is the A-Team,\" said Ackerman. With the threat of hacker-induced blackouts rising, the world may need more than one."}

But the Cats extended their conference lead to three games (two up in the loss column) over Creighton and Xavier with four to play.\nThe Blue Demons (8-18, 1-12) lost their ninth consecutive game and looked nothing like the team that fought the Wildcats right down to the final possession in a 68-65 Villanova va victory on Dec. 28 at the Pavilion. They shot just 28 percent in the first half Monday night and missed their first seven shots of the second.\nReturning to the area where he starred as a high school player, Jalen Brunson scored 12 of his 18 points in the first half in helping the Wildcats to a 39-18 halftime lead. Although the visitors made just two of their first 11 shots in the second half, they managed to extend their lead to 48-21 on Mikal Bridges' dunk with 13 minutes remaining.\nDePaul went on a 10-0 run after that to cut the deficit to 17 but did not get any closer until the final minute.\n\"We just got sloppy,\" Villanova coach Jay Wright said. \"We got sloppy with the ball. We got sloppy defensively. We just didn't focus on details, and they kept playing hard. You've got to give them credit.\"\nBrunson, from Lincolnshire, Ill., went 8 of 9 on free throws and contributed four assists, three steals, and set the tone.\n\"Every goal for me is to be a leader on the court every time I step on the court,\" he said. \"I just think I had to set a tone defensively and get a couple of steals, some deflections and set the tone. The offense just came to me. It was a real team effort. I had to step up as a leader. I thought our seniors did a great job of leading us as well.\"\nOf the seniors, Josh Hart scored 13 of his 16 points in the second half, and Kris Jenkins contributed 13 points, a team-high eight rebounds and three assists. Hart was limited to 11 first-half minutes because of foul trouble, but Wright gave him credit for \"coming out focused on defense and rebounding, battling and setting the tone for our young guys.\"\nOnce again, however, the Wildcats were beaten on the boards without Reynolds on the floor. The Blue Demons held a 38-32 rebounding edge and grabbed 11 offensive rebounds that led to a 15-9 advantage in second-chance points.\nFreshman Dylan Painter got 13 minutes of playing time as the seventh man in the rotation in place of Reynolds, and had two points and four rebounds.\nThe Wildcats followed a strong first half with 36 percent shooting and one three-point basket in the second, but were happy with the result.\n\"Any road win in this league is a good win and we played a great first half,\" Wright said. \"I was really proud of how we started.

She was thrilled to hear what the community had to say and looks forward to the next meeting on Thursday.\n\"The community is positive, and we want to be able to get the correct information out to them to be able to make this a successful bond, as our last bond was not successful and we want to ensure that we can get the whole community behind this. I think it's a really good message tonight, that they're willing to do that,\" Biggs said.\nBoard members are looking at a $34 million bond to be collected over 20-25 years just to make repairs to their buildings, which the district says needs to be done to improve safety.\nTuesday's forum had to be moved to Monroe Road Elementary instead of the high school due to a power outage.\nBedford Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Carl Schultz sees the need for updates, but also wants to keep them modest while the ability to do so is available.\n\"It's a modest bond that's focused really on infrastructure, on safety and security, and really on immediate needs,\" Schultz said.\nThis bond levy would affect every home in the district.

Authorities were unsure how many more people could still be trapped, but about 30 were reported missing, Bopage said.\nSoldiers were digging with backhoes and shovels, as relatives of the missing pointed out where their houses once stood amid coconut, mango and banana trees. Those homes now lay in piles of collapsed concrete walls encased in a wall of mud up to 8 metres (25 feet) high and mixed with plastic bags, broken glass and other trash. Bicycles and auto-rickshaws, the three-wheeled vehicles used as local taxis, were crushed or lying topsy-turvy.\nMore than 600 of the area\u2019s residents were sheltering in nearby schools, while 11 people were being treated at a hospital for injuries.\nOne auto-rickshaw driver described a narrow escape. He was returning home with his wife, two sons and daughter when they stepped out from his rickshaw and his daughter said the ground seemed to be moving beneath her feet.\n\u201cThere was a strong wind from the side of the dump, and my daughter shouted that the mound is splitting,\u201d Rasika Sanjeewa, 41, said Monday. \u201cSuddenly, one slice of the mound came crashing down. The whole area was shaking.\u201d\nDebris blocked them from fleeing immediately, but eventually they found a way out, Sanjeewa said. When they arrived later at their friends\u2019 home, where they had planned to celebrate the new year, they found it buried and their friends dead \u2014 a mother and daughter who worked as daily wage labourers.\nThe prime minister vowed over the weekend to shut down the dump, which has absorbed much of Colombo\u2019s garbage over several years amid heavy construction and renovations in the capital. As the garbage piled up, it began threatening the nearby homes, prompting residents to stage regular protests while complaining of health hazards.\n\u201cThese people did not choose to live next to a dump. But they brought the garbage in and made this place horrible,\u201d said rickshaw driver Dilip Mirmal, 34, whose home was spared while those surrounding were completely subsumed. He counted 23 of his neighbours among the dead.\n\u201cThis is a government-made disaster,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a mix of feelings \u2014 of anger, frustration and sorrow. We have been trying to protest and raise these issues, but no one was listening.\u201d"}

Their bound bodies were found in their Albert Street and South Road, Bourda home on Tuesday. Saying that it is deeply saddened to learn of the deaths, the ministry has called for swift apprehension of the perpetrators of the crime. \u201cOur senior citizens should be treated with reverence and the utmost respect; we at the Ministry of Social Protection call on all Guyanese to honour the elderly, respect and protect them, and hold them in the highest regard, as we continue to recognise the elderly in the month of October under the theme, \u201cStepping into the future: Tapping the talents, contributions and participation of older persons in society.\u201d The ministry said it hoped that the perpetrators of this crime are apprehended and the full extent of the law is handed down. \u201cTo the aggrieved families, the Ministry of Social Protection extends sincere condolences. May Constance Fraser and Phyllis Caesar rest in eternal peace,\u201d the release added.\nMembers of the South Road Full Gospel Assembly and friends and family of the elderly women were in tears Tuesday after hearing what had occurred. The women were found lying faces down in separate bedrooms with their hands and feet bound and mouths gagged. According to a relative, the house was ransacked, and items appeared to be missing.\nPersons who were close to the women said after several efforts to contact them had failed, they decided to contact the police, who made the gruesome discovery around 07:00hrs. The police believe that the incident occurred between 19:20hrs on Monday and the wee hours of the morning on Tuesday.\nReports from the police have revealed that a door of the upper flat of the two-storey building was opened. Relatives said this was the third time the women had been robbed. One recalled that during the last robbery, the intruders had made off with cellular phones and money.\nIt is also the second time they have been robbed after receiving their monthly pensions. \u201cThis is a real tragedy, because those women were basically helpless because of their age,\u201d said a pastor of the South Road Full Gospel Assembly, who pointed out that Constance had seven children but all lived apart. Caesar, who had no children, had been living with Constance for over 50 years. The police have launched an investigation into the double murder."}

In my view, reducing the already inadequate amount of green space in the townsite is without justification.\nWaterton is a jewel that Canadians and foreign visitors appear to have discovered. Waterton is also part of Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park. I understand that Glacier Park attracted more visitors than Yellowstone National Park in July. This has never happened before.\nWaterton benefits from this increase, as more and more people continue on north after visiting Glacier. It is therefore important we get it right while we renew and rebuild. This past summer, the park gate was temporarily closed for a couple of hours due to high volumes of traffic. Closing the gate is not the answer.\nThe fire did open up an alternative for the visitor centre at the park entrance. There appears to be ample space for buildings and parking, and if combined with a shuttle service to the townsite, much of the congestion in the townsite may be reduced. Shuttle services have proven very successful in other parks.\nThe environment minister can demonstrate clear foresight and genuine leadership by taking advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and call for a complete review of the Waterton plan that could serve all Canadians, and especially Waterton Lakes National Park visitors, for generations to come.\nW.R. Jacobson, Lethbridge"}
{"id":"e3c283e3-ec3e-4113-b35c-b73c0c6d8815","text":"It has been a year since we called on the First Minister to consider what was going wrong with the care system in \u00adScotland. A year after she sat down with young people from Who Cares? Scotland. A year since she decided to call for a Root and Branch Review of the Care System (now known as the Independent Care Review).\nOne year on, the First Minister has shown she will not wait for the review to conclude but will look to make improvements throughout its \u00adjourney.\nFollowing moves from North \u00adAyrshire Council, who had been \u00adcalling for an exemption to council tax for young people who have been in care, the First Minister announced this as a Scotland-wide policy. It\u2019s an excellent sign that we are not \u00adwaiting until the end of the Independent Care Review to take action.\nImmediate action to fix current \u00adinequalities is a great leap forward. However, we hope that at the conclusion of the care review this inequality won\u2019t exist.\nMake no mistake, this was an immeasurably powerful commitment from the First Minister. The care system has been in existence for 150 years and there has been change.\nHowever, it has always been change within the current construct. We still haven\u2019t solved how to care for young people in Scotland whose own \u00adparents aren\u2019t able to. The \u00adcurrent Review of Care in \u00adScotland has the capacity to make a radical change however. A radical change to how people are cared for in Scotland.\nOutcomes, at present, for care-experienced people are shockingly poor. The statistics show that 45 per cent of children in care are diagnosed as having a mental health disorder.\nIn residential units, research shows that 39 per cent of children have self-harmed. Part of the problem is in how we deliver care and in the language around care. Homes are referred to as units or placements. Those who are meant to love and support you are called staff. Language matters and it\u2019s never neutral. It\u2019s not just mental health that \u00adsuffers. Care-experienced \u00adpeople are less likely to achieve high school \u00adqualifications, less likely to go to \u00aduniversity and more \u00adlikely to end up in prison.\nWith many \u00adchildren \u00adexperiencing as many as ten \u00adplacement moves in their care journey, it\u2019s easy to see why they may struggle at school and why they \u00adstruggle at home and in the \u00adcommunities they find themselves being moved into.\nOur members tell us that they feel like they live in a system that takes care of everything as a means of \u00admanaging risk. A system which doesn\u2019t reflect the process of growing up in a traditional family home. A system without love. This can leave them exposed in a world where, when they turn 21, they find themselves having to deal with the harsh realities of life. In many cases, they leave a \u00adsystem which, in seeking to stop things \u00adhappening to them, hasn\u2019t been able to make enough things happen for them.\nIt is important that we deliver \u00adradical change.The average age of leaving care is 16 to 18 according to the Centre for \u00adExcellence for Looked After Children in Scotland but the law says young people have the right to remain in care until they are 21.\nEvery single month this year, one of our young members has died. Why, if young people have the right to stay in what they feel is a secure and \u00adstable environment, are they leaving five years before they have to?\nThey are swapping five years of \u00adsafety and stability for uncertainty. So, we hope that the review examines what has made this happen. It comes back to love and how we care for our young people. They are brought up in a world of risk assessments, of logs that record their every move and behaviour. An environment that is alien to what a family home should feel like.\nYoung people want to be loved. They want the freedom to love people back. The status quo is presented as though the system is neutral towards the idea of love. It isn\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t talk about it at all, that\u2019s not neutral.\nLet\u2019s talk about how we bring young people up in an environment that is stable and secure but also, shows them that we love them. Let\u2019s talk about love.\nDuncan Dunlop is CEO of Who Cares? Scotland."}

Hickey went 1 for 2 from the free-throw line 36 seconds into the quarter and Moronchuk added their only basket with 5:38 to play as the Japanese defence stymied the Canadians.\nCanada finished the game with 21 turnovers \u2014 seven in the second quarter alone \u2014 while forcing only nine from Japan. The Japanese took advantage of Canada's inability to handle the ball, outscoring them 12-2 off turnovers while generating 23 more field-goal attempts through 40 minutes.\nThe Canadians started to find their groove early in the fourth quarter and cut Japan's lead to just two points with 6:35 to play, but the Japanese put together a 12-0 run to secure their place in the tournament's final four.\nCanadian coach Darrell Nordell rode his starting five the entire game until Moronchuk fouled out with 1:20 to go in the fourth.\nJapan's Takuya Furusawa led all scorers with a game-high 21 points.\nMoronchuk and Furusawa entered the contest 1-2 in tournament scoring.\nIt'll be Japan against Britain and Australia versus Turkey in Thursday's semifinals at the 12-nation tournament, with the gold-medal game set for Friday.\nThe Canadians won back-to-back gold medals in 1997 and 2001, but haven't reached the podium since.

Where our children grow-up, parents grow old and we collect a lifetime of memories, home is a feeling as much as it\u2019s a place. So, what do you do when your home is eyed by miscreants who prowl the neighbourhood night and day, plotting to break in? Here are a few pre-emptive measures you can take to make your home safe from burglars:\n1. Get inside the mind of a burglar\nBefore I break the lock of a home, first I bolt the doors of the neighbouring homes. So that, even if someone hears some noise, they can\u2019t come to help. \u2014 Som Pashar, committed nearly 100 robberies.\nBurglars study the neighbourhood to keep a check on the ins and outs of residents and target homes that can be easily accessed. Understanding how the mind of a burglar works might give insights that can be used to ward off such danger. For instance, burglars judge a house by its front doors. A house with a sturdy door, secured by an alarm system or an intimidating lock, doesn\u2019t end up on the burglar\u2019s target list. Upgrade the locks on your doors to the latest technology to leave a strong impression.\nHere are the videos of 3 reformed robbers talking about their modus operandi and what discouraged them from robbing a house, to give you some ideas on reinforcing your home.\nPlay\nPlay\nPlay\n2. Survey your house from inside out to scout out weaknesses\nWhether it\u2019s a dodgy back door, a misaligned window in your parent\u2019s room or the easily accessible balcony of your kid\u2019s room, identify signs of weakness in your home and fix them. Any sign of neglect can give burglars the idea that the house can be easily robbed because of lax internal security.\n3. Think like Kevin McCallister from Home Alone\nYou don\u2019t need to plant intricate booby traps like the ones in the Home Alone movies, but try to stay one step ahead of thieves. Keep your car keys on your bed-stand in the night so that you can activate the car alarm in case of unwanted visitors. When out on a vacation, convince the burglars that the house is not empty by using smart light bulbs that can be remotely controlled and switched on at night. Make sure that your newspapers don\u2019t pile up in front of the main-door (a clear indication that the house is empty).\n4. Protect your home from the outside\nCollaborate with your neighbours to increase the lighting around your house and on the street \u2013 a well-lit neighbourhood makes it difficult for burglars to get-away, deterring them from targeting the area. Make sure that the police verification of your hired help is done and that he\/she is trustworthy.\nWhile many of us take home security for granted, it\u2019s important to be proactive to eliminate even the slight chance of a robbery. As the above videos show, robbers come up with ingenious ways to break in to homes. So, take their advice and invest in a good set of locks to protect your doors. Godrej Locks offer a range of innovative locks that are un-pickable and un-duplicable.

Mike Rogers, according to a source familiar with the matter.\nInvestigators have also sought information from recently retired NSA Deputy Director Richard Ledgett, according to the source. Ledgett wrote a memo, according to the source, documenting a conversation in which President Donald Trump allegedly urged Rogers to help get the FBI to lift the cloud of the Russia investigation.\nLaw enforcement sources tell CNN that the special counsel is gathering information and considering whether there is evidence to launch a full-scale obstruction investigation.\nThe interviews are some of the first indications of the efforts of Mueller's newly assembled team. Ultimately, it would be up to Mueller to decide whether there is enough evidence to recommend pursuing charges on any part of the investigation.\nAny finding that could arise against the President would have another hurdle -- a longstanding Justice Department stance against indicting a sitting president. However, a finding of wrongdoing would likely be left to Congress to consider whether it warranted criminal impeachment.\nThe source who spoke to CNN would not say that the investigators were talking to the senior intelligence officials specifically about conversations they had with the President about the investigation, or other aspects of the investigation which also includes examining Russian meddling in the election and possible coordination with associates of Trump.\nA spokesman for the office of the special counsel declined comment. A spokesman for the DNI also declined to comment to CNN. The NSA said in a statement: \"NSA will fully cooperate with the special counsel. We are not in a position to comment further.\"\nAt a hearing last week, both Coats and Rogers said they were not pressured by the Trump administration.\n\"I have never been directed to do anything I believe to be illegal, immoral, unethical or inappropriate,\" Rogers said. \"And to the best of my recollection, during that same period of service, I do not recall ever feeling pressured to do so.\"\nMueller is already in possession of the memos written by the former FBI director, who documented each of his interactions with the President.\nMueller was on Capitol Hill Tuesday discussing the probe with Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr of North Carolina and Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, who is the committee's top Democrat.\nAfter the meeting with Mueller, Warner was asked by CNN's Manu Raju whether the committee is looking into obstruction of justice or if that was part of the special counsel investigation. Warner responded that \"the criminal piece of the investigation will be handled by the special counsel, but if we find facts we can turn this over to the special counsel\" and \"report them\" to Mueller's office.\nMark Corallo, a spokesman for Trump's outside attorney Marc Kasowitz, said in a statement to CNN: \"The FBI leak of information regarding the President is outrageous, inexcusable and illegal.\""}

Just 11 days later, unexpectedly large crowds would come out in New York and San Francisco for the first truly massive antiwar rallies. Back then, a protest of at least a quarter of a million seemed \u201cyuge.\u201d\nKing signaled another turning point by concluding his speech with \u201csomething even more disturbing\u201d\u2014something that would deeply disturb the developing antiwar movement as well. \u201cThe war in Vietnam,\u201d he said, \u201cis but a symptom of a far deeper malady within the American spirit.\u201d\nMany of those who gathered at antiwar rallies days later were already beginning to suspect the same thing. Even if they could actually force their government to end its war in Vietnam, they would be healing only a symptom of a far more profound illness. With that realization came a shift in consciousness, the clearest sign of which could be found in the sizable contingent of counterculture hippies who began joining those protests. While antiwar radicals were challenging the unjust political and military policies of their government, the counterculturists were focused on something bigger: trying to revolutionize the whole fabric of American society.\nWhy recall this history exactly 50 years later, in the age of Donald Trump?

In July 2019, his dream becomes reality.\nMorgan, who has always called New Castle home due to deep family ties in the community despite never having lived there, will be living and working on the International Space Station, orbiting 245 miles above the Earth's surface, as part of a seven-month mission.\nHe was selected by NASA to become an astronaut in 2013, with the expectation of going to space after spending close to a decade training. Morgan achieved a space mission in six years.\n\"It is a big relief, but also extremely exciting,\" Morgan said of going to space. \"When my class was selected five years ago, we were told it could be eight to 10 years before we would go to space. I will have flown to space within six years, exceeding expectations. Flying earlier is way better than flying later.\"\nMorgan is scheduled to launch on Soyuz 59S in the summer of 2019 and will serve as a flight engineer for Expeditions 60 and 61.\nHe was humbled upon learning he would be representing his country in space.\n\"However I am serving in space, I do it as a real honor,\" Morgan said. \"NASA has selected us to do this on behalf of the country and the planet. ISS is an international effort. It is the most magnificent example of international cooperation.\"\nTHE EXPERIMENTAL LIFE\nMorgan knows the nature of the experiments he will take part in aboard the space station, and his medical background fits perfectly into some of the projects.\n\"I don't know exactly, but I know in general,\" Morgan said. \"There are always experiments going on on board. It is a national laboratory that is constantly turning all types of science experiments - physics and biomedical make up the greatest proportion.\n\"Biomedical science I can speak to more accurately because of my medical background. We are the subjects of the experiments, and we are interested in how plants and animals respond to micro gravity over a long period of time. We want to explore space and we need to learn more about how our body reacts to micro gravity.\"\nSPACE TRAINING\nWhile Morgan will never stop training for missions, he is working to fine tune skills that will be vital during his time aboard the station, including learning a foreign language.\n\"There is very little I am training in that I didn't already have a foundation in during my initial candidate training,\" Morgan said. \"Our basic qualifications, we study the Russian language as English and Russian are the most spoken languages on the International Space Station. We do robotics training as we will work to capture visiting vehicles, support of space walks, which is another important skill I will continue to hone.\"\nWhile all the training requires strong focus, none more so than spacewalking.\n\"Space walks are very dangerous and a very important piece of work we do because of repairs that can only be done by astronauts,\" Morgan said. \"We study the systems of the space station and how to respond in emergencies.\"\n\"I am learning to live in space, how to exercise, how to maintain a food supply and steerage on board,\" Morgan said. \"There are a lot of things we have to remember.\"\nFIRST STEP INTO A NEW FRONTIER\nThe single-most exciting aspect of being on the International Space Station for Morgan is that first space walk.\n\"The pinnacle moment is when we go out, especially that first time,\" Morgan said. \"When I go out of the airlock and see Earth below me, that is going to be breathtaking.\n\"I think of all the things I will do in space, that is going to be the most demanding, physically and mentally. There are multiple space walks planned. I may do several. I am actively training with one of my crewmates who will be on board with me, who is a veteran Italian astronaut.\"\nAboard the International Space Station, the gravity is significantly less than that on Earth. NASA has a unique way for astronauts to train for space walks.\n\"One of the primary ways we train for space walks, we have a very large indoor pool, 40 feet deep,\" Morgan said. \"It is a neutral bouyancy laboratory with mock-up pieces of the International Space Station.\n\"We put on the space suit, we pressurize it, and it creates the illusion of micro gravity. We are supported by a team of divers that help take care of the tasks to make it as real as possible and to keep us safe.\"\nEXPECTATIONS\nSpace flight is an aspect of life few get to experience, and Morgan is ready to savor it.\n\"I am looking forward to just having a once-in-a-lifetime, seven-month experience with some great crewmates where we have trained together, depend on each other and depend on for our lives,\" Morgan said.\nBut, there is one opportunity Morgan is not going to let slip by.\n\"There is a window looking down on Earth, and we are doing an orbit every hour and a half, and I am looking forward to being able to look over the entire planet,\" Morgan said. \"I am definitely looking forward to doing that space walk. I have always relished a challenge, and this is one of the greatest I've ever faced.\"\nSOCIAL EXPERIMENT\nWhile Morgan is in space, he hopes he gathers a large following from western Pennsylvania on social media, especially Twitter, where it has become custom that astronauts share pictures of Earth from their high-arching perch in the atmosphere.\n\"I do expect to communicate some of my pictures and thoughts on social media,\" Morgan said. \"I would definitely like to have a following from western Pennsylvania and build interest in that part of the country.\n\"What is unique is that I will be launching on a Russian vehicle and there is a good chance we could see some of the early test flights of the next U.S vehicles from SpaceX and Boeing's CST starliner. Both could be making visits to the International Space Station, so that will be fairly historic.\n\"Those flights will be some of the first missions to have launched from U.S. soil since the space shuttle was retired in 2011.\"\nFAMILY TIES\nMorgan is the son of Dr. Richard and Janice Morgan, who live in Neshannock Township and are graduates of Neshannock High School. The couple returned to New Castle after Richard served 24 years in the military.\n\"When my Dad was in the Air Force, New Castle was home,\" Morgan said. \"There is where I went to visit my grandparents. I have four children of my own. New Castle is their home. They are coming home this summer to visit my parents. I have always thought of New Castle as home.\"\nHe is the grandson of Warren Morgan and Jeremiah Maher, who also served their country. In fact, Andrew Morgan is the first Army physician to be selected as an astronaut. His brother, Ben, served in the U.S. Coast Guard.\n\"New Castle is special for us,\" Morgan said. \"My children will be there this summer, and will likely be at Pearson Park fireworks on July 4.\n\"I never lived there, never went to school there, but it is home to me.\"\nOne thing about Morgan's love for New Castle is true, next summer he will get to peer down at the place he calls home from a vantage point few will ever experience.\n___\nOnline:\nhttps:\/\/bit.ly\/2z005i1\n___\nInformation from: New Castle News, http:\/\/www.ncnewsonline.com"}

Nor could she be sure of how the evening had ended.\nAll she knew, with dreaded certainty, was that her drunken behaviour would have made her once happy marriage to husband Michael more precarious than ever.\nNewly-separated Susan Worth (above), 41, says alcohol contributed to her marital breakdown this February\n\u2018By my mid-30s I was drinking at least a bottle of wine a night,\u2019 says Sarah, who at the time combined a demanding job as a chemical consultant with bringing up two children.\n\u2018I\u2019d black out and wake up feeling guilty. Michael and I had dreadful arguments \u2014 he drank too, but didn\u2019t make a fool of himself like I did \u2014 and after we\u2019d been married five years, he told me my drinking made me an embarrassment, and that he\u2019d leave if I didn\u2019t stop.\n\u2018At the time, I thought it was the cruellest thing he\u2019d ever said but it was the catalyst I needed to quit. If I hadn\u2019t stopped drinking, our marriage would never have survived.\u2019\nSarah\u2019s experience is symptomatic of a worrying trend among otherwise successful middle-aged women, whose heavy drinking is ruining not just their health but their relationships.\nRecent research suggests that wives\u2019 excessive alcohol consumption is contributing to as many as one in seven divorces, with the number granted to husbands on the grounds of their spouse\u2019s unreasonable behaviour \u2014 which includes heavy drinking \u2014 tripling since 1980.\n\u2018Men are more likely to be accused of having an alcohol problem, but the frequency with which wives\u2019 drinking has been cited over the last few years is marked,\u2019 says lawyer Laura Guillon of Hall Brown, the firm that did the research.\nPerhaps it is unsurprising, given our changing attitudes towards female alcohol consumption. The now ubiquitous \u2018wine o\u2019clock\u2019 has persuaded generations of middle-class women that a drink can take the edge off everything from work stress to domestic boredom.\nBut what was marketed as an innocuous \u2014 even desirable \u2014 habit has turned into a debilitating problem for many. One 2015 survey found women aged 45 to 64 were the most likely to drink too much.\n'By the end of last year I was drinking up to a bottle and a half of red wine a night to numb the pain of how unhappy I was,\u2019 says Susan\n\u2018I am inundated by professional, middle-class women whose relationships are on the rocks because of their alcohol intake,\u2019 says Sarah Turner, now 61, who stopped drinking and retrained as a cognitive behavioural therapist before founding alcohol treatment centre the Harrogate Sanctuary in 2000.\nShe adds: \u2018It is a hidden epidemic. Drinking is normalised as couples typically meet over a first date drink or share a bottle of wine with a meal.\n\u2018But women get drunk quicker than men because their bodies contain more fat (and fat doesn\u2019t absorb alcohol).\n\u2018They are also more likely to see drinking as an emotional crutch and seem to find it more difficult to stop drinking, which their partner often cannot understand.\u2019\nShe warns: \u2018Men can unwittingly act as \u201cenablers\u201d, escalating their partner\u2019s alcohol intake. To persuade a wife to stop drinking could limit a husband\u2019s freedom. After all, if a wife is drinking she\u2019s less likely to be bothered about what time her partner is coming home for example, so he will often persuade her to carry on.\u2019\nNot that we always need much encouragement. Whereas in the past heavy drinking was a pursuit associated with men networking with colleagues, it has now become ingrained in the fabric of many women\u2019s lives.\nA recent study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found that better educated British women are even more likely to drink heavily \u2014 one in five female graduates drinks at least twice the safe limit of 14 units a week, compared with one in ten less educated women. Getting drunk, meanwhile, is no longer taboo, but something to joke about at the school gates or to brag about on social media.\nAs Sarah Turner puts it, the problem is that \u2018wine has become a normalised form of self-medication for high-functioning, driven women. But tolerance to alcohol rises, and when women come to rely on it they feel ashamed and a sense of failure.\u2019 All too often, a wife\u2019s drinking exacerbates existing tensions in a marriage. \u2018Alcohol blurs the edges in an unhappy marriage, but also increases levels of the male hormone testosterone in a woman\u2019s body by 60 per cent,\u2019 says Sarah.\nHusband Bill (above right), 41, met Susan in a pub ten years ago after she\u2019d been drinking. \u2018We were very different,\u2019 she says. \u2018Bill was an intense book lover, whereas I was more of a party-goer, but back then he thought I was fun and charismatic'\nCarer Susan, from Bushey, Herts, admits her occasional glasses of red wine became a daily habit to help her deal with mounting claustrophobia in her marriage\n\u2018A drunk woman is more likely to pick fights. Then the guilt starts and she\u2019ll start drinking in secret, which creates a further rift. I had one client who would put her empty bottles in a neighbour\u2019s bin at 3 am so her husband didn\u2019t see she\u2019d been drinking.\u2019\nIt is not only women\u2019s higher fat ratio that means they get drunk faster than men. Scientists also believe their stomach linings produce less of an enzyme that breaks down alcohol before it enters the bloodstream.\nThe higher sugar content of drinks popular with women \u2014 a glass of wine contains one and a half teaspoons of sugar compared to beer, which usually contains less than one \u2014 also makes us more susceptible to blood sugar spikes and crashes, which play havoc with our mood.\nThe sulphites \u2014 or antioxidants \u2014 in wine, usually added as preservatives, meanwhile, can trigger unwanted side-effects such as sore throats and rashes in those with allergies.\nMuch of which resonates with newly-separated Susan Worth, 41, who says alcohol contributed to her marital breakdown this February. \u2018By the end of last year I was drinking up to a bottle and a half of red wine a night to numb the pain of how unhappy I was,\u2019 says Susan.

He accused me of being argumentative and we\u2019d go to bed in silence.\u2019\nBill started coming home from work later. \u2018I\u2019d stare into space with a glass of red wine in my hand, feeling sorry for myself,\u2019 says Susan, who has an eight-year-old son with Bill and a 15-year-old son from a previous relationship.\n\u2018The next morning, hungover, I\u2019d feel like a paranoid monster, embarrassed and guilty at how drunk I\u2019d got. I\u2019d bag up bottles for the recycling bin so Bill wouldn\u2019t see them, but he said he could smell it on my breath.\n\u2018I sometimes stopped drinking for a week to try to make him happy, but I resented him for it.\u2019\nMaria Hollis, an articulate housekeeping manager and mother of two from Craven Arms, Shropshire, only ever enjoyed the occasional drink until she reached middle age\nBy the end of last year, the couple were communicating largely by texts. \u2018It was a mutual decision to end it and I agreed to move out with the children,\u2019 says Susan, who now realises she was too quick to use alcohol as an emotional crutch, putting their relationship under added stress.\nMaria Hollis, an articulate housekeeping manager and mother of two from Craven Arms, Shropshire, only ever enjoyed the occasional drink until she reached middle age.\nIn 2004, however, her 15-year marriage to the father of her daughters Laura, 26, and Sophie, 19, broke down, and her mother Wendy died of cancer.

Drinking stopped us talking \u2014 all I wanted to do was sit at my computer on Facebook drinking wine. John began to point out I was drinking too much, but I wouldn\u2019t admit I had a problem.\u2019\nHer emotional outbursts became physical. \u2018I began to lash out at John over petty things like clothes left on the floor. I\u2019d scratch his face, push his chest and slap his arms,\u2019 says Maria, who at 5 ft 3 in was no physical match for her 6 ft 2 in fiance.\n\u2018He only ever looked at me with silent reproach. I felt dreadful and started drinking in the morning to deal with the remorse.\u2019\nDespite losing her appetite, the high sugar content of alcohol left Maria three stone overweight at the height of her addiction.\nJohn, a pragmatic man, admits being attacked by his fiancee was \u2018tough\u2019 but says: \u2018I knew the alcohol was behind Maria\u2019s mood swings, and could still see the woman I loved underneath.\u2019\n\u2018When friends noticed, I\u2019d insist I didn\u2019t have a problem, interpreting their concern as interference,\u2019 she says.

Perhaps drinking in front of John was a cry for help, but it was also because I was too addicted to care. I could see how much it upset him \u2014 sometimes he was so angry he wouldn\u2019t speak to me for days and any marriage plans were on hold.\u2019\nJohn\u2019s pleas for her to stop drinking became ultimatums. \u2018I told her to choose between alcohol or me. Maria said she would stop drinking, but never did,\u2019 he recalls.\nMaria adds: \u2018I knew I risked losing him, but I couldn\u2019t help it. Alcohol was my priority, as much as it made me bloated, with yellow skin and a heart that constantly raced.\u2019 The turning point was not so much her health as a realisation one Saturday morning in December 2014 that sobriety was an option.\nJohn\u2019s pleas for her to stop drinking became ultimatums. \u2018I told her to choose between alcohol or me. Maria said she would stop drinking, but never did,\u2019 he recalls\n\u2018I was at my computer with a glass in hand when I suddenly wondered what life would be like without alcohol. It sounds strange, but I\u2019d never considered I could give up before. I walked into the living room and told John I needed to stop drinking. \u201cI\u2019ve been telling you that for years,\u201d he replied as we hugged.\n\u2018Saying the words out loud made my intentions seem real.\u2019\nMaria\u2019s GP referred her to a substance misuse team who prescribed her anti-anxiety medication to help her withdraw and offered counselling. \u2018I was drenched with sweat and I shook and felt sick as the alcohol left my body,\u2019 she recalls.\n\u2018John brought me soup when I lost my appetite. It was incredibly hard, but knowing I could lose John gave me the determination to keep going.\n\u2018As months passed we started having fun together. For my 50th birthday last July he booked a surprise holiday to the States. Before, I\u2019d have spent the whole time wondering where I\u2019d get my next drink. Without that burden, I felt liberated. We would have split up had I not stopped drinking.\u2019\nDrinking has also become acceptable for mothers seeking to alleviate domestic stress.\nFor Tanya Robertson, 31, married to Harry, 34, alcohol was a way of coping after their first baby, Rose, became seriously ill.\n\u2018My drinking took the edge off a horrific situation, but caused awful arguments with Harry,\u2019 says Tanya, a product buyer. \u2018I\u2019d only ever drank socially before but quickly realised a glass of wine had numbing properties.\n\u2018I was at my computer with a glass in hand when I suddenly wondered what life would be like without alcohol. It sounds strange, but I\u2019d never considered I could give up before. I walked into the living room and told John I needed to stop drinking' says Maria\n\u2018Within a week I was drinking a bottle a night. At first I waited until Harry got home but then I started drinking earlier, at 5 pm, as I cooked tea.\u2019\nTanya adds: \u2018After a couple of months I was having a drink in the garden at 4.30 pm, pretending for a few fleeting moments that my life was normal.\n\u2018We\u2019d have huge arguments. I\u2019d shove him and he\u2019d shove me back. It was almost as if we were trying to push our grief out. Harry drank nearly as much as me, but as a man he handled it better.\u2019\nTheir daughter died of pneumonia last September, after which, Tanya says, \u2018drinking became more of a crutch than ever. Harry said I had to stop, and I knew it was ruining my marriage, but I refused.\u2019\nA month after Rose\u2019s death the couple were at a family gathering when Tanya\u2019s drinking spiralled out of control. \u2018Harry made a comment about people grieving in different ways and I took it as a sign of disloyalty. I\u2019d drunk a bottle of wine on an empty stomach and, incoherent, was screaming that he didn\u2019t understand me.\u2019\nA relative called an ambulance, which took Tanya to A&E.\n\u2018A mental health worker at hospital said I wasn\u2019t crazy, but that drinking was a cover for my grief,\u2019 she says. \u2018I was given monthly counselling, which offered an outlet in its place.

His team is setting standards never before seen in the history of England's top division \u2013 and doing it in style, too.\nStory continues below advertisement\nCity has won a record 14 straight games, and dropped just two points all season, to establish an 11-point lead after 16 rounds. They've scored the most goals (48) and conceded the joint-fewest (11) in the league. According to Opta, the official statistics supplier to the Premier League, City has an average possession of 71.6 per cent in matches, an average pass accuracy of 88.5 per cent, and has had more touches in the opposition box (616) than any other team.\nThose are the spectacular results of his work. But as important to Guardiola is the process.\nEven in the toughest periods of his first season as City, when the team was eliminated in the last 16 of the Champions League and clinched a top-four finish in the league only on the final day, Guardiola never wavered from his belief in the fundamentals of his philosophy.\nDominating possession.\nAttacking at every opportunity.\nTrying to win every game.\nHe often paid lip service to English soccer devotees who felt he needed to tweak his tactics to succeed in the Premier League, notably because of the intensity of the schedule, the weather, and the perceived high standard of the top division. Maybe he did so to downplay expectations, too.\nStory continues below advertisement\nStory continues below advertisement\n\"I'm not going to change England and I don't want to do that,\" Guardiola said in January, when City was toiling amid a period of inconsistent results midway through last season. \"Of course, it's going to change me. That's why I came here \u2013 to be changed.\"\nIn some subtle aspects, perhaps he has changed. He's recognized the importance of the second ball, acknowledged that his team will not control every game for 90 minutes, grown to understand the difference with English referees.\nBut deep down, Guardiola was never going to change. His philosophy, developed at Barcelona under the tutelage of his mentor and one-time coach Johan Cruyff, was too ingrained.\nOnly now does he feel he is being vindicated.\n\"We are clear, we are open,\" Guardiola said after the win at Old Trafford. \"We want the ball, want to attack, want to try to win the games in the way we believe. The others can do whatever they want. My players want to play, want to attack.\n\"Sometimes they're quicker, sometimes they're faster, but they're not a team who try to look for something special. Because we are honest. We're going to face the opponent face-to-face, to try to win.\"\nStory continues below advertisement\nGuardiola has treated matches away to big rivals United and Chelsea in the same way he has any other side. And he doesn't hide it.\nCity had 65 per cent possession against United, which had supposedly regained its so-called fear factor at Old Trafford having not lost there in 40 games in all competitions, and had almost double the number of shots (14 to 8).\nIn September, City went to Chelsea and beat the defending champions 1-0 with a display that was even more dominant than that against United. In both games, Guardiola played a front three with two attacking wingers, and playmakers David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne in midfield.\nThere was no obvious sign of tailoring his formation according to the opposition.\n\"We came here, like we were at Stamford Bridge and all the games since I came here, to try to win,\" Guardiola said. \"And I'm so happy.\"\nLast season, Guardiola maybe placed too much faith in the ability of some City players who weren't good enough or skilled enough to carry out his orders. His full backs, for example, weren't technically gifted enough to move into midfield and either contribute to attacks or be an initial block to a counterattack.\nNow, after another spending spree last summer, he is close to having his ideal team.\nXavi Hernandez, a playmaker and captain under Guardiola at Barcelona, said upon the coach's arrival in the Premier League in the summer of 2016 that Guardiola \"changed world football\" and \"is one of the few people who can change English football.\"\nThe manner of City's relentless march to the Premier League title shows Xavi could be right.\nWhen he was presented as City manager in July 2016, Guardiola \u2013 in an attempt not to sound too arrogant \u2013 said that \"to come to the country which created football and believe you have to change something, would be a little bit presumptuous.\"\n\"I'm not good enough to change everything,\" he said then.\nMaybe he is."}

But that exemption expires at the end of this month.\n\u201cThe ability for our city to restrict the concealed carry of firearms in public buildings ends December 31,\u201d City Administrator Wes Jordan told the Prairie Village City Council last week.\nThe city will, however, continue to ban people from openly carrying weapons in city hall. The city will be updating the signage on the windows by its doors to note the new policy in the coming weeks.\nWhen it passed in 2013, the law caused particular concern for some officials in Prairie Village, where city offices, court operations and governing body meetings all take place in the same facility. Some members of the council were uncomfortable with the idea of letting people bring weapons into a room where court proceedings were under way. But at a cost of several hundred thousand dollars, the option of providing a secured entry point to the Prairie Village municipal building proved too expensive.\nOther area cities won\u2019t face the prospect of having the municipal courts open to concealed weapons. Shawnee, for example, is going to install security equipment at its courthouse, but will allow concealed carry on all other municipal property. In July, Overland Park began allowing concealed carry in city buildings aside from the W. Jack Sanders Justice Center. The Sanders Justice Center, at 12400 Foster in southern Overland Park, houses the municipal court operations, and is already equipped with a secured entry point that exempts it from the state\u2019s concealed carry law. Open carry is still not allowed in any Overland Park municipal building.\nFor other NEJC cities, though, HB 2052\u2019s Dec. 31 deadline will have no impact at all. Merriam\u2019s city ordinances, for example, already permit both the concealed and open carrying of weapons in city buildings."}

The Centre submitted, \u201c\u2026to devolve exclusive legislative or exclusive executive power on the Legislative Assembly or Council of Ministers of the NCT of Delhi would result in elevating a Union Territory to the status of a State, a demand rejected by the Constitution-makers on several instances.

It said that the aid and advice rendered by the Council of Ministers is \u201cnot binding\u201d upon the L-G, and that \u201che is empowered to form an opinion that differs from the opinion of the Council of Ministers\u201d. In such a situation, the Centre stated, the proviso to Article 239AA(4) comes into play, which provides that in case of such difference of opinion, the President\u2019s decision will be final.\nThe Centre also argued that Article 239AA(4) employs the phrase \u201cLieutenant Governor and his Ministers\u201d, which implies that it is the \u201cLieutenant Governor\u201d \u2014 and not the \u201cCouncil of Ministers\u201d \u2014 who is responsible for Delhi\u2019s administration.

Zeliang to resign or face further protests over his decision to conduct civic bodies elections with 33 per cent reservation for women.\nIn a related development, legislators of the ruling Naga People\u2019s Front (NPF) are in a huddle to discuss the \u201cchange of guard\u201d in the wake of the prevailing law and order situation in the state. The Nagaland crisis was on since January, after the NPF-led government decided to hold local body elections in 12 towns across the state.\nThe government later declared the civic elections as \u201cnull\u201d and \u201cvoid\u201d. Three persons were killed and many injured following clashes between police and the public, who were opposing the civic polls.\nOn Tuesday night, the legislators also met at the official residence of Zeliang and deliberated on their plan of action if the agitating groups \u2014 Nagaland Tribes Action Committee (NTAC) and Joint Coordination Committee (JCC) \u2014 further intensified their agitation.\n\u201cThere is a possibility of change of guard, if the tense situation in the state refuses to subside. Some of the NPF legislators have put in their signature to replace Zeliang with NPF President Sharhozelie Liezietsu,\u201d a NPF legislator, who wished not to be quoted, told IANS.\nWhen IANS tried to contact Zeliang and Liezietsu for their comment, they did not pick up their phones. In the 60-member house, the ruling Democratic Alliance of Nagaland coalition government, which comprises 48 NPF legislators, including suspended legislator Imkong Imchen, four Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and eight independents.\n\u201cWe are giving him (Zeliang) another three days time to resign gracefully.

We cannot allow a person who has blood stains on his hands and betrayed the people and the church to lead our state,\u201d Velie said.\nHe said the JCC and NTAC have also resolved that all apex tribe bodies should call their respective legislators to withdraw their support to Zeliang on or before February 17, failing which the tribe bodies would debar those candidates from entering within their jurisdiction in the next election. In fact, NPF legislator Neiphrezo Keditsu had resigned as Chairman of Nagaland State Mineral Development Corporation Limited on moral grounds since one of the persons killed in the Dimapur police firing was from his village.\nMeanwhile, normal life remained paralysed as the indefinite shutdown sponsored by the tribal bodies entered the third day on Wednesday after Zeliang refused to accede to their demand and step down. Their three-day ultimatum in this regard ended on February 10.\nThe state secretariat, state and central government offices, banks, educational institutions, shops and other businesses remained closed. National Highway-2, which connects the main commercial town of Dimapur with the poll-bound state of Manipur, was also affected. Volunteers were seen picketing the road to prevent traffic movement and the government employees from attending their official duties, even as security forces were seen patrolling the roads to thwart any untoward incident.\nFormer Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio, who is also the lone Lok Sabha member from Nagaland, briefed National Security Adviser Ajit Doval about the current situation with regard to the civic bodies elections.

{"id":"59bc5b4a-fd99-40c0-b73f-40e384450705","text":"FILE PHOTO: Trees cast shadows outside the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington Thomson Reuters By Andrew Chung\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - From the moment Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement from the U.S. Supreme Court last week, speculation has centered on whether his replacement would vote to overturn a woman's right to abortion.\nBut the individuals considered top contenders for Kennedy's seat have produced a sparse record of legal rulings and writings on the subject, which makes it hard to predict how they might rule in abortion-related cases.\nPresident Donald Trump promised during his campaign to appoint \"pro-life justices\" who would overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. In recent days, however, the president has said he will not ask candidates about their views on the subject. Trump has said he will announce his nominee on July 9 and that he will make his selection from a list of candidates compiled by conservative legal activists.\nOn Friday, the president said he had narrowed the field to about five, and sources familiar with the president's thinking say the top contenders are Brett Kavanaugh, a judge on the District of Columbia U.S. Court of Appeals; Amy Coney Barrett, who was named by Trump to the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals; Thomas Hardiman, who serves on the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals; Raymond Kethledge of the Cincinnati, Ohio-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals; and Amul Thapar, whom Trump named to the 6th Circuit.\nOf that group, Barrett, a professor at Notre Dame Law School before Trump appointed her to the appeals court, has attracted the most attention on abortion.\nShe has spoken publicly about her conviction that life begins at conception, and in a 2003 law journal article, she argued that courts could be more flexible in overturning prior \"errors\" in precedent. She noted that courts have struggled over when to keep \"an erroneous decision\" on the books, citing as an example Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a major 1992 Supreme Court ruling that upheld Roe.\nAdvertisement\nSome progressive groups have pointed to the article as evidence of Barrett's willingness to overturn Roe. But she has also raised doubts about whether the high court would ever overturn Roe, according to a 2013 article in Notre Dame Magazine.\nHer traditional Catholic beliefs became a flashpoint last September during her confirmation hearing in the Senate. \"The dogma lives loudly within you,\" Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said to Barrett during the hearing. Barrett told the senators that her faith would not affect her decisions as a judge.\nWhile little is known about Kavanaugh's personal views on abortion, last October he was part of a panel of judges that issued an unsigned order preventing an illegal immigrant teenager detained by the government from immediately obtaining an abortion. That decision was overturned by the full appeals court a few days later.\nDissenting from that decision, Kavanaugh warned that the court was embracing \"a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand.\" Litigation over the issue is continuing.\nHardiman joined an opinion in 2010 that overturned the conviction of an anti-abortion protester arrested outside the Liberty Bell Center in Philadelphia. Though the court said park rangers had violated his free speech rights, the case was not about the right to abortion itself.\nAdvertisement\nIn April, Hardiman allowed the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic order of nuns, to intervene in a lawsuit against Trump's plan to expand employer exemptions from an Obamacare birth control insurance requirement. For years, the organization has been at the forefront in challenging the mandate's legality. Though the case was not directly about abortion, groups favoring abortion rights worry that Hardiman's ruling signals his sympathies on the issue.\nDemocratic politicians and liberal groups have said they assume that all those on Trump's list of potential candidates would overturn Roe v. Wade, given that Trump has said he will only consider such candidates.\n\"I take the president at his word,\" said Daniel Goldberg, legal director for Alliance For Justice, a liberal legal advocacy group that has researched Trump's judicial nominees.\nLeonard Leo, a conservative legal activist on leave from the Federalist Society, is advising Trump on judicial selections, and he said no one asked the candidates about their views on abortion before they were placed on the list.\n\"These people weren't even talked to when they were put on the list,\" said Leo. \"No one was asked these questions and as far as I know no one has been asked these questions if they were brought into the process in the White House.\"\nAdvertisement\nRepublicans control the Senate by only a slim majority, making it important for Trump's nominee to win the support of all Republican members, including moderates.\nOn Sunday, Republican Senator Susan Collins said on CNN that she would not support a nominee who \"demonstrated hostility\" to Roe.\n(Reporting by Andrew Chung; Editing by Sue Horton)"}

Currently, a five-judge Supreme Court (SC) bench is hearing a collective case over a bunch of 22 petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the 2016 Aadhaar Act on the ground that it violated privacy rights of citizens. Last week, the five-judge bench extended the March 31, 2017, deadline for linking Aadhaar to mobile phones, bank accounts, tatkal passports etc, till it delivers its judgement. Earlier in July last year, a nine-judge constitution bench had held that the right to privacy was a fundamental right protected under Article 21. This was seen as a major blow to the government\u2019s push for Aadhaar.\nSince July 2017, privacy has been at the centre of Aadhaar debate. According to legal experts, there are three aspects to privacy issue: bodily integrity, information privacy and threat of state surveillance. Whether the act of collecting finger prints and iris scans violates the bodily integrity of citizens, and therefore, the fundamental right to privacy is an important question before the SC. Equally crucial argument is whether the Aadhaar Act violates the right to informational self-determination or informational privacy. An important aspect of informational privacy is whether citizens know what exactly is happening with their personal information and the manner in which the information shall be used. The third and forceful aspect of the privacy argument is that Aadhaar will enable the State to mount constant surveillance on citizens.\nApart from privacy issue, the necessity to have an Aadhaar card to avail benefits or otherwise is also a subject of litigious debate. In an attempt to make the Aadhaar an all-encompassing identity for authentication, the government has lately been adding a slew of welfare schemes and services to Aadhaar. The government has also made Aadhaar necessary for filing income tax returns. However, the apex court\u2019s order of October 15, 2015, said that Aadhaar cannot be made mandatory for welfare schemes. The court has restricted the voluntary use of the card to six schemes and prohibited the government from making it mandatory for receiving any other benefit or service. The SC has consistently maintained that Aadhaar is voluntary and not mandatory and there is no compulsion to submit it for availing services.\nTo start with, the Aadhaar project was introduced as an optional 12-digit identification tool in January 2009. The optional nature of Aadhaar had come up for discussion when the National Identification Authority of India Bill, 2010, was introduced in parliament by UPA-2 government. The bill was referred to the standing committee on finance which raised concerns over Aadhaar\u2019s security by giving an example of an ID project in the UK which was later abandoned due to high cost, untested technology and the \u2018changing relationship between the state and citizens\u2019. In response to the committee\u2019s concerns, the government stated that while the UK ID card was mandatory, Aadhaar number is not mandatory. The government also clarified that the main aim of Aadhaar \u2018is to enhance the delivery of welfare benefits and services\u2019. Things took a different turn when the implementation of the project \u2013 in absence of a legislative backing \u2013 was challenged in the SC in November 2012. Since then, Aadhaar has remained mired in complex arguments in court.\nSince September 2010, over 1 billion biometric ID cards have been issued. Speed was strategic and scaling things, as the then UIDAI chairman Nandan Nilekani had said in an interview, was critical to neutralise the opposition to Aadhaar. The biggest opposition to Aadhaar programme came from the current ruling dispensation: BJP and Narendra Modi, then Gujarat chief minister. Modi had alleged that the Aadhaar programme was a \u2018bundle of lies and loot to the country\u2019s treasury\u2019. Post-2014 elections, both Modi and BJP did a U-turn to become its key crusaders. So, from a severely critical stand against Aadhaar before 2014 elections, the Modi-led BJP wants to replace every other identity with Aadhaar as the single monolithic identity for all Indians.\nWhat makes Aadhaar unique from many other methods of identification \u2013 ration card, driving license, passport, PAN and voter ID card etc \u2013 is the 12-digit unique identity number that connects an individual to his or her address, demographic details and biometric information. This makes the opposition to mandatory use of Aadhaar on ground of privacy violation legally tenable, as Aadhaar gives the State too much information about individuals. Another credible argument against Aadhaar is the absence of stringent data and privacy protection system and legal provisions to deal with data theft and breach of privacy. However, even if one supports the idea of having a unique multi-purpose identity to weed out corruption and minimise inclusion and exclusion errors for various government welfare schemes, one can still question mandatory use of Aadhaar for the coercive manner in which it is being implemented and expanded to include several public and private services.\nAadhaar is intended to vastly improve financial inclusion and the administration of subsidies besides weeding out leakage and corruption, though there is no evidence that it has put a dent in corruption. There have been several reports of the poor and ordinary people being denied rations and other benefits due to either lack of Aadhaar or authentication-related problems. Having Aadhaar in itself does not guarantee access to government\u2019s welfare benefits. So, what\u2019s the rationale behind bringing those individuals in Aadhaar ambit when they are not recipients of any government welfare scheme?\nOne does not know what the SC verdict will be. Broadly speaking, there are two possibilities: either Aadhaar will be scrapped, or it will be saved. If Aadhaar is not junked, concerns over data security and privacy issue should be addressed adequately. However, if Aadhaar is saved, its use may be restricted to enhance delivery of welfare schemes, as originally intended. Given the many ways in which the Aadhaar system is broken, it should also be made voluntary again. Critics have warned about the danger of Aadhaar architecture becoming an instrument of mass surveillance and profiling of individuals in future. The court has also expressed its concern over it. Aadhaar has its advantages; but apart from the issue of its constitutional validity, there are other areas of concern as well.\n(The writer is an independent senior journalist.)"}
{"id":"38ce9e0c-c9b7-4379-b33c-63cc5a7b5685","text":"Halloween franchise actress Daisy McCrackin and actor Joseph Capone were subject to a brutal and violent kidnapping and ransom attempt last year. The three kidnappers, Andre Stewart, Johntae Jones, and Amber Neal, have all been indicted by a Los Angeles Grand Jury on charges and are facing as much as life in prison if they are convicted. McCrackin and Capone were kidnapped at her residence on May 3, 2017, according to the indictment. The kidnappers held them for a ransom of $10,000.\nDaisy McCrackin, who appeared in 2002's Halloween: Resurrection, and Joseph Capone were held for roughly two days by the kidnappers. They were trying to receive a ransom from McCrackin and Capone was pulled into the situation. Capone got the worst of the kidnappers' treatment as he was under threat of \"a substantial likelihood of death\" during the incident. He was deprived of food for 30 hours after being forced to strip naked and get into a bathtub at Johntae Jones' home. At one point, while trying to protect McCrackin, he was severely beaten, punched and kicked for attempting to aid the actress.\nAndre Stewart, per the indictment, \"did unlawfully and maliciously deprive Joseph Capone of a member of the body and did disable, disfigure and render it useless,\" during the kidnapping. There hasn't been any clarification on that particular detail as of this time. Stewart also cut and disabled Capone's tongue, \"put out an eye,\" and cut his nose, ear and lip, according to the indictment.\nThe kidnappers stole Daisy McCrackin's 2011 Lexus. To attempt to get the ransom, Johntae Jones and Amber Neal drove McCrackin to two different Bank of America locations. She was forced to pull out $100 and then wrote a check for the full $10,000 amount, which was deposited into the kidnapper's accounts. According to the indictment, Neal also forged a document transferring ownership of the Lexus into her name. Following the bank trip, McCrackin was dropped off at her home and called local police and informed them of what had taken place.\nAccording to the District Attorney, all three suspects were tracked down by police and arrested. Amber Neal was released following the arrest and it's not clear why she was released as of this time. However, she was taken into custody by police recently, which was captured on video and posted to Twitter. Authorities confirmed that the woman in the video was, in fact, Neal.\nNone of Joseph Capone's acting credits were disclosed, but he was described as an actor in the indictment. It hasn't been made clear if any of the harm he suffered at the hands of the kidnappers left any permanent or lasting damage. The indictment also alleges that both Andre Stewart and Johntae Jones were in possession of methamphetamine, which they intended to sell. Jones' and Amber Neal's bail was set at $1 million, Stewart's set at $2 million. A pretrial hearing is scheduled for July 23. This news comes to us courtesy of NBC News."}

For years, Amazon has merely referred to its Prime member base as being in the \"tens of millions.\" The company has used that language since 2013, leaving investors to speculate where in the 20 million to 90 million range the figure actually sits.\nContinue Reading Below\nBut third-party research firms are always happy to suggest some estimates. Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) regularly puts out estimates, with the most recent being from October 2016, pegging Amazon's Prime member base at 65 million. Meanwhile, we know that Amazon should have at least 66 million Prime members by now, based on the growth rates and figures that Amazon has disclosed over the years.\nImage source: Amazon.\nWell, the company has finally started to give clearer clues as to its Prime member base.\nSaying more while still saying nothing\nAmazon recently filed its 2016 10-K, and for the first time it has started disclosing a new category of sales called \"retail subscription services,\" which includes \"annual and monthly fees associated with Amazon Prime membership, as well as audiobook, e-book, digital video, digital music, and other subscription services.\" This metric totaled $6.4 billion last year, and has grown significantly over the past three years.\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\nData source: Amazon 10-K. Chart by author.\nIf we were to take the figure at face value and do the super-complicated math of dividing sales by Prime's cost of $99 per year, that would imply about 64.5 million Prime members. But it's not so clear-cut for a few reasons.\nFor starters, the average membership fee is impossible to calculate. Amazon offers discounted memberships for students; Prime receives regular promotions that reduce the fee, like a Black Friday deal in 2016 that knocked off $20; Prime is available in many countries, each with varying (and often lower) fees that are subject to volatile currency translation; some members may pay monthly instead of yearly, which costs more ($132 instead of $99).\nAdditionally, Amazon sells all sorts of subscriptions that likely fall into this category, from digital content to dog food.\nAmazon also accounts for the Prime membership fees it collects in different ways, allocating portions to product sales and service sales while amortizing those amounts over the subscription term; some of the revenue remains deferred, while the new metric only includes recognized revenue. Another portion of the fee is even allocated as shipping revenue.\nIn other words, while Amazon's new disclosure around retail subscription revenue provides yet another data point for investors to scrutinize and analyze, the company has done a good job of splitting up the allocation of Prime fees for accounting purposes in a way that still obfuscates how many Prime members there are. It's safe to say that memberships are in the ballpark of 65 million to 70 million at this point, and at the rate that Amazon is adding Prime members, it'll be less than two years until it changes its language from a vague \"tens of millions\" to a still-vague \"over a hundred million.\"\nFind out why Amazon is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now\nMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

This includes mobile phones but also objects actually embedded into our cities, such as traffic lights and air pollution stations.\nEven something as simple as a garbage bin can now be connected to the internet, meaning that it forms part of what is called the internet of things (IoT). A smart city collects the data from these digital objects and uses it to create new products and services that make cities more liveable.\nAlthough they have huge potential to make life better, the possibility of increasingly smarter cities also raises serious privacy concerns. Through sensors embedded into our cities and the smartphones in our pockets, smart cities will have the power to constantly identify where people are, who they are meeting and even perhaps what they are doing.\nFollowing revelations that 87m people\u2019s Facebook data was allegedly breached and used to influence electoral voting behavior, it is even more important to properly scrutinize where our data goes and how it is used. Similarly, as more and more critical infrastructure falls victim to cyber-attacks, we need to consider that our cities are not only becoming smarter, they are also becoming more vulnerable to cyber-attacks.\nSmarter cities\nAcross the world, cities are rapidly becoming smarter. Cities as different as Singapore, London, and San Francisco use technologies such as urban sensing (which captures how people interact with each other and their surroundings), geo-tracking (which records the movement of people), and real-time analytics (which processes the vast amount of collected data).\nSmart cities use these technologies to better manage energy and water supply, reduce contamination and traffic jams, optimise garbage collection routes or help people park their cars. A good example is Chicago\u2019s Array of Things project.\nSmart city initiatives don\u2019t just have the potential to help make life more liveable, they can help us better the world. In 2013, the Greek academic Vassilis Kostakos introduced interactive LCD screens which encouraged people waiting at a bus stop to help identify malaria-infected blood cells.\nBig data and privacy concerns\nIn the last few months, following the Cambridge Analytica and Facebook revelations, concerns over how companies use accumulated data has grown exponentially.\nBack in 2009, experts were already aware that stakeholders could collect personal information from unaware users. Opaque privacy policies and complex data-sharing agreements allowed companies to bypass data protection law and use collected data for undeclared purposes.\nBecause of the huge and detailed information collected by the internet of things (IoT) devices, smart city projects could lead to similar worries. Take, for example, the Cityware project, which demonstrated the possibility of mapping not just digital but also physical encounters between Facebook friends.\nCityware were able to track the movement and interaction of 30,000 people using their Facebook profile and smartphone Bluetooth signals.\nMost people tend to underestimate that the smartphone they carry around is a very powerful sensing tool. In order to function, your phone continuously shares data about your location, digital and physical interaction, and more.\nWhen this data is matched with further information collected from IoT devices and smart grids \u2013 electricity supply networks that rapidly detect and react to local changes in usage \u2013 it raises serious implications for people\u2019s privacy and right to self-determination.\nJust as you give Facebook the right to own anything you post on your profile, the data collected by online sensors across smart cities will be owned by a variety of corporations, including internet service providers (ISPs). Last year, the US Congress overturned internet privacy protection by granting ISPs the right to sell users\u2019 information, such as browsing history, to third parties.\nOnce most of your gadgets are connected to the internet, the same objects could inform companies what brands and products you like and how and when you use them. This means that all the data which IoT gadgets will collect, whether in your home or in your city, potentially can be sold to third parties.\nCyber security worries\nAs cities get smarter, our digital information becomes even more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. For example, ransomware, which encrypts information and then asks for a ransom to free it, can hit even the biggest data holders, such as the UK National Health Service (NHS).\nStakes are extremely high when viruses hit local authorities. The recent cyber-attack on the city of Atlanta crippled several critical systems across the city, including the police department. Europol\u2019s No More Ransom! initiative gives good advice on how to deal with this type of threat.\nAtlanta suffered ransomware attacks in 2018. Pixabay[index company=pixabay], CC BY\nHackers can take control of entire buildings or systems. The power blackout that left more than 225,000 people without light in Ukraine in December 2015 is an example. Working out who is responsible for a cyber-attack is always challenging but Russia was indicated as a potential suspect.\nUltimately, even with these concerns, embedding IoT into cities is a growing trend. To take control of what that means, people need to become better informed and more involved. The business models of stakeholders need to be scrutinized and their use of data needs to be accountable. Most of all, citizens need to be listened to on how they want their cities to develop.\nSara Degli-Esposti, Research Fellow, Coventry University and Siraj Ahmed Shaikh, Professor of Systems Security, Coventry University\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

Her body was dumped face down in a rice field and tied to a rock, after the taxi had arrived in the province. Mr. Rithy then broadened the discussion to talk generally about rape and women putting themselves in danger. Two men have been arrested in connection with Sovan Sokmalin\u2019s death, according to police.\nAfter women\u2019s groups organized an online petition against the presenter, Mr. Rithy apologized on air on Monday during his show but repeatedly defended his actions and said he was trying to educate women.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t mean the apology at all,\u201d Ros Sopheap, executive director of Gender and Development for Cambodia, said on Monday.\nIn a 27-minute video clip from his morning show posted on his Facebook page, Mr. Rithy insisted he meant no harm.\n\u201cI have no bad intentions toward anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now, I have to apologize to individuals or women who said that my words were not good, not correct. If it affected those people, I would like to apologize.\u201d\nMr. Rithy insisted he spoke in humor and his comments were meant to educate. \u201cI am thankful for the criticism and see all the loopholes that I did not think about. I apologize for the joking.\u201d\nBut Cambodian blogger Catherine Harry, who posted a video discussing Mr. Rithy\u2019s comments last Friday, said his apology wouldn\u2019t cut it. \u201cMost of the time, he was trying to further defend what he said just to save his own skin,\u201d Ms. Harry said.\n\u201cHe kept trying to dismiss his remarks as a \u2018joke\u2019 that meant no harm. The public, especially the media, needs to understand that such \u2018jokes\u2019 are not harmless. It perpetuates the rape culture, which has claimed hundreds of victims.\u201d\nThe activists now plan to send an open letter to the information and women\u2019s affairs ministries asking the government to issue a warning to Mr. Rithy, Ms. Sopheap said, and to write to Hang Meas TV suggesting they train Mr. Rithy to avoid such comments in the future.\nA petition organized by women\u2019s rights activists on Saturday demanding that Mr. Rithy apologize publicly and be held accountable to the government\u2019s new code of conduct for media outlets reporting on violence against women gathered about 1,500 signatures before Mr. Rithy appeared on television on Monday to apologize.\nOn the phone on Monday, Mr. Rithy said any request of further action would \u201cgo beyond\u201d what is necessary.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether they [the activists] really have the intention of helping women or not,\u201d Mr. Rithy said. Mr. Rithy added that he didn\u2019t believe his comments had violated the new code of conduct but added that he would follow any ministry advice.\nMoeun Chhean Nariddh, director of the Cambodian Institute for Media Studies, begged to differ.\n\u201cI think this is in violation of the code of ethics, not only for journalists but for the general public, for Facebook users, and even moral ethics,\u201d Mr. Chhean Nariddh said.\nHowever, he said that if Mr. Rithy continued to make similar comments, his station should take action rather than the government.\nMs. Sopheap said the activists hoped to submit the finalized open letter to the ministries today.\n\u201cI certainly don\u2019t think people should sweep this matter under the rug simply because he appeared in public and defended his words and action,\u201d Ms. Harry said. \u201cA joke is not funny when he\u2019s the only one laughing.\u201d\nsanders@cambodiadaily.com, sony@cambodiadaily.com\n\u00a9 2017, The Cambodia Daily.

That should be evident.\u201d\nRight-winger Rick Nash certainly felt it.\n\u201cYeah [I feel frustrated],\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, any time you\u2019re not having success and you\u2019re getting chances and opportunities, there\u2019s definitely some frustration.\u201d\nCenter Derek Stepan acknowledged that struggle as well.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let it happen,\u201d he said. \u201cJust can\u2019t have any panic in your game.\u201d\nIt was clear that there was something off about the Rangers\u2019 play during Game 3. Despite having the home crowd behind them, New York looked hesitant to attack the Montreal goal and passed up a number of shot opportunities.\nThe lack of aggression saw the Rangers record just six shots apiece in the first and second periods. They tallied just 21 shots all game, making Canadiens goalie Carey Price\u2019s job far easier than Lundqvist\u2019s.\nThrough the opening three games of the series, Lundqvist has already faced 29 more shots than Price, which is an entire game\u2019s worth.\nThere have been plenty of chances for the Rangers to bombard the Montreal net too, especially on the man advantage. However, that tentative play has left the Rangers snakebitten and 0-for-10 on the power play so far this series.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t get a lot of shots. A lot of one and dones,\u201d defenseman and captain Ryan McDonagh said. \u201cWe\u2019re not making passes in the offensive zone, just making hope plays.\u201d\nVigneault honed in on his best players and laid some of the blame on them.\n\u201cAt this time, right now, our fourth line is our best line,\u201d Vigneault said. \u201cSo our top players need to find their game and they obviously don\u2019t have it right now.\u201d\nThe Rangers did indeed feed off the energy exhibited by the fourth line. Center Oscar Lindberg had New York\u2019s best chance in the first period on Sunday when his wrister hit the post while Tanner Glass and Jesper Fast provided a high-intensity style of play during their limited time on the ice.\nNew York\u2019s first line of Chris Kreider, Stepan and Mats Zuccarello have accounted for just one goal through the first three games of the series. Third-line winger Michael Grabner already has two.\nAt the end of the day though, it\u2019s only a one-game deficit for now. A strong showing on Tuesday night can rectify any reservations surrounding the team and allow them to seize momentum for their trip back to Montreal for Game 5.\n\u201cThis is the playoffs,\u201d Nash said. \u201cYou have to figure out what you\u2019re doing wrong and get over it.\u201d"}

It's not for us to impose that vision. But I think we'll find out more about that tomorrow .\"\nThe official emphasized that Trump seeks to bring peace to the turbulent region, even as he has promised a far closer relationship with Netanyahu and Israel under his presidency. Netanyahu and former President Barack Obama repeatedly clashed, and in one of his final acts in office, Obama declined to veto a UN Security Council resolution condemning Israel's expansion of settlements in West Bank areas claimed by Palestinians as part of a future state.\n\"A two-state solution that doesn't bring peace is not a goal that anybody wants to achieve,\" the official said. \"Peace is the goal, whether it comes in the form of a two-state solution if that's what the parties want or something else, if that's what the parties want, we're going to help them.\"\nThe two-state solution has been a central aim of American foreign policy in the region for decades, and was embraced by both the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority. But in recent years it has appeared to be an ever-fleeting dream, amid demographic changes, settlement expansion, security concerns, and eroding trust between the two parties.\nThe official said that the prospect of a future meeting between the Israeli government and Palestinian Authority leaders would be on the agenda for Trump's meeting with Netanyahu. \"He's hopeful to bring the two sides together to discuss peace,\" the official said of Trump, adding the issue of Middle East peace is a \"very high priority\" for the new administration.\nTrump and Netanyahu will host a joint press conference in the East Room of the White House Wednesday, before holding a bilateral meeting and a working lunch. The official said the administration hopes the visit will \"usher in a new relationship between Israel and the United States \u2014 something that Israel has not seen in well over eight years, a relationship that will show there is no daylight, that we are fully cognizant of the situation that Israel finds itself in.\"\nThe official said that under the Trump administration, \"The posture that the U.S. takes at the UN under this administration would be to veto anything that is biased against Israel.\"\nThe official added that the settlement issue will be also be on the agenda for the meeting. Earlier this month, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in a statement that the White House did not believe the construction of new settlements or the expansion of existing settlements beyond their current borders would be \"helpful\" in achieving a lasting peace accord. The statement followed a day after the Israeli government approved an entirely new settlement construction in the West Bank.\nIran, its status as a state sponsor of terror, and its nuclear program, would be a crucial part of the discussion, the official said. Netanyahu was outspoken in his opposition to the Iran nuclear agreement under the Obama administration, though Trump has pledged to rigorously enforce the agreement, rather than abrogate it. Officials maintain that the agreement has rolled-back the \"breakout\" time for Iran to build a functioning nuclear weapon from a matter of months to a year.\nAlso on tap for the meeting will be a discussion of moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem \u2014 long a goal for Netanyahu and many pro-Israel Americans. While Trump repeatedly pledged support for the move as a candidate and during the presidential transition \u2014 and even considered ordering it moved immediately after he took office on Jan. 20 \u2014 the White House put the brakes on the effort after Trump was briefed by his aides and amid pressure from Arab allies in the region."}

Schneiderman said The Weinstein Company will release victims of and witnesses to Weinstein's sexual misconduct from any non-disclosure agreements.\n\"This is a watershed moment for efforts to address the corrosive effects of sexual misconduct in the workplace,\" a statement said. \"The Weinstein Company's agreement to release victims of and witnesses to sexual misconduct from non-disclosure agreements -- which my office has sought throughout this investigation and litigation -- will finally enable voices that have for too long been muzzled to be heard.\"\nTo date, dozens of women have accused Weinstein of abuse, following reports in the New York Times and the New Yorker last year about his treatment of women, including some of those with whom he's worked. Weinstein has been accused of rape, assault and other forms of sexual misconduct.\nHe sought treatment after the allegations were made public and through a representative has repeatedly denied allegations of \"non-consensual sex.\"\nThe Attorney General's lawsuit against The Weinstein Company, Bob Weinstein, and Harvey Weinstein remains active and the investigation is ongoing, the office added.\nThe bankruptcy filing comes after a deal to sell the studio's assets fell apart earlier this month.\nAn investment group led by Maria Contreras-Sweet, the former head of the U.S. Small Business Administration, had been close to acquiring all of the company's assets for $500 million but negotiations fell apart at the last minute.\nNews of the Weinstein Co.'s bankruptcy filing comes on the same day New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo directed the Attorney General Schneiderman to review the Manhattan district attorney's handling of a 2015 sexual abuse case involving Weinstein.\nThe investigation into the DA's action follows an open letter from Time's Up, the female-led organization formed in the aftermath of the Weinstein scandal, in which the group called for a probe into District Attorney Cyrus Vance and his office \"to determine the facts related to the decision not to prosecute Harvey Weinstein for sexual abuse crimes against one of his accusers, Ambra Battilana.\"\nBack in October, The New Yorker released an audio recording of Weinstein speaking with young model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez as part of a 2015 sting operation. The NYPD set up the sting after Gutierrez told authorities that Weinstein groped her the day before.\nIn the recording, Weinstein makes potentially incriminating comments to Gutierrez, but he was not arrested or charged with a crime at the time.\nAfter the tape's release, the New York Police Department and the Manhattan DA's office traded public finger-pointing. But on Monday, Vance and the NYPD released a joint statement reiterating their shared commitment to investigate and prosecute sexual assault cases.\nVance has also faced criticism for accepting a $10,000 donation from David Boies, an attorney who has represented Weinstein, in August 2015, according to campaign financial disclosure forms from the New York State Board of Elections."}

One American flag was burned.\nAt least five protesters affected by tear gas were carried away from the scene.\nProtesters told CNN they condemned Trump's steps on Jerusalem's status, and said they were angry at the \"impotence\" of Arab leaders in the wake of the controversial decision.\n\"Sheep who are the Arab leaders betrayed Jerusalem years ago,\" Mustafa, a Syrian demonstrator, told CNN.\nThe demonstration outside the embassy comes as Lebanese group Hezbollah plans to hold a demonstration Monday in the Beirut suburbs to condemn Trump's decision.\nTrump's move Wednesday to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and commit to moving the US embassy to the holy city has prompted international condemnation and sparked protests worldwide, from Indonesia and Malaysia, to Iraq, Jordan, Turkey and Egypt.\nIsrael launched airstrikes early Saturday against what it said were Hamas targets in Gaza, after several rockets were fired out of Gaza towards Israel. Two Palestinians were killed in those airstrikes, the Palestinian Health Ministry said.\nMore than 300 people were injured Friday across the West Bank, Gaza and Jerusalem, 50 of whom needed hospital treatment, during protests against Trump's decision, according to the Palestinian Authority's Health Ministry."}

Councilman Michael Peroutka, R-Severna Park, was the sole dissenting voice.\nThe vote capped a relatively calm budget season, which launched May 1, the day County Executive Steve Schuh unveiled his proposal for fiscal 2018. The budget covers county operations from July 1 through June 30, 2018.\n\"It was a very uneventful budget,\" Council Chairman John Grasso, R-Glen Burnie, said after the voting session, which lasted less than an hour and a half.\nIn a statement, Schuh called the final budget \"a major victory for our citizens and taxpayers.\"\nHis spokesman, Owen McEvoy, said the process was \"much smoother than in previous years\" \u2014 such as in 2015, when the council spent hours debating major policy changes, such as extending the life of county bonds.\n\"Very little was changed, unlike in the past,\" McEvoy said.\nCouncil members did decide to eliminate one of Schuh's proposed tax cuts, which would have exempted athletic and recreational facilities from the county's 10-percent admissions and amusement tax.\nCouncilman Andrew Pruski, D-Gambrills, said he wasn't sure that the savings from the tax break would be passed along to customers. He noted that the cut would benefit private businesses, including local gyms, paintball parks, shooting ranges and country clubs, such as Gibson Island Club and Chartwell.\nThe council rejected the exemption by a 3-2 vote. Councilmen Derek Fink, R-Pasadena, and Peroutka abstained; both said they were members of Chartwell Country Club.\nThe council did approve two other tax cuts, one exempting movie theaters from the admissions and amusement tax and the other repealing the mobile home space tax.\nCouncilmen proposed several amendments to the budget before the final vote.\nThe council voted to restore $252,000 in planning and design money for a controversial improvement project at Beverly-Triton Beach Park in Mayo. Money for the project in fiscal 2019, meanwhile, was reduced so that the county only has enough to pay for shoreline restoration. The remainder of scheduled funds \u2014 for construction of new amenities such as a bath house and new parking spaces \u2014 were moved to fiscal 2020 to make time for more community comment.\nCouncil members also sent an additional $2 million to split among renovation projects at three of the county's most decrepit elementary schools, Tyler Heights, Edgewater and Richard Henry Lee. Councilman Chris Trumbauer, an Annapolis Democrat who proposed the extra funds, said they come from other school construction projects that were finished under budget.\nThis story will be updated."}

But a few hitting errors from Osceola followed by a tip from setter Kaitlyn Nugent, a Morgan Kummer kill and perfect serving from Ellsworth secured the set win for the Panthers.\nThe second set started off similarly to the first with tied scores at 7-7 and then again at 13-13. The Panthers were able to create a more comfortable lead of 21-16 with the strong net play of Kummer and Claire Kummer's serving, which rattled Osceola's serve receive. Morgan and Claire Kummer each recorded two aces in the night's match. The two sisters also shared the spotlight in the back row where they both contributed 12 digs apiece.\nMore hitting errors hurt the Chieftains, and the Panthers were able to claim the second set 25-17.\nEllsworth seemed to get into their groove in the third set, and took a 5-1 lead before Osceola used a timeout to regroup. The Panthers were able to maintain a four-to-five-point lead for most of the match until the Chieftains crept back to narrow the deficit to three points at 19-16. However, the Panthers answered with Nugent setting up Morgan Kummer for a couple of quick points, which gave the Panthers the momentum they needed to seal the set and the match.\n\"I thought we played pretty well, especially in the first set.\" head coach Nicole Vande Berg said after the game. \"Our serving has been a struggle lately, but in set one we didn't miss a serve, so that was nice to see.\"\nVande Berg was also pleased with how her team hit against Osceola's \"big kids\" whose blocking has been a strong asset for the Chieftains.\nMackenzie Kummer worked her magic at the net, and recorded 17 kills and three blocks, leading the Panthers in both categories. Vande Berg said that the junior middle hitter is always a reliable blocker for the team.\nKaitlyn Nugent, Ellsworth's sophomore setter, added 30 assists to her team's win.\n\"Overall, I thought we played well. We have to get our passing up, but I thought our offense was good,\" Nugent said. \"Next time we just have to make sure we win\u2014not necessarily by more\u2014but just make sure we stay strong and not give up at the end.\"\nEllsworth vs. River Falls\nThe Panthers traveled to River Falls on Thursday, Oct. 5 to take on the undefeated Wildcats to end their week of play. This time, Ellsworth was the team sent home after an 0-3 loss.\n\"We know River Falls is a good team,\" Vande Berg said after Tuesday night's match. \"They were down at state last year, and I think they're even better this year, so we've got to mix up our offense to try to move their block around and work out some serve receive stuff so we're ready, and we'll do what we can.\"\nRiver Falls proved Vande Berg's Tuesday night sentiments to be true\u2014they really are a good team. The 11-0 Wildcats came out hot and created a dreadful match for the Panthers who lost the first set 5-25.\n\"We walked onto the court in the first game scared,\" Vande Berg said Thursday night.\nThe Panthers gained a little more confidence in the second set, and only lost by seven rather than 20 points, which ended with an 18-25 final score.\nThe third set was Ellsworth's best of the night\u2014the Panthers only lost by seven points (19-25)\u2014but the team would still leave River Falls with one more loss on the season despite their improvement as the night progressed.\n\"It was good for our team to face someone of that caliber and see what that type of offensive power looks like across the net,\" Vande Berg said after Thursday night's loss. \"It really pushed our blockers to communicate, understand blocking responsibilities and often times solo block.\"\nMackenzie Kummer led the Panthers with five blocks on the night. The junior Kummer sister also carried the team in kills (14).\nVande Berg was impressed with how her team played defensively, especially Mallory Bleeker who led the Panthers with nine digs. \"We made some really good digs and had some nice plays at the net, but we just couldn't turn those digs into offense,\" Ellsworth's head coach said. \"With the offensive weapons River Falls has, you have to make that happen or they will put the ball away.\""}

But that's because I like to travel with all the comforts of home, like my favorite blanket, a travel kettle, a yoga mat, and a giant bag of instant coffee.\nOf course, I equip myself with the proper devices to get the job done, too. CES is not a major smartphone show, so I get to have a little more fun with what I pack for the journey.\nHere's what I'll be bringing with me to Las Vegas this year.\nThe bag: Timbuk2 Classic Messenger\nI love this bag so much. I've had it for about five years and it's been with me all over the world. This well-loved Timbuk2 Classic Messenger can fit all sorts of things I'd need out on the road, including a few smartphones, a battery pack, all the cords and adapters I need, an extra shirt, a small makeup bag, and the case for my Snapchat Spectacles. Also, not only does this bag have a lifetime warranty, but you can customize the Classic Messenger in a variety of colors, patterns, and materials. I love having a one-of-a-kind piece of kit.\nSee at Timbuk2\nAlso inside: Timbuk2 Snoop Camera Insert\nAndrew Martonik and I clearly shop from the same place. I don't carry as much gear as he does \u2014 just a humble Canon SL1 and a 40mm pancake lens \u2014 but I like this little insert because it has ample padding for extra gear. I can usually stuff two other phones on one side and the Gear 360 on the other.\nSee at Amazon\nAnd finally: Snapchat Spectacles\nI'm going to be pummeling the Android Central Snapchat and Instagram accounts with content I record with my Snapchat Spectacles. These things are ridiculous and I paid way too much for them on Ebay, but at least now I have a story to tell \u2014 that I was a sucker for Spectacles.\nThe Spectacles are exactly the type of thing you'd wear to CES because it's the type of trade show where you don't have time to fumble around looking for the smartphone in your bag. Instead, you can simply press a button to start recording up to 30 seconds of video. There's even a nice LED indicator on the outside to let people around you know what you're up to.\nAlso, they block the sun.\nSee at Ebay\nThe phone: Pixel XL\nI like wielding a big phone. It means I always have a large enough screen to read, tap notes, and respond to emails and Slacks and Hangouts and text messages and \u2014 you get the gist. I also love the Pixel XL for its looks \u2014 CES is a dog and pony show after all, and I'm merely showing off a powerful little \"get 'er done\" tool. Mine is really blue and I think it looks pretty neat paired with this cheapo phone case I purchased from the depths of AliExpress.\nThe 12-megapixel camera on the Pixel XL also makes it a reliable point-and-snap device. It produces fabulous low light shots and backs them up immediately to Google Photos, and with Assistant built into the software I can easily conjure up the power of Google as I'm walking to my next meeting.\nSee at Google Store\nThe other phone: Samsung Galaxy S7 edge\nBefore the Pixel arrived, the Galaxy S7 edge was my smartphone of choice. It boasts a 12-megapixel camera with impressive low-light performance, enduring battery life, and water resistance. Granted, there isn't much water in Las Vegas, but I like knowing this fancy little phone can go into the water with me if I need it to.\nThis is the phone I'll be using to make social content on the CES show floor, so anything you see at Android Central's social accounts will be recorded with the S7 edge's camera hardware.\nSee at Amazon\nThe makeup bag\nYes, I carry a makeup bag with me when I'm on the job. My little Sephora freebie bag typically carries some blush, a little concealer, and a lipstick to keep my face fresh throughout the day. But I also carry bandages, hand sanitizer, hair ties, and anything else that a pal or colleague might need while we're out on the show floor.\nIf you need something, come find me. I probably have it.\nAlso inside: Bite Beauty Agave Lip Mask\nPeople, this stuff is amazing. I wear it all day and all night and it keeps my lips moisturized through even the harshest weather. Dudes can wear this, too, if they buy it in the plain version. It's the kind of lip moisturizer that won't add sheen either, so you don't have to worry about sporting glossy lips.\nSee at Sephora\nThe in-room amenity: Humidifier\nMy Californian constitution is weak. This giant humidifier is typically my go-to when I've got a cold, but I make room for it in my suitcase so that I'm not waking up in pain during the week of CES. I have a smaller one that I'll typically travel with on other trips, but I bring this gigantic one with me anytime I'm going to Vegas.\nSee at Amazon"}

All five of the Houston teams he has led have reached the playoffs, and one advanced to the Western Conference finals.\nBut he\u2019s an indifferent defender and sometimes runs too nonchalantly.\nThat\u2019s where Chris Paul comes in. Paul brings plenty of intensity and leadership to Rockets \u2013 just too late for Kevin McHale, whom Houston fired as coach in 2015.\nMcHale speaking to Charles Barkley on NBATV, as transcribed by Rahul Lal of HoopsHype:\nJames is not a leader. He tried being a leader last year and doing that stuff, I think Chris Paul is going to help him do that stuff and get back to just hoop and play. On every team you need to have a voice, you have to have somebody that when he says something, everybody listens. Look, if James tells you \u2018Chuck, you\u2019ve got to play better [defense]!\u2019 Are you going to listen to him? You\u2019re kidding me! I lived through it, everybody in the locker room [shook their head].\nI just think that Chris Paul will be good for James Harden. It will allow him to be what he is which is a phenomenal basketball player \u2013 not trying to lead a team, that\u2019s just not his personality.\nHarden reportedly pushed for the Rockets to fire McHale. Harden also contributed to a flawed environment for which McHale took the blame.\nSo, it\u2019s understandable that McHale would call out Harden publicly like this.\nThe former coach is right to a degree (though probably goes a little too far). By resting on defense, even if it\u2019s understandable given his massive offensive load, Harden undercut his leadership ability. That was compounded by Harden seemingly not realizing it and sometimes acting as if his voice still carried maximum weight in the locker room. That could not have been easy for McHale to work around.\nIt won\u2019t necessarily be seamless for Paul, either. Ideally, a team\u2019s best leader is its best player. That won\u2019t be the case in Houston. Will Harden cede control to Paul? Even if he does, will Paul\u2019s new teammates immediately rally behind him?\nThe dynamic has changed, but Harden\u2019s personality still invites awkwardness in the Rockets\u2019 power structure. As much as everyone is watching how the guards mesh on the court, attention should be paid to this aspect, too."}

Leaders of that constituency were exultant.\n\"President Trump is demonstrating his commitment to undoing the anti-faith policies of the previous administration and restoring true religious freedom,\" said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council.\nLiberal advocacy groups, including those supporting LGBT and reproductive rights, were outraged.\n\"The Trump administration is saying to employers, 'If you want to discriminate, we have your back,'\" said Fatima Goss Graves, president of National Women's Law Center.\n___\nStymied police seek help in uncovering Vegas gunman's motive\nLAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 After five days of scouring the life of Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock and chasing 1,000 leads, investigators confessed Friday they still don't know what drove him to mass murder, and they announced plans to put up billboards appealing for the public's help.\nIn their effort to find any hint of his motive, investigators were looking into whether he was with a prostitute days before the shooting, scrutinizing cruises he took and trying to make sense of a cryptic note with numbers jotted on it found in his hotel room, a federal official said.\nSo far, examinations of Paddock's politics, finances, any possible radicalization and his social behaviour \u2014 typical investigative avenues that have helped uncover the motive in past shootings \u2014 have turned up little.\n\"We still do not have a clear motive or reason why,\" Clark County Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said. \"We have looked at literally everything.\"\nThe FBI announced that billboards would go up around the city asking anyone with information to phone 800-CALL-FBI.\n___\nUS states declare emergency ahead of Tropical Storm Nate\nMEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 Tropical Storm Nate gained force as it sped past Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula late Friday after drenching Central America in rain that was blamed for at least 21 deaths. Forecasters said it was likely to reach the U.S. Gulf Coast as a hurricane over the weekend.\nLouisiana and Mississippi officials declared states of state of emergency and Louisiana ordered some people to evacuate coastal areas and barrier islands ahead of its expected landfall Saturday night or early Sunday. Evacuations began at some offshore oil platforms in the Gulf.\nMississippi's government said it would open 11 evacuation shelters in areas away from the immediate coast, with buses available for people who can't drive.\nThe U.S. National Hurricane Center warned that Nate could raise sea levels by 4 to 7 feet (1.2 to 2.1 metres ) from Morgan City, Louisiana, to the Alabama-Florida border. It had already had caused deadly flooding in much of Central America.\nThe centre added metropolitan New Orleans and Lake Pontchartrain to its latest hurricane warning.\n___\nWeinstein on 'indefinite leave' during harassment inquiry\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Movie mogul Harvey Weinstein is on indefinite leave from the company he co-founded while an internal investigation into numerous sexual harassment allegations against him is completed, The Weinstein Co.'s board of directors announced Friday.\n\"We strongly endorse Harvey Weinstein's already announced decision to take an indefinite leave of absence from the Company, commencing today,\" the board said in a statement. \"As Harvey has said, it is important for him to get the professional help for the problems he has acknowledged. Next steps will depend on Harvey's therapeutic process, the outcome of the board's independent investigation and Harvey's own personal decisions.\"\nThe announcement came a day after The New York Times reported that the co-chairman of the Weinstein Co. has over the years reached at least eight legal settlements with women over alleged harassment.\nAttorney John Kiernan of the firm Debevoise & Plimpton LLP was named the head of the investigation. The Weinstein Co. board did not give a time frame for when the investigation would be completed.\n\"We believe it is important to learn the full truth regarding the article's very serious accusations, in the interests of the Company, its shareholders and its employees,\" the company said. The statement was signed by four board members: co-chairman Bob Weinstein, who is Harvey Weinstein's brother, Tarak Ben Ammar, Lance Maerov and Richard Koenigsberg.\n___\nExtra special: Indians edge Yankees 9-8 in 13, take 2-0 lead\nCLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 They've won this season in almost every way imaginable: comebacks, walk-offs, blowouts, nail-biters.\nNo. 104 for the Cleveland Indians topped them all.\nYan Gomes singled home Austin Jackson from second base with none out in the 13th inning as Cleveland rallied from five runs down to stun the New York Yankees 9-8 on Friday and snatch a 2-0 lead in the AL Division Series.\nDespite an atrocious start by ace Corey Kluber, losing slugger Edwin Encarnacion with a severely sprained ankle in the first and facing the possibility of playing their final game at home, the Indians, with some help from a call that went their way, continued a charmed season growing more and more special by the day.\n\"The tendency of this team is to never give up,\" Kluber said. \"Even when we were down 8-3, we didn't believe the game was over. We never feel like we're out of a game.\"\n___\nAP-NORC Poll: Just 24 per cent say US heading right direction\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Just 24 per cent of Americans believe the country is heading in the right direction after a tumultuous stretch for President Donald Trump that included the threat of war with North Korea, stormy complaints about hurricane relief and Trump's equivocating about white supremacists. That's a 10-point drop since June, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\nThe decline in optimism about the nation's trajectory is particularly pronounced among Republicans. In June, 60 per cent of Republicans said the country was headed in the right direction; now it's just 44 per cent .\nThe broader picture for the president is grim, too. Nearly 70 per cent of Americans say Trump isn't level-headed, and majorities say he's not honest or a strong leader. More than 60 per cent disapprove of how he is handling race relations, foreign policy and immigration, among other issues.\nOverall, 67 per cent of Americans disapprove of the job Trump is doing in office, including about one-third of Republicans.\nTracy Huelsman, a 40-year-old from Louisville, Kentucky, is among them. A self-described moderate Republican, Huelsman said she's particularly concerned about the \"divisiveness\" she feels the president promotes on social media.\n___\nAnalysis: Nobel says to Korea nuke players: We are watching\nBANGKOK (AP) \u2014 They couldn't award it to Kim Jong Un or Donald Trump. That much was certain.\nBut the granting of the Nobel Peace Prize to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons opened itself to a clear interpretation across Asia: When it comes to the nuclear-saturated war of words on the Korean Peninsula, attention must be paid and treaties must be signed. And it must be done in a preventative way, at top speed, before something happens that can't be undone.\nLooming in the background of the award announcement Friday was the sometimes scalding, sometimes tepid, never silent geopolitical scuffle this year between the young leader of the third-generation Pyongyang regime and the always voluble president of the United States.\nEven the Nobel committee's language keyed in on that. It sounded like a plaintive cry to push parties to the negotiating table \u2014 to fix something that's already cracked before it's completely, irreversibly shattered.\nThe head of the group listed an assortment of the world's nuclear nations when she spoke after the win. But it was easy to find significance in the two she mentioned before all others \u2014 North Korea and the United States.\n___\nIn Pacific, rising tensions evoke troubling nuclear legacy\nWELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) \u2014 As a young boy growing up on Bikini Atoll, Alson Kelen spent idyllic days playing on the beach and fishing.\nHis grandfather built canoes and his father tended the land. With fewer than 150 people on the remote Pacific island it was a close community, he says, with few signs of the former U.S. nuclear testing program other than the concrete bunkers he was told to avoid and the sunken ships in the lagoon.\nBut in 1978, when Kelen was 10, officials evacuated everybody.

{"id":"187e664c-fcbf-49b2-b42c-826ce6a282ee","text":"EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. -- The Minnesota Vikings haven't had a player with 1,000 yards receiving since Brett Favre's sensational season in 2009.\nStefon Diggs and Adam Thielen are on track this year to give them two.\nA deep track.\nMore Vikings coverage\nMaking difficult catches in tight sideline coverage or breaking open underneath the secondary, Diggs and Thielen have emerged as one of the NFL's best wide receiver tandems. Diggs leads the league with 391 yards and Thielen is third with 358 yards, sandwiching Pittsburgh's three-time All-Pro Antonio Brown .\n\"If both of those guys are singled there's a good chance I'm probably going to throw it their way,\" quarterback Sam Bradford said, \"just because I do feel very confident they're going to go out and get it.\"\nThe Vikings have completed nine passes of 30-plus yards in four games, a pace that would double last season's total of 18. They had 53 successful throws that covered at least 20 yards last year, and they're already at 21 through the first quarter of the 2017 schedule.\nWith an offensive line contributing vastly improved pass protection and a productive running game forcing defenses to honor play-action fakes, the Vikings have so far displayed a dynamic, creative, versatile attack under offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur in his first full season at the play-calling helm.\n\"When we have an opportunity, we've got to make the most of them,\" Thielen said. \"Because we don't know when we're going to have those shots and when they're going to come up.\"\nBradford, who has missed the last three games because of a left knee injury, set the NFL record for completion percentage last year out of necessity behind a struggling offensive line. The running attack was nonexistent, too. Going deep was hardly possible, even if Diggs and Thielen had the ability to turn such play calls into momentum-changing completions.\n\"Pat's just drawing it up, what he sees and what he likes. He's letting Adam do some great things. Adam's got some great hands. He runs some great routes,\" Diggs said. \"So I just feel like it happened organically.\"\nDon't get too comfortable, Cris Carter and Randy Moss. Diggs and Thielen have begun to push their way toward the top of some of the lists of the franchise's all-time leaders.\nSidney Rice was the last 1,000-yard receiver in purple, in 2009. Before that, Moss in 2003 completed a streak of 11 straight seasons with at least one. Seven of those featured two: Carter and Jake Reed each year from 1994-97, and Carter and Moss from 1998-2000.\nThe primary difference with Diggs and Thielen -- both a bit undersized by NFL standards -- is that they had to work harder to reach this status. Diggs was a fifth-round draft pick out of Maryland in 2015 and a healthy scratch the first three games of his career. Thielen famously signed out of an undrafted tryout camp in 2013, spent a season on the practice squad and another couple of years primarily on special teams until his breakout in 2016.\nBut they're both exceptional route runners, with an ability to line up inside or outside and make a shallow cross or a deep post work whenever the situation calls for it. With Brown as an example, the league has seen more and more versatile wide receivers who can confuse and confound defenses by moving all over the formation rather than being limited to either the outside or the slot.\n\"When a quarterback is in trouble, they'll come down with the ball,\" said wide receiver Michael Floyd, who's coming off a four-game suspension and set to join the Vikings as another dangerous down-field option when they play at Chicago on Monday. \"That's expected in our room.\"\nDiggs broke out ahead of Thielen, but he said he's looked up to his teammate as an example of precise route-runner. Shurmur likened Thielen to an outfielder in baseball for his ability to judge the ball and adjust to it in flight for a catch even if he hasn't separated himself from the defender. Both Diggs and Thielen have a keen sense for how to bend a route away from a cornerback to make an interception impossible and a difficult reception look routine. Diggs in particular has a reputation among the Vikings defense for being relentlessly competitive.\n\"He won't ever stop. He catches a ball in practice, he'll run all the way to the end zone,\" cornerback Xavier Rhodes said.\nThe key for the Vikings will now be to keep up this deep passing game with the loss of running back Dalvin Cook , whose early success was setting up those play-action fakes.\n\"But also, it's part of what they do now,\" Detroit coach Jim Caldwell said last week, before his team beat the Vikings 14-7. \"Before they had been getting the ball out fairly quickly, intermediate passes and those kinds of things, and occasionally down the field. Well now they're attacking down the field with that real strong running game, so that's what's made the difference. Those guys are running really good routes, catching the ball well.\""}

However, it still has fans around the world\nHowever much affection you feel for Weetabix, a product that, for me, will for ever be associated with the rough scrape of the loving maternal handkerchief, it\u2019s not hard to understand why it has failed to win over those with no such fond childhood memories. The cereal\u2019s Chinese owner, Bright Foods \u2013 which bought the brand in 2012 believing that the world\u2019s most populous country was on the brink of a Damascene conversion in the breakfast department \u2013 has sold it to US giant Post Holdings after failing to win over consumers. Frankly, it\u2019s little wonder \u2013 if I could walk out of my front door and find stalls selling fluffy barbecue pork buns, spicy hand-pulled noodles or crispy spring onion pancakes, I wouldn\u2019t much fancy an unseasoned lump of compressed grass either.\nPerhaps if Chinese customers had benefited from the recent serving suggestion on British packaging, encouraging consumers to put a Midlands spin on US favourite eggs benedict \u201cby switching a muffin for our nutritious Weetabix\u201d, things might have been different. Although, as one of the few people to have tried a desiccated wheat biscuit topped with ham, poached eggs and hollandaise sauce, I doubt it.\nWeetabix with ham and eggs: \u2018I nearly choked\u2019 Read more\nSomewhat surprisingly, for a product without much discernible flavour, Weetabix is sold in more than 80 countries around the world, although the UK accounts for 70% of sales. The company has joint ventures in South Africa and Kenya (where it boasts the distinction of being \u201ceast Africa\u2019s leading breakfast cereal\u201d), and a manufacturing plant in Ontario to supply the North American market. Although some US consumers, reared on the obvious charms of Froot Loops and Cap\u2019n Crunch, express puzzlement at this \u201centirely unappealing\u201d mush from across the pond, others laud the biscuits as a vehicle for maple syrup or peanut butter and jelly, while in Australia (where Weetabix was invented nearly a century ago), they\u2019re given a local flavour with the addition of Vegemite.\nNo wonder the UK \u2013 which still appreciates the attractions of a gloriously bland, comfortingly soggy serving of utterly unchallenging mush \u2013 remains its biggest market. A nation requires a certain sort of mild-mannered temperament to start the day on a dish so inoffensive in both texture and flavour that it\u2019s classic weaning fodder, and, frankly, not everyone has it.\nWhich is not to say that Weetabix has nothing going for it beyond being suitable fare for the toothless at either end of the age scale. In comparison with many upstarts in the cereal aisle, it\u2019s low in sugar, high in fibre and has a refreshingly short list of ingredients, at the top of which is British wheat \u2013 grown, in fact, within 50 miles of its Northamptonshire mill. So, although it may not be able to compete in a market where breakfast tastes run more to the hot and savoury than the cold and \u2026 well, let\u2019s say neutral, its failure to break China is unlikely to make us love it any less. Just hold the hollandaise."}

A private company, Central Park Development Group, is set to build a six-story office building facing the park, but the DDA is making no contribution toward that development.\nThe city will do two bond issues to finance the project -- a $40 million bond for the new city buildings and an $18 million bond to fund the parking deck, said City Manager Don Johnson.\nThe DDA\u0092s contributions to the project will essentially cover the cost of developing the downtown park, roughly $5 million, and all the underground plumbing, gas and electrical lines to the new city buildings, Johnson said.\nAdvertisement\n\u0093The DDA will contribute $737,000 annually for a term not to exceed 20 years\u0094 toward the city\u0092s $40 million bond, he said.\nThe downtown authority is also agreeing to partially guarantee the revenue bonds for the new parking deck. The DDA would split the cost with the city of paying the debt service on the $18 million bond if for some reason the city auto parking fund failed to generate enough money to pay those costs, Johnson said.\n\u0093This is a very significant contribution by the DDA,\u0094 he said.\nIn return, the city will not charge the DDA $1 million it was supposed to pay for a city parking lot between 11 Mile and Second Street just west of Main Street. The DDA used the parking lot in a deal with Etkin Acquisitions LLC, of Southfield. The company is completing construction of a 75,000-square-foot office building at the site that has parking on the first level and four stories of offices above it.\nRoyal Oak is also forgiving a more than $200,000 debt service fee the DDA had on the cost of building the parking deck on South Lafayette.\n\u0093I think it\u0092s a fantastic deal for the city and it should be a good deal for the DDA,\u0094 Johnson said.\nThe deal between the city and the DDA goes before the City Commission for approval Feb. 12.\nThe DDA previously pushed for the city to increase the size of the future $18 million parking deck from under 500 spaces to 581.\nNew office buildings in the downtown bring more revenue to the DDA in the form of what are called TIF taxes. The DDA captures any increases in tax assessments on businesses in the downtown district. The district\u0092s taxes from the Central Park Development Group\u0092s office building will go toward the bond payments the DDA makes on the upcoming downtown park and related costs.\nBut new office buildings are attractive for another reason as well, said Jay Dunstan, chairman of the DDA.\n\u0093All these new office workers are going to be downtown during the day\u0094 patronizing existing restaurants and retailers, he said. \u0093The number one complaint we hear from businesses is about how we bring in more foot traffic. I think there is going to be a substantial increase in foot traffic.\u0094\nThe downtown has seen increasing interest from developers in the past few years that want to build office space. The Etkin building, which is not quite finished, is already fully leased out, Dunstan said.\n\u0093I expect there will be more demand for residential units in and outside the downtown,\u0094 he said. \u0093People in the Etkin building are going to be buying houses and condos and going to businesses here.\u0094\nA Hyatt hotel, along with a mixed-use building with residential units is expected to be finished later this year on Main Street north of 11 Mile Road.

{"id":"f21b51bc-e670-4b91-81f7-5af403b393f5","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) - Expanding charter schools around the country is losing support among Americans, even as President Donald Trump and his administration continue to push for school choice, according to a survey released Tuesday.\nTrump campaigned on a promise to dramatically improve school choice - charter schools and private school voucher programs - and his Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has made it a priority. But so far the message does not appear to have hit home with the public.\nAbout 39 percent of respondents favor opening more charters - schools that are funded by public money, but usually operated independently of school districts - according to the survey by Education Next, a journal published by Harvard's Kennedy School and Stanford University. That's down from 51 percent last year.\nFILE - In this Feb. 25, 2016, file photo, children hold signs during a rally in support of public charter schools at the Capitol in Olympia, Wash. Support for charter schools has fallen significantly over the past year, according to a national opinion poll. Only 39 percent of respondents say they support the formation of charter schools, compared to 51 percent last year. The study was released by Education Next, an education journal published by Harvard's Kennedy School and Stanford University. (AP Photo\/Ted S. Warren, File)\nSupporters of charter schools had feared that Trump's polarizing rhetoric could hurt the school-choice movement.\nBut the authors of the report say the decline in support for charters can't be linked directly to Trump. They say support for charters slipped almost equally across party lines: by 11 percent among Democrats and by 13 percent among Republicans.\nThey also emphasize that private school vouchers and voucher-type programs, championed by Trump, have seen stable support and declining opposition. Finally, when respondents were told that Trump was advocating for charter schools, overall support increased by 6 percentage points.\n\"We can't say definitively what is responsible for the decline,\" said Martin West, associate professor of education at Harvard University and a co-author of the report. West speculated that the drop may have been caused by continued opposition from teachers unions and many Democrats plus debates over charters' effectiveness.\n\"These developments may have led to a souring of the charter brand,\" West said.\nMeanwhile, opposition to publicly funded vouchers that help parents pay private school tuition dropped from 44 percent last year to 37 percent; 45 percent of respondents currently favor the idea. When it comes to tax credit-funded scholarships, resistance fell from 29 percent to 24 percent, while support was at 54 percent now.\nProponents of charter schools are not discouraged. Nina Rees, president of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, says the drop in popularity was due to \"expensive, sustained, and coordinated campaigns to discredit charter schools, led by teachers' unions and special interests that feel threatened by families having a choice in public school.\"\nRees said that more than 300 public charter schools opened last year, with a total over 6,900 charter schools serving over 3 million students across the country.\n\"The opinions about charter schools that matter most are the opinions of parents and students who have chosen charter schools,\" Rees said.\nTo others, the Trump effect is more apparent. On the campaign trail, Trump spoke of funding a $20 billion school choice program and has proposed major cuts to long-standing K-12 programs, such as teacher preparation and after-school classes, while requesting more funding for charters and vouchers. DeVos has faced criticism from the left for promoting solely school choice and paying little attention to public schools.\nRobin Lake, director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education, a non-partisan research and policy organization, said the Trump administration's rhetoric has only deepened partisan tensions around charter schools.\n\"I would be shocked if it were unaffected,\" Lake said. \"I am just hearing a lot from folks on the ground that schools have a lot of conversations with parents that they didn't use to have about why charter schools are public and why they are not a partisan issue.\"\n\"I am not sure it's not the only reason, but I am pretty sure it's a contributing factor.\"\nRick Hess, director of education policy at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said Trump and DeVos may have turned school choice into a much more federal and divisive issue than it needed to be by talking about it in black-and-white terms and by being too critical of public schools.\n\"Sometimes the way these things get talked about, you can wind up alienating people who might be with you,\" Hess said.\nAn April poll conducted by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, found greater levels of support for charter schools. Forty-seven percent said they favor opening more public charter schools, 23 percent were opposed, and 30 percent felt neutral about it. Meanwhile, 43 percent of respondents supported giving low-income families tuition vouchers for private schools, 35 percent were opposed and 21 percent didn't have a strong opinion either way.

Wight, 26, with forcible touching and endangering the welfare of a child, both class A misdemeanors.\nInvestigators reported that they were contacted Saturday of a possible sexual abuse case in connection to Wight. During his time teaching at Dansville Central School District in Livingston County, investigators accuse him of contacting a 16-year-old through Snapchat over an unspecified time period. While teaching at Arkport Central School, investigators said Wight had forcibly touched the victim off school property.\nWight was arraigned in the town of Friendship and remanded to the Allegany County Jail in lieu of $15,000 bail or $30,000 bond.\nWight also taught at Cuba-Rushford and Fillmore Central Schools in the past, investigators reported, and they believe there are more victims.\nAccording to records obtained from the state by The Empire Center, an Albany-based think tank, Wight was employed part-time with Cuba-Rushford in 2014, 2015 and 2016; Fillmore in 2015; and worked for a short period at Scio and Bolivar-Richburg in 2015.\nAnyone with information is urged to call (585) 344-6200.\nAccording to a release from Arkport Superintendent Jesse Harper, Wight was working as a long-term substitute in the junior-senior high school, a post he held since January.

Ltd, in which Congress president Rahul Gandhi and his mother Sonia Gandhi are major stakeholders, to deposit Rs10 crore in the Rs249.15 crore income tax proceedings against it.\nA bench of justices comprising S. Ravindra Bhat and A.K. Chawla directed the company\u2014earlier summoned along with Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi as an accused by a trial court in the National Herald misappropriation of assets case\u2014to deposit half the amount with the income tax (I-T) department before 31 March and the remaining by 15 April.\nThe high court said subject to deposit of the amount, the tax authorities shall not enforce the demand of Rs249.15 crore made on the company for the assessment year 2011-12. The high court also sought the I-T department\u2019s response on Young Indian\u2019s (YI) plea challenging the demand and the proceedings emanating from it and listed the matter for further hearing on 24 April.\nYI, which was incorporated in November 2010 with a capital of Rs50 lakh, had acquired almost all the shareholding of Associated Journal Ltd (AJL), the owner of the National Herald newspaper. Senior advocate Arvind Datar, appearing for YI, told the court that it will have extreme difficulty in raising Rs10 crore and sought that the amount be fixed at Rs7.5 crore. He said the amount was being collected from contributions by individuals, and it would, therefore, be tough to get more money.\nHe also urged the bench to allow the company to deposit the amount in court, saying it was extremely difficult to get a refund from the I-T department. Advocate Ashish Jain, representing the I-T department, opposed the oral pleas made on YI\u2019s behalf and said the company had to actually deposit Rs49 crore, 20% of the demand, for its appeal to be heard.\nThe bench refused to grant both the pleas made orally on behalf of YI and directed it to deposit Rs10 crore with the I-T department. The amount was required to be deposited if YI\u2019s appeal against the demand was to be heard by the I-T authorities. The high court also directed the tax authorities to expeditiously hear YI\u2019s appeal against the assessment order. YI has approached the high court seeking a direction to stay the recovery of the demand of tax and interest of Rs249.15 crore, raised following a notice of 27 December, 2017 issued under section 156 of the I-T Act for the assessment year 2011-12. It has also challenged the order of the I-T authorities rejecting the firm\u2019s application and sought a stay on the direction to pay Rs49.83 crore, that is 20% of the total disputed outstanding demand.\nA 2017 office memorandum of the central board of direct taxes (CBDT) prescribes a deposit of 20% of the disputed income tax demand by taxpayers for obtaining a stay pending disposal of the matter by the Commissioner of I-T (Appeals).\nEarlier, the aggrieved taxpayer had to deposit only 15% of the disputed I-T demand before approaching the CIT (Appeals). BJP MP Subramanian Swamy, in a private criminal complaint filed before a trial court, had accused the Gandhis and others of conspiring to cheat and misappropriate funds by paying just Rs50 lakh, through which the YI had obtained the right to recover Rs90.25 crore which the AJL owed to the Congress party.\nYI, in its plea, has claimed that it was a charitable company and does not have any income and the income tax authorities have wrongly raised a demand of Rs249 crore for the assessment year of 2011-12. It has contended that the tax demand was \u201cpatently untenable\u201d and the I-T officer had over-assessed the properties of the firm.\nOn 26 June, 2014, the trial court had summoned the Gandhis and others as accused persons as well as Young Indian. The Gandhis and the other accused\u2014Motilal Vora, Oscar Fernandes, Suman Dubey and Sam Pitroda\u2014had denied the allegations levelled against them. On 7 December, 2015, the high court rejected their pleas for quashing the summons issued against them by the trial court in the case.\nOn 19 December, 2015, the trial court had granted bail to Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Vora, Fernandes and Dubey, who had appeared before it pursuant to summons. Pitroda was granted bail on 20 February, 2016, when he had appeared in the court.\nThe Gandhis, AICC (All India Congress Committee) treasurer Vora, AICC general secretary Fernandes, Dubey and Pitroda were summoned for the alleged offences of dishonest misappropriation of property, criminal breach of trust and cheating read with criminal conspiracy of the IPC. The I-T department\u2019s move to issue the notices followed its probe on Swamy\u2019s complaint alleging that the Gandhis had misappropriated AJL\u2019s assets while transferring their shares to the newly formed Young Indian.\nAccording to I-T records, 83.3% of Young Indian was held by Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, 15.5% by Vohra and the remaining 1.2% by Fernandes."}

{"id":"dafeb5ad-c62e-4ca7-b3cb-2e0221d4782c","text":"If you're an avid smartphone user, you've probably heard of reports that said it's listening to your conversation. According to a new research, it was merely a piece of fiction.\nA team of computer science academics at Northeastern University in Boston specially dedicated a year of investigation into the matter and found out smartphones had no ears to listen. Instead, the team discovered a more alarming activity: smartphones can record your device screen without you knowing and send the data to third parties.\nResearchers Elleen Pan, Jingjing Ren, Martina Lindorfer, Christo Wilson, and David Choffnes tested 17,260 popular apps on Android last year, in hopes to find out if smartphone mics can be triggered to listen to chitchats. These include the Facebook app and more than 8,000 apps that deliver information to the social network.\nOf all the apps, more than 9,000 were found to have access to camera and mic. However, not even a single evidence can prove at least one app to have any sort of stimulus to activate the mic of a mobile device so it could listen and record conversations. The researchers believe their study is not foolproof and could still be debunked if researchers can prove so in the future.\n\"We didn't see any evidence that people's conversations are being recorded secretly,\" Choffnes said.\nIn the past few years, conspiracy theories accused apps like Facebook are eavesdropping on phone users' real-life conversations to optimize ad targeting.\nAmong other tested apps, food delivery GoPuff in the United States was found recording the screens of its users during interaction with the app, and data were sent to mobile analytics firm Appsee. However, this is not a surprising fact for Appsee as it peddled itself as capable of capturing device screens. What's interesting is that this particular activity was not disclosed by GoPuff in its privacy policy.\nAccording to the researchers, GoPuff added a similar disclosure only after they were contacted to comment about it. Appsee, on the other, said they were clear in their terms of use that third-party technology should be disclosed by their customers, in this case, GoPuff.\nDespite that, Google said Appsee had to share the blame as the Play Store policy clearly stated that developers have to be clear how user data will be used.\n\"After reviewing the researchers' findings, we determined that a part of AppSee's services may put some developers at risk of violating Play policy. We're working closely with them to help ensure developers appropriately communicate the SDK's functionality with their apps' end-users,\" a Google representative told Gizmodo.\nAt the bottom of it all, unauthorized screen recording activities of companies like Appsee still violates the privacy of users and greatly poses risks to breaches. After all, the company can screen record pretty much anything at any time."}

Which means, if you want them to engage in technology, you should try enjoying it along with them.\nFacebook\u2019s recently announced Messenger Kids, a chat app aimed at users between the ages of 6 and 13, seems like another garbage fire ready to erupt. The app has no ads, and it is tied to the account of a parent, who has to approve their kid\u2019s chat buddies. Still, it\u2019s already raising plenty of alarm for trying to hook children onto Facebook and phones at a formative age. So far, thankfully, it\u2019s only available in the U.S.\nThe streaming video giant has taken action and suspended channels, deleted videos and reprimanded creators in order to convince people it is a safe place to park your kids. This week the company announced it is hiring 10,000 moderators to combat the problem, which we would call a good start. We\u2019ll have to see it in action to see if it makes any real difference.\nWith recent reports of disturbing videos aimed at young kids \u2014 featuring nursery rhymes and characters such as Peppa Pig \u2014 that manage to sneak past content filters on YouTube, it\u2019s once again clear the internet is no place to let children just go play by themselves.\nDespite its flaws, YouTube remains one of the best time sucks ever created. If you want your kids to safely use the site, create a playlist of acceptable videos that you have already vetted for them to see.\nThe good news is, in this holiday season, some of the biggest names in technology are actually putting a focus back on the family. Since I had to grab the iPad with the YouTube Kids app away from my 6-year-old and actually commit to some active parenting, here\u2019s a run-through of some of this season\u2019s hottest technology and how you can share that experience with the family.\nBeyond that, there are plenty of other options. Netflix\u2019s Kids section is quite robust and since the content is all professionally produced, it should be safe from the \u201ctroll farmed\u201d fakes. Another service, Jellies, is a video app that promises only safe, kid-friendly material for $5 a month.\nThe Big N\nIf there is one tech company that could give a lesson on how to be family friendly, it is Nintendo. The company has been resurgent this year, after launching its hybrid home\/portable game console the Switch with a host of hot titles.\nThe biggest knock on the Switch is that it is expensive, starting at $499, adding up to more if you buy accessories, like extra controllers. Beyond that, the library so far has been quite good. For families, there are a number of good games like 1-2 Switch, Snipperclips and MarioKart 8 Deluxe. The recently released Super Mario Odyssey is a masterpiece and even has two-player mode where one player controls Mario and the other plays as his sentient hat, Cappy.\nIf the Switch is too rich for your blood, the SNES Classic also launched this year, with 21 classic games, a $100 price tag and nostalgia to burn.\nCo-pilot mode\nWhile Microsoft has been making a lot of hay about how powerful the latest Xbox is, it\u2019s this neat feature in one of the recent system updates that might help bring gamers and wannabes together. The update allows two controllers that can control the same action onscreen, so a more experienced gamer can help out a novice player.\nFor example, Microsoft has released Super Lucky\u2019s Tale, a fun platforming game featuring a fox jumping through worlds. Playing with my kid, whose hands can barely get around the controller, I can tell her to focus on the left thumb stick, which controls movement, while I can handle the right thumb stick, which in most games controls the camera. The mode is also good to occasionally save her from certain video game death.\nSony gets phone-y\nThe complexity of controllers is absolutely a big barrier for new gamers, young and old, which might explain why Sony has announced a mini-wired gamepad for PS4, available this holiday season, to help bring younger players to the party.\nSony has also introduced a new series of games under the PlayLink banner, which use smartphones as controllers. The games are generally cheaper than hardcore games, require you to download apps onto the phones, and offer more group friendly experiences. There\u2019s SingStar Celebration, a karaoke-type of game. Knowledge is Power is a trivia game with cute characters that represent players. That\u2019s You is a similar question\/answer type game, but the queries are focused on the people in the room. There is also Hidden Agenda, a hide and seek puzzler, and Frantics, a silly minigame collection coming next year. With a group of friends or family, these games can be a blast.\nFor the music maestros\nSmart speakers are going to be one of the hottest holiday gifts, with Google Home speakers going on sale in anticipation of Amazon Alexa\u2019s recent arrival in Canada. Don\u2019t expect amazing results out of either of them \u2014 they are about as good as the assistant on your phone for most queries.\nBut both of these speakers offer some games and activities for kids. Alexa has \u201cskills,\u201d the name for activities it can do, while Google Home has 50 activities and minigames for youngsters, although the majority have yet to make their way to Canada. One that is here is a Mickey Mouse choose-your-adventure type game, where he tells a story and the young listener is expected to respond. It\u2019s fun, although after my daughter played through it once, she started talking incessantly to me again \u2014 so was it really that effective?"}

It's estimated that over 25 million Americans 60 and older are financially insecure, while more than 60% of senior households are burdened by debt.\nContinue Reading Below\nIf you're worried about staying afloat financially in retirement, the solution is simple: Take steps to boost your income. Here are a few solid ways to achieve that goal.\n1. Raise your Social Security benefits\nSocial Security serves as a major source of income for countless retired workers, and though your benefits themselves are calculated based on how much you earned during your career, the age at which you first file for them can cause that number to go up, go down, or stay the same. If you sign up for benefits at what's known as your full retirement age, you'll get the exact monthly benefit you're entitled to based on your earnings.\nFull retirement age is based on year of birth, and here's what it looks like for today's workers and seniors:\nYear of Birth Full Retirement Age 1943-1954 66 1955 66 and 2 months 1956 66 and 4 months 1957 66 and 6 months 1958 66 and 8 months 1959 66 and 10 months 1960 67\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\nThat said, you don't have to file for Social Security exactly at full retirement age. You're actually allowed to start taking benefits as early as age 62, though doing so will cause them to decrease. On the other hand, if you hold off on benefits past full retirement age, you'll get an 8% boost for each year you wait up until age 70, at which point the incentive to delay runs out.\nSo let's assume your full retirement age is 67, at which point you'd collect $1,500 a month. If you were to wait until 70 to file for Social Security, you'd lock in a monthly payment of $1,860 -- for life.\n2. Buy dividend stocks\nThough seniors are often advised to shift their investments into bonds and other such relatively low-risk alternatives, it pays to keep some stocks in your portfolio -- especially those with a strong history of paying dividends. Even if those stock values drop, or the market on a whole underperforms, if you choose the right companies, you'll still get to collect dividends every quarter.\n3. Save in a Roth retirement plan\nThese days, it's common to save for retirement in either an IRA or 401(k), both of which come in the traditional and Roth variety. Now the benefit of the former is that you get an up-front tax break for making contributions, but the downside is that withdrawals from these accounts are taxed in retirement. On the other hand, if you save in a Roth account, you'll lose the immediate tax break, but withdrawals will be yours free and clear of taxes when you're older, thus boosting the amount of income you have access to in retirement.\n4. Monetize a hobby\nMany seniors are advised to work part-time in retirement to generate extra income. But this often means taking a retail position or signing up for a desk job -- the sort of work many seniors aren't thrilled about. That's why if you're looking to boost your income later in life, it pays to explore your options for turning one of your favorite pastimes into a money-making opportunity. This could mean selling the plants you cultivate in your garden at local farmers' markets, or turning your cake-baking hobby into a part-time catering service. The options are virtually limitless.\n5. Become a landlord\nMany seniors choose to downsize in retirement to lower their housing costs and ease the burden of property maintenance. But if you're sitting on a larger home, renting out a portion of it is an easy way to generate a steady influx of cash. Renting out your home is particularly feasible if you have a finished basement or garage that lends to some privacy, and if you live in a college town or large city with ample jobs, your chances of finding a tenant are even greater.\nDon't want someone living in your home full-time? There's also the option to rent out your space seasonally. For example, if you're located near a popular ski resort, you might try renting out a few rooms here and there during school breaks and holiday weekends. Best of all, if you rent out your property for 14 days or less within the same calendar year, you won't have to give up a portion of your rental income to taxes.\nHaving an adequate amount of income is essential for an anxiety-free retirement. If you're worried that your savings won't buy you the lifestyle you're hoping for, it pays to explore your options for boosting your retirement income. And the sooner you start thinking ahead, the better positioned you'll be when you decide to leave the workforce for good.\nThe $16,122 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook\nIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known \"Social Security secrets\" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $16,122 more... each year!

They (Mexico) have an election coming up very soon,\" Trump said at a cabinet meeting briefly attended by reporters.\n\"But we're doing very nicely with NAFTA. I could make a deal really quickly, but I'm not sure that's in the best interests of the United States. But we'll see what happens,\" he said.\nWhile details are not yet clear, a new NAFTA is likely to push the region's auto makers to source more parts from North America in order to create more jobs. Such an outcome could also raise costs for Detroit's main car manufacturers.\nCanadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer and Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo are pressing for a quick deal to avoid clashing with Mexico's July 1 presidential election.\nTo do so, they must reach a compromise on several contentious U.S. demands, including raising the regional automotive content requirements to qualify for tariff-free trade.\nTrump's negotiators had initially demanded North American-built vehicles contain 85 percent content made in NAFTA countries by value, up from 62.5 percent now, and said that half the value must be U.S.-made.\nIndustry officials say the regional demand has been cut to about 75 percent and the U.S. content pitch dropped.\nEntering the USTR's office near the White House, Freeland said the latest talks would focus on the auto sector rules of origin, calling it \"the heart\" of the new NAFTA.\n\"We have been making good progress. This is an issue which is fiendishly complex,\" she told reporters.\nTrump on Monday again fanned uncertainty by threatening to tie a NAFTA deal to Mexico's immigration controls, a suggestion the Mexican government quickly dismissed.\nMexico, which at the outset of the Trump presidency said it would treat the NAFTA revamp as part of a general review of its relations with the United States, has pushed back in the talks by threatening to become less cooperative with Washington.\nTwo weeks ago Mexico vowed to analyse all cooperation with the United States and the government on Tuesday circulated an official's letter to the Mexican Senate saying President Enrique Pena Nieto would soon consider the findings of the review.\nArriving for talks with Lighthizer, Mexico's Guajardo said flexibility will be needed to reach a deal. Guajardo said that Mexico would not accept any U.S. tariffs on aluminium or steel - another measure Trump has threatened to tie to NAFTA. A U.S. exemption to tariffs ends on by May 1.\nNegotiators say a new NAFTA could be possible by early May.\n\"In the coming 10 days we can really have a new agreement in principle,\" said Moises Kalach, head of the international negotiating arm of the CCE business lobby, which represents the Mexican private sector at the talks.\n\"As soon as there is political will from the American government to go for a final deal, I think we can close this,\" Kalach told Mexican radio. \"We've had all our (negotiating) teams in Washington for two weeks and we will continue working all this week, the weekend and into next week.\"\n(Reporting by David Lawder and Jeff Mason; additional reporting by Anthony Esposito, Dave Graham and Veronica Gomez in Mexico City; Editing by James Dalgleish and Grant McCool)\nThis story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed."}

As opposed to point-to-point races, like the now-defunct USA Pro Challenge, all stages for men and women start and end at the same location: stages one, two and four of the men's race are \"circuits\" featuring multiple laps on challenging courses, while both stages of the women's race are also circuits.\n\"Each course will give fans numerous opportunities in a single day to see the sport's top riders,\" said David Koff, CEO of RPM Events Group, the organization formed to put on the race. \"And the start-finish areas are being built to be magnets of activity before, during and after each race. Our goal is to have you come out for one experience and to stick around for many, many more.\"\nThe Colorado Classic is sanctioned by Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) and designated as a 2.HC race, which is the highest category outside of World Tour races. So far, more than 14 men's teams from across the world have committed to the event, including UCI World Teams like BMC Racing. The guys are joined by an eclectic mix of more than a dozen women's teams, such as Alp Cycles Women's Racing Team (Colorado based), Amy D. Foundation Team (Colorado based), Colavita\/Bianchi, Cylance Pro Cycling and Sho-Air Twenty20.\nThe entire race will be televised on NBCSN, with Paul Sherwen calling the action, joined by analyst and former pro Christian Vande Velde and reporter Bob Roll.\nMen's race\nStage one: The opening stage is the longest and covers a total of 93.5 miles (150.4 km) as riders push the pace for six laps on a 15.58-mile (25.1 km) course in the shadow of Pikes Peak, running between downtown Colorado Springs and the sandstone formations of the city's iconic Garden of the Gods.\nStage two: The second day is test of endurance and willpower over 64 miles (103 km) in our own downtown Breckenridge. During 10 laps on the 6.4-mile (10.3 km) course, riders face more than 7,000 feet of climbing at 9,600 vertical feet, including multiple, leg-crushing runs up the notorious Moonstone Road climb \u2014 and the subsequent thrilling descents down Illinois Gulch to Main Street.\nStage three: Day three takes riders on an 81-mile (130 km) out-and-back course that runs from the RiNo race hub to the mountains west of Denver on the Peak to Peak Highway, and then returns to Denver through scenic Golden Gate Canyon State Park. The event ends with a thrilling finishing sprint through the streets of Denver, with speeds approaching 60 miles per hour. Among the day's highlights will be race action on Gap Road in the foothills west of Denver, where riders will face the toughest part of the course: the sole King of the Mountain (KOM) section and dirt roads with steep, rolling hills.\nStage four: The final day again highlights the downtown the start-and-finish area as riders tackle a 7.5-mile (12km) city circuit that stretches from RiNo to City Park and back. Riders will finish 10 laps in the final stage for a total of 74.6 miles (120.1 km).\nWomen's race\nThe two stages of the women's Colorado Classic are planned for the same courses as the men's opening stages.\nStage one: The women's first day covers 38.36 miles (61.7 km) over multiple laps in Colorado Springs, sending a field of the best women cyclists through the Garden of the Gods.\nStage two: The second and final women's stage covers 32 miles (51.5 km) over five laps on the Breckenridge course, with riders conquering Moonstone hill over and over again.\nWilco, Death Cab and more\nWhen the women wrap up and cycling action moves to Denver, the Colorado Classic becomes the anchor the first-ever Velorama Festival \u2014 a three-day bike, music and craft festival in the city's RiNo Art District.\nFrom Aug. 11-13, Velorama features: big-name musical acts, some of the world's best cyclists competing in the final two stages of the Colorado Classic, and hundreds of vendors in a festival marketplace that includes a Bike and Lifestyle Expo, all anchored by independent craft makers of beer, cider and wine in the Drink RiNo group.\nThe Denver start-finish area will be inside the ticketed Velorama Festival grounds, with ticket prices to be announced later this summer. Wilco, Death Cab for Cutie, Old 97's and the Jayhawks headline three days of music for ticketed spectators.\nDon't want to pay for the race? No admission is being charged for the start-finish areas in Colorado Springs and Breckenridge, and cycling fans will find countless areas to cheer on racers for free from alongside the courses in all four stages."}

President Donald Trump is questioning the impartiality of Mueller's investigation and says the probe is groundless, while raising doubts about whether a fired top FBI official kept personal memos outlining his interactions with Trump. (AP Photo\/Andrew Harnik, File)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 More Republicans are telling President Donald Trump in ever blunter terms to lay off his escalating criticism of special counsel Robert Mueller and the Russia probe. But party leaders are taking no action to protect Mueller, embracing a familiar strategy with the president \u2014 simply waiting out the storm.\nTrump blistered Mueller and his investigation all weekend on Twitter and started in again on Monday, questioning the probe\u2019s legitimacy with language no recent president has used for a federal inquiry. \u201cA total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest!\u201d Trump tweeted.\nMueller is leading a criminal probe into whether Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign had ties to Russia and whether there has been obstruction of justice since then.\nTrump was told to cut it out on Sunday by such notable Republicans as Trey Gowdy, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, and Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Then on Monday he was told that firing Mueller would be \u201cthe stupidest thing the president could do\u201d by Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.\nBut Hatch, on CNN, also said he didn\u2019t see any need for legislation to protect Mueller. And that sentiment was widely echoed by GOP leaders.\nIn recent months, bills to protect the special counsel have stalled, and Republican leaders have stuck to muted statements endorsing Mueller or denying he is in trouble. So far, that tactic has worked for them as Trump has lambasted the Russia investigation on Twitter but allowed Mueller to continue his work.\nDemocrats say legislation is needed.\n\u201cImmediately,\u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. And Arizona Republican Jeff Flake, a frequent Trump critic, said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t pick this fight, then we might as well not be here.\u201d\nBut GOP leaders saw no reason to leap to stop a firing they don\u2019t think is in sight.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen so I just think it\u2019s not necessary, and obviously legislation requires a presidential signature,\u201d said Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate. \u201cI don\u2019t see the necessity of picking that fight right now.\u201d\nStill, Cornyn said there would be \u201ca number of unintended consequences\u201d if Mueller were to be removed, and lawmakers had communicated that message to Trump \u201cinformally and formally.\u201d\nWhite House lawyer Ty Cobb issued a statement Sunday tamping down the speculation, saying Trump is not \u201cconsidering or discussing\u201d Mueller\u2019s removal. White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said Trump has \u201csome well-established frustration\u201d about the probe but insisted there is no internal discussion about removing Mueller.\nSeparately, Trump\u2019s legal team has provided documents to Mueller summarizing their views on key matters being investigated, according to a person familiar with the situation. That person insisted on anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation.\nThe records were given as Trump\u2019s lawyers negotiate with Mueller\u2019s team about the scope and terms of a possible interview with the president.\nAlso, Trump added a new lawyer. Joseph diGenova, a former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, will join his team later this week.\nDiGenova has been outspoken in his defense of Trump, talking of a \u201cbrazen plot\u201d to exonerate Hillary Clinton in an email investigation and to \u201cframe\u201d Trump with a \u201cfalsely created crime.\u201d\nMultiple White House officials said Monday that they believe Trump is now acutely aware of the political \u2014 and even legal \u2014 consequences of taking action against Mueller. For now, they predicted, Trump will snipe at Mueller from the outside.\nHis sniping is getting more pointed.\nTrump challenged the probe\u2019s existence over the weekend and strongly suggested political bias on the part of Mueller\u2019s investigators.\nThe tweets ruffled some GOP lawmakers. South Carolina\u2019s Gowdy admonished the president\u2019s lawyers, saying that if Trump is innocent, \u201cact like it.\u201d\nBut House and Senate leaders remained quiet, and decidedly unruffled.\n\u201cAs the speaker has always said, Mr. Mueller and his team should be able to do their job,\u201d said AshLee Strong, spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan.\nA spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell referred to comments that McConnell made in January saying he wasn\u2019t worried that Mueller would be ousted.\nTwo bipartisan Senate bills introduced last summer, when Trump first started criticizing Mueller\u2019s probe, would make it harder to fire a special counsel by requiring a judicial review. But Republicans backing the bills have not been able to agree on the details, and Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley has shown little interest in moving them. McConnell has said he thinks they are unnecessary.\nStill, some of the White House officials acknowledged that Trump did once flirt with removing Mueller.\nThat came last summer, when Trump\u2019s legal team \u2014 then led by New York attorney Marc Kasowitz \u2014 was looking into potential conflicts of interest with Mueller and his team and planning to make a case to have him removed, according to people familiar with the strategy. Those people spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private conversations.\nAs that strategy was being formulated, Trump directed White House counsel Don McGahn in June to call Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to raise the perceived conflicts and push for Mueller\u2019s removal, according to one of the people familiar with the matter.\nMcGahn put off making the call because he disagreed with the strategy, the person said. When Trump persisted in pressing the issue, McGahn told other senior White House officials he would resign if Trump didn\u2019t back off. Trump let the matter drop, the person said.\nTrump cannot directly fire Mueller. Any dismissal, for cause, would have to be carried out by Rosenstein, who appointed the counsel and has continued to express support.\nTrump has fumed to confidants that the Mueller probe is \u201cgoing to choke the life out of\u201d his presidency if allowed to continue indefinitely, according to an outside adviser who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations with the president.\nLikely contributing to Trump\u2019s sense of frustration, The New York Times reported last week that Mueller had subpoenaed the Trump Organization for Russia-related documents. Trump had said Mueller would cross a red line with such a step.\n\u201cWhy does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans?\u201d he tweeted Sunday.\nSome of Mueller\u2019s investigators indeed have contributed to Democratic political candidates including Hillary Clinton, but Justice Department policy and federal service law bar discrimination in the hiring of career positions on the basis of political affiliation. Mueller is a Republican."}

Gambia, like South Africa and Burundi, accused the court of ignoring crimes of non-African nations and took steps to withdraw late last year. Here's more from our previous reporting:\n\"Every person tried by the ICC since the treaty creating it was adopted in 1998 has been African. \"Other war crimes trials have been carried out by ad hoc tribunals created after a specific conflict, such as those created for Yugoslavia and Cambodia, or for the Nuremberg trials conducted after World War II.\"\nCl\u00e9ment Capo-Chichi, Africa regional coordinator with the Coalition for the International Criminal Court, told The Associated Press that the move is a \"crucial victory for victims of grave crimes and the rule of law.\"\nBarrow's road to the presidency was extremely tumultuous. In December's presidential election he defeated Jammeh, the leader of Gambia for 22 years. But then Jammeh refused to step down, eventually resulting in West African military troops crossing Gambia's borders. After Barrow was sworn into office in neighboring Senegal, Jammeh eventually succumbed to massive international pressure and left the country.\nHe fled to Equatorial Guinea \u2013 incidentally, a country that is not a member state of the ICC.\nNow, the new Gambian government is also receiving high-profile diplomatic visits and pledges of international support.\nU.K. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson paid Barrow a visit Tuesday, which the BBC describes as \"the first to the Gambia by a British foreign secretary.\" On the agenda: Gambia's request to rejoin the Commonwealth of Nations, an international organization comprised of 52 nations that were once British colonies.\nThe former leader pulled Gambia out of the Commonwealth in 2013, according to a statement from the organization. Now, a Commonwealth spokesperson said it welcomed the move: \"We looked forward to the country's eventual return because it was part of our very close knit family and our doors have always remained open.\"\nThe European Union has also declared a \"new chapter of relations with The Gambia.\" It froze assistance nearly three years ago, according to the BBC. But last week, EU Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development Neven Mimica traveled to Gambia and announced a $79 million package of immediate support.\nJammeh had a dismal human rights record. Barrow appears to be taking steps to change that pattern. As Reuters reported, \"police opened their first investigation on Monday into unresolved deaths and disappearances under Jammeh.\"\nIn a recent press conference, Barrow also stated that he intends to convene a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to address human rights violations of his predecessor.\nHe was also candid about the scope of obstacles he faces: \"There was a government here for 22 years. 22 years is a long time. And we are able to change the government after 22 years, so obviously there will be a lot of challenges. To look at all the system, and make a complete overhaul. I think that is a big challenge to my new government.\""}

Often this is done to better understand how formative experiences such as world events or technological changes shape the ways people see and interact with the world.\nEarlier this month, the Pew Research Center established an official cutoff point for the end of the millennial generation, formally designating millennials as people born between 1981 and 1996.\nIn an explanation of that decision, Pew president Michael Dimock wrote that generations are better viewed as a tool for understanding how perspectives and views change \u2014 not as strict categories that define who people are.\nOlder millennials and younger millennials probably feel differently about a number of topics, but most were between ages 5 and 20 when the 9\/11 terrorist attacks happened. That means that those attacks and their aftermath loomed large as those people have become adults.\nThe economic recession of 2008 \u2014 which came at a time when many millennials were entering the workforce \u2014 played a significant role too. Plus, as Dimock put it, \"Millennials came of age during the internet explosion.\"\nHere's how Pew officially categorizes the generations by birth year at this point in time:\nSamantha Lee\/Business Insider\nThe number of birth years that a generation includes can vary. Millennials span a 16-year range, according to Pew. The Gen X cohort was another 16-year group, but the boomers had a 19-year range and the silent generation an 18-year range.\nPicking a cutoff year is complicated, of course, as groups change over time.\n\"[T]he differences within generations can be just as great as the differences across generations, and the youngest and oldest within a commonly defined cohort may feel more in common with bordering generations than the one to which they are assigned,\" Dimock wrote.\nYet establishing a cutoff point helps researchers investigate how a group has been shaped by similar experiences.\nPew thinks it's too early to define the generation that comes after millennials, but some names that have been tossed around are \"the postmillennial generation\" or Gen Z.\nBy the time people born in 1997 or later became teenagers, the US had largely become a place where it was possible to be constantly connected to the internet, usually with a mobile device (the iPhone launched in 2007). While millennials largely adapted to social media and consistent connection to the internet, people born from the late '90s on probably don't remember a time without those tools.\nBut the kids being born now will likely be considered part of a new generation after Gen Z.\nDimock said it's always possible that new data could give researchers a reason to reevaluate these generational boundaries, though. In the meantime, he said, the group coming of age after millennials would be especially interesting to follow.\n\"We look forward to spending the next few years studying this generation as it enters adulthood,\" Dimock wrote. \"All the while, we'll keep in mind that generations are a lens through which to understand societal change, rather than a label with which to oversimplify differences between groups.\""}

during Qatar's national day celebrations in Doha (AFP photo)\nDOHA \u2014 Since the Qatar diplomatic crisis started, one response by the emirate has become increasingly clear \u2014 Doha is using its extraordinary wealth to fund a massive push in defence spending.\nA flurry of military contracts have followed since Saudi Arabia and its allies dramatically cut all ties with Qatar last June, accusing the 2022 World Cup host of sponsoring terrorism and cosying up to Riyadh's bitter regional rival, Iran.\nIsolated by and increasingly vulnerable to its more powerful neighbours, Qatar has in the past eight months subsequently announced military contracts worth some $25 billion (20 billion euros).\n\"While Qatar's defence spending has been increasing for a number of years, the more recent spending surge appears to be directly related to the crisis,\" says David Roberts, assistant professor at King's College London.\nDoha bought F-15 planes from the United States barely a fortnight after the crisis began and at the same time as US President Donald Trump appeared to take the Saudis' side in the dispute.\nIn December it signed a Rafale fighter jet deal with France during a visit to Qatar by French President Emmanuel Macron.\nThat deal caused consternation among some officials in Britain \u2014 desperate for its own bilateral deal as it negotiates its withdrawal from the European Union \u2014 until days later London too signed an agreement to supply Typhoon jets to the Qatari air force.\nBritain will also supply air security during 2022.\nLast month it was announced that Qatar was in talks to buy Russian air defence missiles.\nSandwiched between the air force deals, Qatar, bordered on three sides by water, also negotiated a multibillion-dollar contract to buy seven Italian navy vessels.\nInvasion fears\nThere has also been military diplomacy.\nIn the past few days Qatar's defence minister, Khalid Bin Mohammed Al Attiyah, has said the emirate also wants to host the US navy.\nIt is already home to the largest US airbase in the Middle East, Al Udeid, which houses some 10,000 American troops.\nAnd Turkey, which also has a military base in Qatar, could also deploy naval forces there.\nSymbolically, during December's National Day celebrations, Qatari troops paraded with recently acquired Chinese short-range ballistic missiles.\n\"It's a massive investment into the military,\" says Andreas Krieg, a military adviser to the Qatari government until last year.\nThis huge leap in spending \u2014 until 2013 Qatar was spending around $3 billion a year on defence, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute \u2014 reflects Doha's fear of invasion especially at the beginning of the crisis.\nQatari officials admit privately they were stunned when the crisis began, taken completely unaware by the Saudi-led states.\nDespite the sometimes bizarre nature of the crisis \u2014 Doha flying in thousands of cows, protest songs and Qatar missing from a map at the Louvre Abu Dhabi \u2014 fears of invasion initially ran very deep.\n\"There was concern that the initial diplomatic and economic measures imposed on Qatar on June 5 might be the prelude for military action,\" says Kristian Ulrichsen, a fellow at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University in the United States.\nKrieg adds that Qatar's fear of invasion stretches back to 2014 when Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain abruptly pulled their ambassadors from Qatar.\nTheir dispute was resolved \u2014 or at least papered over until last summer \u2014 but its impact is not forgotten.\nExpect the unexpected\nQatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani took over from his father Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani just months before that dispute.\nA former member of the Qatari air force who attended Britain's Sandhurst military training academy, Sheikh Tamim broke from his father's policies and poured more of his country's gas riches into defence spending.\n\"The military had been underfunded for many decades,\" says Krieg.\n\"Regardless of the crisis, there was always a demand to get new equipment for the air force, navy and land forces.\"\nRoberts adds: \"I think Qatar's leaders are trying to expect the unexpected.\n\"So while they may feel that a military action is unlikely, their expectations have been consistently wrong thus far, so Qatar needs to plan for the worst.\"\nMilitary contracts also have value beyond mere weaponry \u2014 and for Qatar it's also a way of diplomacy, cementing its relations with key countries.\nLolwa Al Khater, foreign ministry spokeswoman, told AFP that bilateral defence deals help to \"strengthen these partnerships\".\nRoberts adds they \"deeply intertwine\" Qatar's security with Washington, Paris or London.\n\"Qatar wants these states to have an increasingly direct stake in Qatar's security and stability,\" he says.\nBut despite the spending, Qatar's military capabilities pale into comparison to those of Saudi Arabia and the UAE.\nUltimately its long-term security may depend on another investment \u2014 Al Udeid.\n\"We shouldn't underestimate that the greatest guarantor is Al Udeid,\" says Krieg, referring to the presence of US troops at the base on its territory."}
{"id":"134b32c6-a74f-49de-b154-5e35597b532b","text":"1946* stands out in my mind for a couple of reasons. First, it was the year that my father, mother and I moved into the historic Haynes house. My father, along with my grandmother, grandfather and his sister Peggy, had moved into it in 1917. My father was 9 years old at the time, and he lived in that house until he went away to UBC in 1928. My grandparents continued to live in the house until 1946, when they moved to another house in Osoyoos, and my family moved in and operated the orchard.\nThe second reason that 1947 was a significant year is that I entered grade 7, and since the Osoyoos School (now the town office) at that time was an elementary school, it meant being bussed to Oliver. For grades 7, 8 and the first part of 9, we were housed in what was known as the \u201941 building. The first school bus we rode on had wooden seats which ran from the back of the bus to the front. Interesting movement of bodies occurred whenever an unexpected slow down or stop was made by the driver. Grade 7 bodies, being naturally smaller than older student\u2019s bodies, got moved along those bench seats quite frequently. Buses changed: the school changed as well, as in the fall of 1948, we were able to move into the brand new Southern Okanagan High School. I think it was in the early 50\u2019s that the present Sonora Centre was built as the Elementary School, and it eventually expanded to include grade 10, while 11\u2019s and 12\u2019s were bussed to Oliver. The present High School was built in the early 80\u2019s.\nGoing to Oliver to school was really a positive experience. It was a good first step in learning to be independent; we met new people and made new friends. Our age group benefitted from making a small step out into the world. Later, the same benefits were available only to grades 11 and 12, but I feel that is was still a good experience.\nGrowing up in Osoyoos back then was a lot different from the way it is now. Osoyoos back then was a lot different from what it is now. Everybody knew everybody and it was truly a community in every sense of the word. But it allowed us a sense to freedom that kids don\u2019t have these days. It was a growing agricultural area, and the concept of tourists was unknown. It\u2019s a little unfair to make too many comparisons, because WW2 influenced our daily lives, with food rationing, gas rationing, etc. But one memory is worth commenting on: in those days, if you were outside, and a vehicle went by on the gravelled highway, you knew whose it was just from the sounds! Now, as a consequence of the 1948 flood, the bridge was replaced, the roadway raised and paved; the traffic is now endless and we even have the traffic light, and we don\u2019t recognize even the appearance of local traffic.\nWe had lived in a few of the houses that are on the lake on the south side of \u201cmotel strip\u201d until that aforementioned move to the Haynes house in 1946. That house took a few years of planning and building, and was completed in 1882. Looking at it now, it is impossible to tell that its first story is built of logs that were placed on a stone foundation. Any lumber that was used, primarily for the second floor, was floated down the Valley from a sawmill just south of Kelowna. It was a great place for a young boy to grow up in. There was lots of room, as it was just over 1900 square feet. The second floor, really more of an attic, had four rooms and they were used as play rooms and storage rooms. When the house was eventually sold, we were impressed by the sheer volume of interesting items that both my grandparents and parents had put up there. In the years I lived in it, from 1946 until 1959, I was always aware of its history. It was a delight to have 14 acres of orchard to roam in, and the unmown grass grew tall enough to provide settings for all sorts of child-invented games.\nIt was a change from where we had lived previously, since the houses were farther apart. But a newly acquired bicycle made short work of the distance back to the old neighbourhood, as did a small boat with a small inboard gas engine."}

About 20 million people are in the path of these severe storms, and the areas most at risk are parts of Tennessee, northeastern Mississippi, northern Alabama and northwest Georgia, according to CNN meteorologist Haley Brink.\nThe bull's-eye of this storm is northern Alabama, CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward said. In a 4 p.m. press conference, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said the state is \"not taking this situation lightly.\"\n\"My team and I have been monitoring this system throughout the day,\" she said. \"The exact locations of where these storms will form are unpredictable.\"\nThe NWS said that \"a large and extremely dangerous\" tornado had developed near Russellville, Alabama.\nThe area between southern Tennessee and northern Florida has a slight risk of being impacted by this storm.\nThe main impact of this system, Brink said, includes tornadoes, very strong, large hail and damaging winds. It's expected to hit Monday evening and continue overnight. Tuesday will mostly see a wind threat, Ward said.\nAs the weather in the South clears up, the mid-Atlantic and New England will be bracing for the fourth nor'easter to hit the region in less than three weeks.\nTrack the storm here\nForecast models are saying the low pressure system could move toward the coast, which would bring snow to Washington, DC, New York City, Boston, and possibly Portland, Maine, Brink said. Areas of the mid-Atlantic could see some snowfall as early as Monday night, she said, and snow is likely to keep falling Tuesday through Wednesday. Boston could get 2-4 inches of snow and 3-6 inches could fall on Washington, DC, Brink said.\nHowever, the system's exact path is still uncertain and should become clearer in the next 24 hours, Ward said. At this point, Ward said, the question is whether the system will continue east toward the coast or travel north. If it veers north, there will be significant snow in New England, but if it goes eastward, it'll mean less snow for the region.\nNew England is still reeling from last week's storm, which the weather service declared a blizzard. Before that, a storm dropped heavy, wet snow in areas west of Interstate 95 and left one person dead in New York state.\nOn March 2, a nor'easter that morphed into a \"bomb cyclone\" slammed much of the Northeast with heavy snow and rain, hurricane-force wind gusts and significant coastal flooding. The storm left six people dead from falling trees, and about 900,000 customers lost power.\nNor'easters aren't uncommon for New England during this time of year, CNN meteorologist Jenn Varian said. They can occur any time of year, but they're strongest from September to April."}

Backing for the technology platform, which lets security teams gain the insight needed and take the action required to continuously eliminate exposed vulnerabilities in their production systems, comes from YL Ventures with participation from additional prominent cybersecurity and enterprise software investors, including Giora Yaron, Chairman of the Executive Council of Tel Aviv University.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20180530005707\/en\/\nl. to r. Vulcan Cyber Co-founders: Roy Horev, CTO; Yaniv Bar-Dayan, CEO; Tal Morgenstern, Chief Product Officer (Photo: Business Wire)\nOrganizations today are dramatically increasing their pace of change and innovation, adopting Agile Development and DevOps processes while constantly deploying and upgrading new and innovative applications and technologies. This speed of change coupled with the ever-expanding number of vulnerabilities in today\u2019s enterprise software stack and hackers who are constantly probing for this \u201clow hanging fruit,\u201d creates a reality of incessant and unrelenting risk. In fact, recent well-known breaches including Equifax, as well as the WannaCry and Petya attacks, all exploited known vulnerabilities. Vulcan Cyber was founded to eliminate this risk.\nBy 2020, 99% of vulnerabilities exploited will continue to be ones known by security and IT professionals for at least one year, according to Gartner Research. Dwell time, the time frame from discovery to prioritization to fix, is months or more in most organizations. According to a recent Ponemon Institute study, \u201cToday\u2019s State of Vulnerability Response,\u201d the average enterprise \u201cwastes weeks coordinating teams and manual tasks when remediating a vulnerability.\u201d Delays in discovery and analysis, as well as planning and prioritization of remediation, adds months to dwell time. Many of these delays occur as cross-functional teams struggle to manage remediation while also ensuring business continuity.\nThe Vulcan Cyber Continuous Vulnerability Remediation platform eliminates the most critical risks caused by vulnerabilities while at the same time avoiding any unexpected impact to business operations. Vulcan reduces dwell time from weeks and months to hours. Vulcan Cyber\u2019s comprehensive data collection aggregates data from dozens of scanning tools while its advanced exposure analytics deliver unprecedented insight into the true risk of existing vulnerabilities in the deployed enterprise stack. Vulcan then automatically prioritizes, plans, orchestrates and validates remediation. Vulcan is the industry\u2019s first remediation orchestration engine that coordinates the teams, tools and tasks needed to successfully and rapidly eliminate exposure and risk.\n\u201cEnterprises today are experiencing a state of continuous risk exposure,\u201d said Yoav Leitersdorf, managing partner at YL Ventures, who led the Vulcan Cyber funding round. \u201cThis exposure is a board level concern. The speed of change, innovation, volume of constant probes and attacks has simply outpaced the tools and skilled resources IT security teams have. For many teams, it simply feels like they\u2019re in a never-ending storm of crisis and reactive activities.\u201d\nIT security and operations teams today rely on dozens of vulnerability assessment and patch management tools and are using manual processes and custom scripting to tie them together. By automating the collection and integration of all the relevant vulnerability data from these tools across the enterprise IT stack and correlating this information with risk exposure, Vulcan provides insight that enables continuous evaluation of exposure and prioritization of remediation. Vulcan then orchestrates patch management, IT service management tools and the teams and tasks needed to continuously remediate the most critical exposure in production environments. Lastly, Vulcan validates remediation effectiveness and feeds the new data back into the insight engine. Vulcan integrates out of the box with all popular scanning, configuration management and patching tools, as well as provides open APIs to connect new scanners, tools and feeds into the platform.\n\u201cThe team at Vulcan has the right vision to deliver IT security teams unprecedented insight and the ability and confidence needed to successfully eliminate exposure and risk. Vulcan has the potential to be transformative for enterprises, taking them from a state of continuous exposure to continuous protection,\u201d Leitersdorf added.\nAndy Ellis, CSO of Akamai, concurred, \u201cOrganizations today have diverse ecosystems, from on-premise bespoke applications to cloud-deployed services. Keeping track of the state of these applications and systems \u2013 often owned by distinct engineering and operations teams \u2013 in order to ensure that system maintenance keeps up with the never-ending flow of vulnerabilities and exposures is vital. Continuous and integrated visibility into remediation is the first step to remediation orchestration for enterprises.\u201d\n\u201cVulcan\u2019s approach to enable and empower both IT security teams and their operations counterparts is a leap forward, giving us a vision for a world where companies aren\u2019t being breached everyday with exploits against vulnerabilities that have been known about for months or years,\u201d said Ellis.\nYaniv Bar-Dayan, Vulcan Cyber CEO and co-founder explains that vulnerabilities are the \u201cdirty\u201d but critical work of IT security. \u201cIt has become almost impossible for CISOs and their teams to understand and manage the significant and systemic risk of vulnerabilities in their production systems, leaving them in a state of continuous exposure. It might sound more glamorous to talk about zero-day and next generation threats, but vulnerability remediation is truly where the rubber meets the road. The only way to deal with this continuous risk exposure is through continuous remediation, achieved with robust data collection, advanced analytics, automation and closed loop remediation planning, orchestration and validation. This is exactly what we are delivering to IT security teams with Vulcan Cyber.\u201d\nThe Vulcan platform is currently in limited availability to qualified customers. General availability will be in late 2018. For more information, visit VulcanCyber.com.\nAbout Vulcan Cyber\nVulcan Cyber is the industry\u2019s first Continuous Vulnerability Remediation solution.

{"id":"810f45f6-5a2d-4330-a203-b335591cb40e","text":"Department stores were once seen as innovative. They stocked wide ranges of goods \u2013 Noel Coward once bought an alligator from Harrods. It was Harry Gordon Selfridge who coined the phrase \u201cthe customer is always right\u201d. Stores rewarded customer loyalty by providing exclusive credit via store cards. Little by little, all this eroded.\nTo the news that House of Fraser is closing half its stores, we can add a profit warning from John Lewis. Times are tough for retailers, to be sure, with Toys R Us and Maplin going under, and mainstays like Marks & Spencer and Mothercare closing stores. The threat to department stores is perhaps especially troubling, since they act as \u201canchors\u201d for entire high streets and shopping centres.\nDebenhams recently announced job cuts and store closures, while the last BHS disappeared just two years ago. Worse, the trend looks global: those reporting either sales declines and\/or store closures in recent years include Myer in Australia; Karstadt and Kaufhof in Germany; Macy\u2019s and Sears in the US; and Brown Thomas in Ireland. (Some, such as Macy\u2019s and Karstadt, look like turning around.)\nThe challenges are numerous. Bank credit cards let customers shop wherever, while cut-price specialists offer deeper selections at cheaper prices. People shop online with much less effort. Yes, physical stores let you handle goods, but a recent major survey found 64% of customers leaving a store due to poor customer service.\nSo are we talking terminal decline? I am involved in research that strongly suggests otherwise: we may just be seeing a shakeout of weaker offerings. Here are five ways for department stores to ensure an optimistic future:\n1. Offer an experience\nThe whole of retail has shifted from a purely transactional focus towards giving customers experiences. Some department stores do this better than others. Macy\u2019s virtual reality showrooms in New Jersey and Florida, for example, invite customers to work with a \u201cconcierge\u201d to build a 3D replica of their own living room. They then preview furniture and home decor options in virtual reality. Macy\u2019s is rolling this out to 50 stores this summer.\nThe next step is to make experiences transformational \u2013 challenging customers\u2019 preconceptions about themselves and the world around them. In-store art installations and exhibitions have the power to do this. The Selfridges Flipside exhibition in London was all about challenging the meaning of luxury: the store invited seven brands including Louis Vuitton to create installations that pinpointed what true luxury is now.\nLe Bon March\u00e9 in Paris has used its space for art exhibitions featuring contemporary artists like Ai Weiwei, Chiharu Shiota and Leandro Erlich. Erlich, of Argentina, created an installation that made the escalator look like it was tied in knots, for example. Using global artists has the added advantage of raising a store\u2019s profile in the international press.\n2. Build a community\nDepartment stores are more likely to succeed if they build a community around themselves. Major art exhibitions are one option; Liberty London has achieved something similar with a sewing school. Fortnum & Mason of London runs Christmas workshops for things like the perfect New Year\u2019s dinner party and, for children, Christmas cupcake decorating.\nDepartment stores are also building virtual communities, typically around the brand and specific interests. US department store Nordstrom was among the first luxury brands to create its own Reddit username and community. Galeries Lafayette and Selfridges are good at using Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to have dialogues with customers.\n3. Encourage socialising\nThe longer someone stays in a store, the more likely they are to make a purchase. One way of increasing \u201cdwell time\u201d is to encourage socialising in store. Retailers often do this to encourage shopping with friends and family: craft tables for children, or pampering services like nail, brow and blow bars. It\u2019s wise to make this fit with the store\u2019s brand \u2013 or a particular element. It is no accident that Selfridges\u2019 Hemsley + Hemsley clean eating restaurant is in the London flagship store\u2019s Body Studio.\nEncourage customers to socialise and they\u2019re also more likely to get involved in the store\u2019s brand. Marketing expert Michael Solomon\u2019s new book talks about \u201creturn on involvement\u201d (a play on return on investment) \u2013 get them more involved and the cash tills ring louder.\n4. Be unique\nInnovative retailers offer \u201conly at this store\u201d experiences \u2013 Bergdorf Goodman of New York\u2019s exclusive distribution deals with emerging designers, for example. Mitsukoshi of Tokyo boasts a famous rooftop garden, while the world\u2019s largest department store, Shinsegae, Busan in South Korea has an ice rink, spa, indoor golf space and cinema.\nThe concept store has emerged in recent years: department store variety, but on a smaller scale. Many are seen as destination stores. For instance Tenoha, with outlets in Tokyo and Milan, features a co-working cafe, a private meetings room and an events and pop-up space.\nSuccessful department stores also tend to have a very individual aesthetic. As well as Selfridges and Fortnum & Mason in London, the likes of Ilum in Copenhagen, Saks Fifth Avenue in New York, Grieder in Zurich and TsUM in Moscow can all testify to this.\n5. Brand, brand, brand\nWhat is the brand identity of Debenhams? Or House of Fraser? A department store needs to have a brand with a purpose. Strong examples in the UK include Selfridges, which is built around creativity and vision, while Liberty of London is about opulence, decoration and pattern. I\u2019d also still include John Lewis, which is about value and integrity \u2013 its new ten-year strategy heavily prioritises innovation and service."}

Its board banned the sale of menthol cigarettes and other flavored tobacco, which voters will consider in June, and prohibited performances by exotic animals. In 2016, San Francisco approved what was then a groundbreaking paid parental leave law, requiring private employers to offer six weeks of fully paid leave.\nIf passed, the fur ban would go into effect Jan. 1 and apply to coats and anything else featuring real fur, including key chains and gloves.\n\"I hope that it inspires other cities and the country to take action. Certainly we need better federal regulations on fur farming,\" said Katy Tang, the supervisor pushing the legislation and avid animal lover. \"There's no humane way to raise an animal to peel its skin off.\"\nSome of the tourists who pack downtown San Francisco hotels shop at upscale department stores that crowd Union Square, such as Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue, both of which feature fur salons. Larger stores may have an easier time adapting, but smaller businesses might find it more challenging.\nBenjamin Lin, 72, owns one of those small businesses. The showroom at B.B. Hawk in the South of Market neighborhood features chinchilla, sable, fox, and Blackglama mink. In a corner, Lin is working on restoring a 60-year-old jacket made of cheetah.\nHe is considering keeping his current location but selling fur at a smaller place nearby, outside San Francisco.\n\"I cannot fight it,\" he said of the ban. \"I will not win. I do not have the energy and the money.\"\nSkip Pas, chief executive officer of West Coast Leather, said fur items make up only a small portion of his inventory so he won't be affected much.\nBut he's appalled that 11 people on a board can arbitrarily tell retailers what they can sell, without a vote by the public, and at a time when the city has more pressing issues, such as dirty streets and homelessness.\n\"It's the people of San Francisco who should say, 'Yes, it's too much,'\" he said. \"What's next? They're going to say that you can't have beef and you can't have pork and duck in Chinatown. I mean, it's a little too much.\"\nAbout 50 clothing and accessory retailers in the downtown and South of Market shopping corridor will be affected by the legislation, said Jim Lazarus, senior vice president of public policy at the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce.\nThe chamber estimates San Francisco fur sales account for at least $40 million a year. The city's Office of Economic Analysis estimated fur sales at $11 million in 2012, based on census figures.\nThe city says that even if sales numbers are much higher than its estimate, a prohibition is unlikely to significantly harm the overall local economy.\nThe proposal would allow the resale of vintage and used fur, but only by outlets not usually in the business of trading fur, such as secondhand stores, pawn shops and nonprofits. Items with fur taken from animals trapped under a state license can be sold.\nTang, the supervisor, said she feels bad for furriers like Lin.\n\"But I think it is wrong to profit off the backs of animals,\" she said.\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

You just come out of the show feeling happy!\u201d\nTom certainly does.\n\u201cI was with The Wanted for six years, and theatre had never really crossed my path, but the producers of Grease came to my management and said would I like to come to audition for the Teen Angel part.\n\u201cI went along to the auditions and they came back and asked if I would like to play the part of Danny.\n\u201cI can\u2019t say I had had a lot of theatre experience, but I went in with an open mind, and I worked on myself. I went to some acting classes, and I was just really keen to spread my wings.\n\u201cWhen you do something for so long, like I did with The Wanted, when you come out of it, it is a bit like going into the unknown.\n\u201cIt was a scary time in some ways, but like I said, I was wanting to spread my wings, and this was just completely coincidental.\u201d\nHad he been cast as the Teen Angel, then undoubtedly, he would have been happy, Tom says. But now he is Danny, he wouldn\u2019t take any other role. It\u2019s a great part to play.\nHe quickly felt at home on the stage: \u201cFor someone that is used to being on the stage with a successful pop band, you do feel at home I think \u2013 even if you are doing something different.\n\u201cAnd Danny is such a fun character to play. It\u2019s a really tough one to play, though. It\u2019s such an iconic role. It\u2019s about finding a balance between putting your own stamp on the character and also giving people what they want and know from John Travolta in the film.\n\u201cJohn Travolta made the character so iconic. You want to give people what they have come for, but also you don\u2019t want to be just copying what he did.\n\u201cPersonally, I feel I am playing the character a bit younger than John did. I am playing him much more as the 16-year-old he is supposed to be, but while still trying to include some of that John Travolta swagger.\u201d\nEight shows a week, two on a Friday and a Saturday, it has all proved harder than Tom thought it would be: \u201cBut that stage feels like home even if it is actually very different to being on stage with a band in front of your own fans.\u201d\nHe feels he has come a long way since starting out in the role back in March.\n\u201cI am so different now! If you could look at my first performances, I was like a petrified little kid. I can remember exactly how I felt.\n\u201cIt was my first-ever musical-theatre show. I was just concentrating on not forgetting the words, but now I feel so much more comfortable and can trust in my own ability. The next time I do a show I won\u2019t have that doubt that you get when you have never done a show before.\u201d\nAnd so yes, this is where Tom sees his future career going.\n\u201cI am having conversations about a few different shows for next year. I didn\u2019t really know what to expect with this one because I didn\u2019t really have anything to compare it with, but now I really can compare and know that I will enjoy it.\u201d"}

According to Google, this project is partially inspired by Google's \"Motion Stills\" app, which \"converts short videos into cinemagraphs and time lapses\" through the use of experimental rendering technologies.\nThe first app in the line-up, Storyboard, is an interesting one. Users can upload their own video clips to the app and allow it to automatically select what it deems to be an interesting group of frames and turn them into one highly stylized comic strip. Currently, Storyboard is only available to Android users.\nThe second app called Scrubbies is restricted to iOS users at the moment. The app allows you to become a video DJ of sorts. The app works by recording the speed and direction of left or right two-fingered swiping gestures, allowing you to create a short looping video with the result.\nThe final app in Google's photography experimentation arsenal is Selfissimo!, an app that simulates your own personal photo shoot. The app encourages you to \"strike a pose,\" automatically taking a black-and-white photo whenever you stand still. Selfissimo! is available to both iOS and Android users.\nThough these apps might seem like little more than silly diversions, it's clear that Google has taken the project seriously. According to Google Researcher Alex Kauffmann, the apps \"rely on object recognition, person segmentation, stylization algorithms, efficient image encoding and decoding technologies\" to function properly."}

What sounded like a luxurious and fun cruise to Cartagena, Colombia, turned out to be a fiery nightmare for the \"Real Housewives of New York City\" cast, who recently embarked on a South American journey together. The New York Post reports their \"cruise ship\" turned out to be old, rickety and small -- and that was just the beginning of the voyage's problems. \"Once they were ushered on board, the boat couldn't even move. The anchor got stuck, so the crew had to saw the anchor off before they could sail anywhere. When they got out to sea, the engine caught fire. It was a huge blaze and the crew was fighting to put it out. They didn't have a fire extinguisher nor did they speak English,\" said a source. When the boat hit some rough water, the insider said \"seats and other things on board that weren't nailed down started flying about.\" It didn't help that the boat had only come stocked with two or three life jackets -- and at one point, the boat was starting to fill with water. The cast's response? General hysteria -- and some vomiting. \"They all thought they were going to die and they were hysterical. Bethenny [Frankel], Ramona [Singer] and Dorinda [Medley] were soaked and screaming hysterically, Carole [Radziwill] and Tinsley [Mortimer] were literally throwing up from seasickness. They were far out to sea and they thought they were going down like the Titanic,\" said the source. A \"passing boat\" ultimately managed to get the ladies to safety. They have reportedly been offered counseling by Bravo , which issued a statement about the report to the Post. \"The 'Real Housewives of New York City' cast was recently on a boat in South America and encountered turbulent water,\" said a rep in a statement. \"Thankfully, everyone is fine and was able to continue their vacation as planned. The safety of our cast and crew is paramount and, to that end, we are doing a full investigation.\"\nRELATED: 'Real Housewives' villains"}

This was because they could not appeal effectively once they were out of England.\nThe ruling said deportees could not give appeal evidence by video link from abroad because the cost and practicalities of doing so presented insurmountable barriers.\nThis breached Article Eight of the European human rights charter, which guarantees respect for private and family life, the judges said. Lord Wilson said of the \u2018deport first\u2019 process: \u2018The proper analysis is that the Home Secretary has failed to establish that it is fair.\n\u2018For their appeals to be effective, they would need at least to be afforded the opportunity to give live evidence\n\u2018They would almost certainly not be able to do so in person. The question is: as a second best, would they be able to do so on screen? \u2018The evidence of the Home Secretary is that in such appeals applications to give evidence from abroad are very rare.\nYesterday the Mail reported the case of Wilfred Mosira, a sex offender convicted at the age of 25 of offences with a 13-year-old girl. He won a claim to be able to stay in Britain in the Court of Appeal\n\u2018Why? Is it because an appellant has no interest in giving oral evidence in support of his appeal? I think not. It is because the financial and logistical barriers to his giving evidence on screen are almost insurmountable.\u2019\nThe case is the third reverse in just a week for the Government\u2019s attempts to deport foreign criminals.\nOn Monday the Daily Mail revealed that an Al Qaeda terrorist caught with manuals detailing how to attack nightclubs and airports had been given \u00a3250,000 in legal aid to try to avoid being deported to Jordan.\nYesterday the Mail reported the case of Wilfred Mosira, a sex offender convicted at the age of 25 of offences with a 13-year-old girl.\nLord Justice Sales said \u2018it is not fair to Mr Mosira\u2019 for the Government\u2019s lawyers to raise \u2018at the eleventh hour\u2019 the arguments that could have seen him thrown out of the country\nHe won a claim to be able to stay in Britain in the Court of Appeal.\nThe refugee, who has been found to face no danger or risk at all if returned to his country, Zimbabwe, won his case on legal technicalities that judges said would make his deportation unfair.\nBetween 2014 and the end of last year 1,175 foreign criminals were deported under the Immigration Act on the authority of deportation certificates issued by the Home Secretary.\nOnly 72 had begun an appeal process from abroad. By February, not one of the appeals had succeeded.\nMrs May was Home Secretary when the law was passed and remained in post until she became Prime Minister last summer.\nA spokesman for the Home Office, which is now led by Amber Rudd, said: \u2018The Government has consistently taken the view that foreign criminals have no place in the UK, and we will continue to take action to remove them.\n'We are disappointed by the judgment and are carefully considering the implications.\u2019"}

REUTERS\/Hamad I Mohammed\/File Photo\nDUBAI Saudi Arabia's decision to cut tax paid by national oil giant Saudi Aramco has increased its value by $1 trillion, an analyst estimated on Tuesday ahead of Aramco's initial public offer of shares, expected to be the world's largest.\nThe government said on Monday it was cutting the tax rate for Aramco to 50 percent from 85 percent as part of preparations for next year's IPO, which would sell as much as 5 percent of the company.\n\"By drastically reducing the tax rate, more cash will go to the potential owners of Saudi Aramco compared to the government,\" said Espen Erlingsen, vice-president for analysis at Rystad Energy, an oil and gas consulting service based in Oslo and New York.\n\"Assuming long-term oil prices averaging $75 per barrel, the valuation of the company increases from $0.4 trillion to $1.4 trillion,\" he said in a report.\nThat is good news for the Saudi government, which hopes to raise money to cover a $79 billion budget deficit and invest in new industries as it tries to diversify the economy in an era of low oil prices.\nDeputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who leads economic reforms, has said the IPO will value Aramco at a minimum of $2 trillion. A number much smaller than that could jeopardize the offer and damage his own political position.\nErlingsen calculated Aramco's value based on discounted free cash flow for each oil field. Under the new tax rate, much of the company's payments to the government are expected to be in the form of dividends, not tax.\n\"The total value of Saudi Aramco's revenue after costs is around $3.4 trillion. With the old tax system, around 88 percent of the value went to the government through taxes and royalties, while with the new system around 60 percent of the profit goes to the government,\" Erlingsen said.\nHe predicted oil prices would reach $75 by the time of the IPO, which would be near the long-term price needed to justify the share prices of other large global oil companies.\nGlobal consultants Sanford C. Bernstein & Co said in a report that since Aramco had not released detailed financial information, it was impossible to make a reliable estimate of its value.\nBut they said the size of Saudi oil reserves, larger than those of other oil companies, suggested Aramco could look cheap even at $2 trillion - although that figure excluded factors such as political risks.\nUsing a different valuation method, enterprise value per flowing barrel, suggests a figure in the range of $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion, though the expected long life of Aramco's reserves compared with other companies means Aramco could command a premium to those numbers, Bernstein said.\nInvestment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co estimated a valuation of $1.1 trillion for Aramco, assuming free cash flow of $55 billion a year from its upstream operations.\n(Reporting by Ron Bousso and Rania El Gamal; Writing by Andrew Torchia; Editing by Louise Heavens)"}
{"id":"5981a229-543c-477e-87cd-eb5aebafc87c","text":"Much of President Trump's political strength comes from the fact that he won in places Republicans usually don't.\nIn November, long-time Democratic states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin flipped from blue to red. He nearly did it here in Minnesota, too, a place that hasn't gone Republican since 1972.\n\"I didn't see it coming and most people didn't, obviously,\" former Minnesota state Sen. Tom Saxhaug said, as he looked out from seat in the front window of the Brewed Awakenings coffee shop in downtown Grand Rapids, Minn. Saxhaug is now retired, retired because support for Trump in this area helped swamp his own re-election bid. The Democrat (or more precisely the Democratic Farm Labor Party, or DFL) lost by a just 545 votes in November.\nTrump broke through in the Upper Midwest in a way no Republican has in a generation. But one of the lesser-covered or understood states where that was true was the liberal stronghold of Minnesota. The state stayed blue, but barely. Trump lost it by less than 2 percentage points, the best finish by a Republican in 32 years.\nTrump's populist message resonated with blue-collar white voters \u2014 something that has the potential to reshape the political map. But some of those same voters, though they remain supportive, are sending something of a warning signal \u2014 they wish he would be more presidential.\n\"There's a bit too much drama for me sometimes, with the tweeting,\" said Dean Morgan, a Trump voter and owner of SONSHINE Muffler and Brake, a religious-themed muffler- and brake-repair shop just a few blocks from Saxhaug's perch at the coffee shop.\nThe Iron Range\nThat was a sentiment heard repeatedly here in this mild-mannered Midwestern town of just under 11,000 people. It sits in the heart of Minnesota's eighth congressional district. It's a large and, in parts, rural district that extends some 300 miles, all the way from the Twin Cities' suburbs up to the Canadian border and includes the \"Iron Range.\"\nThe Iron Range is home to mines of high-grade manganese ore that first opened after the Industrial Revolution at the turn of the 20th Century. It long supported this area, but fell on hard times in the 1980s, like a lot of other areas home to American manufacturing and steel companies. Efforts to diversify its economy have sputtered.\nIn this district, the exurbs give way to forests with too many lakes to count. It eventually hits mine country in the Iron Range. People here like to say the economy is all about \"the Three T's,\" Taconite, Timber and Tourism.\"\nIn less alliterative language, that's mining, forests and lakes. And with a population that's some 93 percent white, this congressional district has lots of the white, working-class voters who represent a big bloc of Trump's support.\nIt's also one that has long been solidly Democratic. That all changed in 2016, going for Trump by better than 15 percentage points.\n'Wish he were a little more reserved'\nA cross, rays of sunlight and \"JESUS\" in large block letters are all prominent on the signage of Morgan's auto-repair shop. Morgan is a born-again Christian, and he believes Trump is one, too.\nEven though that's not true \u2014 religious-right leader James Dobson had to walk back that same claim last summer \u2014 the thrice-married billionaire former playboy won a whopping 81 percent of white, born-again evangelicals in the 2016 election.\nMorgan said though he's still supporting the president, \"I wish he were a little more reserved, if you know what I'm saying.\"\nAsked if the Trump presidency has been what he expected, he hesitated before answering, \"You know it has, and it hasn't.\"\nGreg Gilness, a 66-year-old former steelworker, said of Trump: \"He's got a lot to learn.\"\nHe added with clear frustration: \"I think he has to learn to be more presidential. He has just got to conduct himself like he's the president of a great power.\"\nGilness stressed that he isn't a member of a political party and that he \"votes for the person.\" He wouldn't disclose which person he voted for in the presidential election. But, at times, he sure sounded like a Trump voter.\n\"I was leaning toward him,\" Gilness admitted, \"but I won't tell you how I actually voted.\"\nHe spoke to Trump's appeal. \"People are looking for hope,\" he said, \"and he [Trump] gave a lot of people a little bit of hope to hang onto.\"\nThat hope for Gilness specifically was economic. His plant closed down, and while he transitioned to an office job for the same company, he said he believes Trump will be very good for the mining industry. He expects Trump to do something about low-cost, imported steel \u2014 as he's promised.\nRep. Rick Nolan holds a town hall in Virginia, Minn., Wednesday. The Democrat won a narrow victory in his district in one of the most expensive contests in the country in 2016. Don Gonyea | NPR\nSplit ticket: A Democrat in what's now a Trump district\nThere's a wrinkle \u2014 Gilness would say one person he voted for: his congressman, Rick Nolan, a Democrat.\nGilness was actually at a Nolan event when he talked to NPR. Nolan has served the district since 2012. He previously served two terms in Congress in the 1970s, too.\nNolan held on to win a narrow victory in one of the closest and most expensive contests in the country last year. He's been holding town-hall style meetings all across the district during the current congressional recess.\nThe sessions have been courteous and polite, with none of the rancor and shouting that has marked some town halls around the country this year. Nolan spends time at each pointing out problems with the budget Trump has proposed, with cuts that he says will be bad for this region.\n\"Funding for the National Forest Service is gutted,\" Nolan said in an old city-council chamber in the small mining town of Virginia, Minn.\nSo, too, Nolan said, is money for \"transportation, and funding for the Great Lakes.\"\nA mixed political bag\nRight across the street from the coffee shop, is a giant mural painted on the side of the building just across the street. It features the iconic characters from the classic film \"The Wizard of Oz.\"\nIt's there because the movie's biggest star, Judy Garland, was born in Grand Rapids in 1922. (Fun Fact: Also born in this district \u2014 in Duluth \u2014 was songwriter, and now Nobel laureate, Bob Dylan, who grew up just up the road in the town of Hibbing.)\nAs Saxhaug talks Trump, it's clear there's plenty he disagrees with. This self-described \"pro-gun, pro-mining, union-Democrat\" said of the president, \"He can't concentrate on anything long enough to accomplish anything. I'm real, real worried about the fact that he goes from one thing to another.\"\nHe did not vote for Trump, but now, nearly 100 days into Trump's presidency, Saxhaug said, he is pulling for Trump to succeed. He said he'd be happy to back the kind of big infrastructure spending Trump has talked about (but not yet officially proposed in his budget or in specific legislation). He also noted that he could get behind tax reform, too \u2014 if it's done fairly.\n\"Just to be clear, you're a Democrat saying this,\" this reporter noted.\n\"Yeah,\" he replied.\n\"You're one of those Democrats who legitimately says you want him to do well, because that's good for the country?\"\n\"That's exactly right,\" he said emphatically.\nBut other Democrats in the coffee shop were not so magnanimous.\nAt a table over by the far wall, retired public-school teacher Frieda Hall was having lunch with a friend. She said she's been \"mortified\" by what she's seen from President Trump so far.\nThe GOP campaign headquarters for Itasca County, Minn., once was a place to go for oil changes. Now, it awaits its next life. Trump easily carried the county that former President Obama won twice. Don Gonyea | NPR\nAsked if it's what she expected, she replied, emphatically, \"Yes, exactly what I expected \u2014 a total chaotic mess.\"\nShe doesn't trust Trump's judgment, his motivation, or the people he has surrounded himself with in his administration. She did say, though, that Trump has kept one promise \u2014 to be a disruptive force.\n\"He is disrupting the way things work \u2014 and to our detriment, and with no set goal,\" she said.\nHall then asked, \"Like the goal of disruption is what? To disrupt? And then what?\"\nA call to end the drama\nLike him, or dislike him, people here in this place Trump won, tell you they want him to act more like a president. It was a common thread.\nThey want an end to all the drama. World events are dramatic enough, they seem to be saying.\nFor his critics, it's yet another reason to judge him negatively.\nBut for those who like him, they will often just shrug and say, \"That's just who he is.\" And they find a reason to like him.\nBack at the brake shop, while Morgan says he wishes Trump would be more presidential, he shows no sign of abandoning him.\nHe was quick to praise the president on foreign policy, for example, including the missile strike on Syria.\n\"I kind of go along with what what they're doing right now,\" Morgan said, adding about Syrian President Bashar Assad, \"I mean, this guy is killing babies with gas.\n\"It's like, 'Come on dude,' you know?

Bunche Center for African American Studies at UCLA, which is headed by Darnell Hunt.\n\u201cIn both film and television, women and minorities remained notably underrepresented in every arena in 2016,\u201d the report stated. \u201cReports in this series have repeatedly found that films and television shows with casts attuned to America\u2019s diversity tend to register the highest global box office figures and viewer ratings. The industry appears to have finally embraced the idea that America\u2019s increasingly diverse audiences demand film and television content populated with characters whose experiences resonate with their own, who look like them, and with whom they can relate.\u201d\nGains were primarily confined to digital scripted shows for female leads, broadcast television for leads, and show creators of color. The report emphasized that positive trends for women and minorities in film were fewer and less prominent.\n\u201cThere is still a long way to go before women or people of color reach proportionate representation among the actors in film and television, but at least the trend lines for both groups point in the right direction,\u201d the report said.\n\u201cUnfortunately, the industry has been much slower to accept the related truth that its success in providing today\u2019s (and tomorrow\u2019s) audiences with what they crave also hinges on the presence of diverse talent behind the camera \u2014 in the director\u2019s chair, in the writers\u2019 room, and in executive suites,\u201d it said. \u201cThe resulting missed opportunities, this report series has documented, are not good for Hollywood\u2019s bottom line.\u201d\nThe report said Hollywood decision makers tend to promote the myth that foreign audiences will automatically reject films centered around people of color \u2014 a notion that militates against the advancement of diversity, particularly for leading actors and directors. The report was written before the launch of Disney-Marvel\u2019s \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d which has grossed eye-popping sums \u2014 more than $700 million in less than two weeks.\nThe researchers behind the report found that minorities remain underrepresented in film leads (13.9 percent), film directors (12.6 percent), film writers (8.1 percent), broadcast scripted leads (18.7 percent), cable scripted leads (20.2 percent), broadcast reality and other leads (26.6 percent) and leads for cable reality and other leads (20.9 percent).\nWomen posted gains in all the key employment arenas since the previous report, with the exception of four \u2014 film directors, broadcast scripted show leads, cable scripted show creators, and broadcast scripted show creators. They are underrepresented among film leads (31.2 percent), film directors (6.9 percent), film writers (13.8 percent), broadcast scripted leads (35.7 percent), cable scripted leads (44.8 percent) and broadcast reality and other leads (18.8 percent)."}
{"id":"2ea5703b-07f6-420b-a8ac-4302a1396dbf","text":"How do you make a movie about stagnation? A movie that doesn't just tell you a story about someone wasting away, but that seems to embody a state of physical and moral decay for nearly two hours?\nIt may not sound like a glowing recommendation, but Lucrecia Martel has made such a movie with Zama, her feverishly brilliant adaptation of Antonio di Benedetto's 1956 novel of the same title. This is one of the most atmospheric and transporting films I've seen all year, and also one of the best.\nDi Benedetto's novel tells the tragicomic story of Don Diego de Zama, an official of the Spanish crown stationed at a remote outpost along the Paraguay River. He was born in the New World but serves the Old, an empire in which he has never once set foot.\nThe year is 1790, and Zama, bored, frustrated and separated from his wife and children, hopes for a transfer to Buenos Aires, where he's certain he will find greater purpose and prosperity. The book, narrated by Zama himself, is a bitterly ironic account of pride, pettiness and self-pity, a devastating critique of European colonialism from the inside.\nZama the movie is remarkably faithful to the book's spirit. Played in a superbly weary, bone-dry performance by Daniel Gim\u00e9nez Cacho, Don Diego de Zama is very much a figure of mockery, but his slowly dawning awareness of his own futility is not without a certain pathos.\nIn the opening shot, we see him standing alone on a beach, wearing a sword and a tricorn hat, and striking a ridiculous, would-be heroic pose. The rest of the movie will slowly lay waste to his delusions of grandeur.\nThe first half plays like a comedy of bureaucratic errors by way of Samuel Beckett, as Zama repeatedly pleads with his superior to write a letter to the king and obtain approval of his transfer. Apart from his occasional duties as a magistrate, Zama mostly just waits and waits, and every scene seems to compound the indignity of his existence.\nHe is forever being ignored by his superiors, thwarted by his colleagues and rebuffed by a noblewoman, Luciana, whom he hopelessly lusts after. She's played by Lola Due\u00f1as, known for her work with Pedro Almod\u00f3var, who is credited as one of the film's producers.\nNo one, however, is likely to mistake Zama for an Almod\u00f3var movie. Martel has little use for straightforward narrative. Her style is immersive yet disorienting: Rather than neatly sorting out the characters' relationships or cutting from one plot point to the next, she creates a highly specific, intricate world that demands and rewards your close attention.\nSurrender to this movie and you might find yourself held rapt by the sheer intensity of Martel's filmmaking. Her sensuous camerawork and wild, teeming sound design, alive with the noises of buzzing insects and screeching birds, conjure an air of stifling humidity. The physical world here is palpably present, and completely indifferent to men like Zama and their arrogant attempts to tame it into submission.\nMartel's previous films, which include The Holy Girl and The Headless Woman, have been sly satires of bourgeois privilege, and her sense of class rage makes her a natural fit for di Benedetto's anti-imperialist takedown. Whereas so many screen adaptations of first-person narratives tend to lose their focus, Martel ingeniously forges her own point of view.\nShe doesn't just march Zama through a series of humiliations. She strategically undermines his position in every shot, often placing him off to the side or dwarfing him visually. Barely a scene goes by in which we aren't made aware of the indigenous slaves employed by Zama and his cohorts, going about their business in the background or foreground, looking on in judgmental silence.\nThese visual strategies may seem odd at first, but they have a real sense of purpose. In refusing to make Zama the center of the frame, the movie reminds us that this man, whatever he may think, is not the hero of his own story.\nThat becomes increasingly apparent in the movie's second half, as the desperate and disenfranchised Zama ventures into the swampy wilderness, joining a dangerous mission to capture an enemy of the empire.\nThe story ends as it must, in a whirlwind of violence, and Martel's precisely controlled imagery turns rapturous, almost in spite of itself. It's a terrifying vision worthy of Werner Herzog and Joseph Conrad. The grand dream of human conquest becomes a nightmarish descent into madness."}

Given Facebook and Instagram\u2019s global reach, full scale rollout could hinder Snap\u2019s plans to accelerate global expansion,\u201d Post said in a Sunday note. (See Post's track record here.)\nFacebook is heavily focused on more standalone apps to drive further expansion. Along with WhatsApp and Messenger, Direct would mark the third major standalone messaging app launched by Facebook and is seen as a potential avenue to expand engagement with younger users that maintain an affinity for Snapchat\u2019s messaging and one-to-one photo sharing.\nDespite initial pushback at the launch of Facebook\u2019s standalone app Messenger, the app now has 1.3 billion monthly active users.

They have been undergoing immense hardship, which needs to be addressed urgently,\u201d said Aditi Bhardwaj, the coordinator of the Highly Skilled Migrants group.\nJavid's letter reveals that between January 2015 and December 2017, 238 applicants challenged the Home Office refusal of an application for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) in the Tier 1 (General) category in the UK courts through a judicial review, of which 189 were against a refusal on 322(5) grounds.\nThese migrants, most of whom are from Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi backgrounds, lose their right to work and access to state-funded healthcare while their application is pending.\n\"Those who have lost their ILR must have it restored and the government must compensate those who have lost their jobs and livelihood and been reduced to destitution,\u201d said Lord Dick Taverne, a Liberal Democrat peer in the House of Lords who has been leading a parliamentary campaign in favour of professionals affected by the issue.\nHe described the Home Office review into the cases, expected to be completed by next week, as a \u201cgreat victory for justice\u201d, adding that it should mark an end to the \u201chostile climate for immigrants\u201d in Britain.\nIn Sajid Javid's letter dated May 25, the minister also reveals that his department has identified 19 individuals who were refused ILR and subsequently made \u201cvoluntary departures\u201d from the UK.\nOne of them has since been issued with a visa to return to the UK, having applied under a different provision of the UK's immigration rules.\n\"This is just the tip of the iceberg as we are certain there are more than 19 people who have been forced to leave due to these unfair refusals by the Home Office. We hope the review will highlight the true nature of this scandal,\u201d said Bhardwaj, whose group has been working with legal experts and politicians to help these professionals and their families.\nBesides a series of protests outside the UK Parliament, the group succeeded in collecting over 32,000 signatures on an online petition demanding the Home Office uses Clause 322(5) for what it was designed to do, \u201cprotect us from terrorists, not deport our doctors, teachers, scientists and lawyers\u201d.\nThe crisis involves migrants from outside the EU who were entitled to apply for ILR or permanent residency status after a minimum of five years' lawful residency in the UK.\nWhile the Tier 1 (General) visa they used was discontinued in 2011, former applicants were eligible to apply for ILR until April this year if they made up the required number of points on their application.\nHowever, legal experts noted a pattern of many such applications being turned down by Home Office caseworkers citing Clause 322(5) of the UK Immigration Act, a discretionary rule aimed at denying convicted criminals and terrorists the right to live in the UK.\nThe Home Office questioned the \u201cgood character\u201d of these professionals over apparent differences in their declared earnings to the UK tax department and the Home Office, resulting in hundreds facing potential deportation unless their appeals are accepted.\n\"We've heard of a series of cases of highly skilled workers, employed in our public services and senior jobs legally for many years, now being told to leave apparently due to minor tax errors. So, it is welcome that the Home Secretary is now reviewing all those cases and putting decisions on hold,\u201d said Labour party MP Yvette Cooper, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee.\nThe influential parliamentary committee has been conducting an investigation into \u201cwider systemic issues\u201d in the UK Home Office ever since the Windrush scandal of Caribbean immigrants being wrongfully deported from the UK emerged last month.\n\u201cA review into the specific HMRC [Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs] related Tier 1 issue is ongoing,\u201d a UK Home Office spokesperson said."}
{"id":"4737267e-1f2a-4587-867c-82e655a8d3db","text":"Getty Images\nThe recent comments from former Patriots defensive end Cassius Marsh are surprising not simply because of their strength but because of their rarity. During the 18 years that Bill Belichick has coached the team, the atmosphere hasn\u2019t changed. So why haven\u2019t more former Patriots popped off?\nOne possibility is that the Patriots misjudged Marsh as someone who would respond well to the New England environment. Belichick and company typically look for \u2014 and find \u2014 players who will buy in to The Patriot Way, which consists (in a nutshell) or having a hard shell that tolerates constant badgering and fear-based motivation, that puts team above individual, and that results in the successful players making financial sacrifices for the greater goal of effective cap management, not just to afford free-agent starters when needed but to have a robust middle class of experienced players who provide depth when injuries inevitably happen.\nEven if Marsh didn\u2019t fit in, he\u2019s hardly the first. So why haven\u2019t past Patriots teed off on Belichick\u2019s methods after leaving the team?\nThe closest anyone else has come to taking shots at The Patriot Way happened nearly three years ago, when receiver Reggie Wayne asked to be released after a short stint in New England because \u201cthe work environment was tough\u201d and Wayne was \u201cnot having fun.\u201d Considering that Wayne occupied a central role on a Colts team that exuded excellence and that featured a strong, detail-obsessed personality at quarterback, the revelation was a bit of a shock.\nBut Wayne never suggested that the sense of unhappiness went beyond himself. Marsh\u2019s comments broadened the focus to include others.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have fun there,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing fun about it. There\u2019s nothing happy about it.\u201d\nThat has prompted some within league circles to wonder whether the Patriots have, over time, lost their nucleus of players who revel in the ends-justify-the-lack-of-fun approach. Players who believe winning is fun enough. Players who willingly accept the fact that championship football is zero fun, sir.\nIf past Patriots teams had a guy like Marsh who was grumbling about not having fun, team leaders would have swooped in immediately and rectified the situation, one way or the other. Marsh wouldn\u2019t have believed that \u201cthey don\u2019t have fun there.\u201d He would have simply concluded that they have a different idea of what fun is.\nAt a time when the discontent has spread to players like quarterback Tom Brady and tight end Rob Gronkowski, maybe there really is a deeper problem in the locker room, where the core of players obsessed with winning has been overcome by a critical mass of players who are sick of being constantly criticized. The tipping point quite possibly came during Super Bowl LII, when Belichick apparently departed from the win-at-all-costs mindset to instead play some sort of mind game with cornerback Malcolm Butler, leaving him on the sideline as the defense couldn\u2019t stop Philadelphia\u2019s offense.\nWhatever the reasons and whatever the trigger, it\u2019s becoming more and more clear that something has changed in New England. And while none of it may matter when it\u2019s time to suit up and play in September, the fact that both Brady and Gronkowski are nowhere to be seen necessarily affects the overall preparation of a team that uses every phase of the calendar as a building block toward the next one.\nIf they and others find themselves resenting Belichick\u2019s ways and questioning the effectiveness of his methods and his message, coach and players could be on a collision course for a level of dysfunction that they may not be able to overcome."}

So, I realised you\u2019ve to be more enthusiastic in giving positive reinforcement.\u201d\nSean Rowland, founder of Hibernia, says the idea for the project came out of Harvard, where academics have been researching ways of digitising the supervision aspects of teacher training.\nCost-saving exercise\nWhile some might suspect that using technology to monitor teaching standards is a cost-saving exercise, Hibernia\u2019s director of primary education Mary Kelly insists it is not the case.\n\u201cThis is an add-on, it can\u2019t be a replacement.

But calls for a boycott are scarcely new for Adele. Last year, after she endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, Trump supporters launched a similar hashtag. Buffeted by the competitive politics of the right and left, the English singer will likely think longingly back to the uncomplicated very first #BoycottAdele hashtag that trended briefly in 2015 after the release of her hit single \"Hello.\"\nIt had nothing to do with politics and everything to do with tea.\nThe millions of fans who have watched the music video of \"Hello\" know that a steaming cup of tea has a central role to play in providing succor to the singer's lovesick heart.\nArtfully stained with sepia and loss, the retro video opens with a deeply depressed Adele walking into a shut-up house enrobed in dustcovers. Outside, it's wickedly cold and blustery. Inside (her broken heart) the temperature's pretty tundra-like too. So while she lavishly mourns the loss of her coffee-drinking lover in song, Adele does what the English do when things look bleak. She pops the kettle on. There's a delicately patterned china cup and saucer waiting to be filled. So far, so good.\nThen, the singer does something absolutely shocking. She pours hot water into the cup and then pops in a tea bag. Instead of the other way around, of course. This casual switching of steps was an outrage and nothing short of tea treason. British twitter sputtered with indignation.\nHow reassuringly English. A country that has fought two opium wars with China to protect its precious tea supply takes the beverage very seriously.\nAsk the man who is the au currant hero, George Orwell. He may have fought totalitarianism all his life, but when it came to making a pot of tea, it was his way or the highway. His popular essay, \"A nice cup of tea,\" is an 11-point disquisition on how to achieve just that. Orwell would have been horrified by Adele's \u2013 and the modern streamlined style of \u2013 tea-making. Not merely by the presence of a teabag but by the absence of a teapot. \"If the tea is not loose in the pot it never infuses properly,\" he declaimed. In order to get a good infusion, one \"should take the teapot to the kettle, and not the other way about. The water should be actually boiling at the moment of impact, which means that one should keep it on the flame while one pours.\"\nAs for that other great anti-totalitarian Brit, John Lennon, he could imagine a world without heaven and religion, but not without tea \u2013 brewed the right way, of course. A few years ago, his widow, Yoko Ono, wrote a piece for The New York Times called \"The Tea Maker,\" in which she affectionately recalled their midnight tea-making kitchen trysts. \"Yoko, Yoko, you're supposed to first put the tea bags in, and then the hot water,\" John would admonish her. And so Ono allowed him to make the tea his way. But, for tea purists, there's an unfortunate twist to this story. As Ono tells it:\nOne night, however, John said: \"I was talking to Aunt Mimi this afternoon and she says you are supposed to put the hot water in first. Then the tea bag. I could swear she taught me to put the tea bag in first, but ...\" \"So all this time, we were doing it wrong?\" \"Yeah ...\" We both cracked up...\nSo Adele should take heart. She has the great Beatle on her side. But though once a committed tea drinker, Adele has given up her 10-cups-a-day habit. Not because of the tea trolls but because of the pounds she was putting on from the heavily sugared cups.\nMeanwhile, her \"Hello\" video has launched a range of \"Hello, it's tea\" merchandise and several cheeky parodies, including changing the soulful line of Lionel Richie's 1983 hit, \"Hello,\" to \"Hello, is it tea you're looking for?\" In another very funny send-up, an English radio presenter rewrote the lyrics to make tea the star. So instead of belting out \"Hello from the other side,\" we have:\nWhere the hell's my cup of tea? My ginger nut needs dunking see Have you even turned the kettle on? I should have had it by now But all my biscuits are gone I love tea It's me and tea.\nOn Sunday night, after an awkward, overwrought but sincere-sounding acceptance speech in which she nervously lavished praise on Beyonc\u00e9, Adele accidentally broke her trophy in half. As if it were a ginger nut biscuit she was dying to dunk into a cup of tea. With all of those boycott hashtags, she could certainly do with a cuppa.\nNina Martyris is a journalist based in Knoxville, Tenn."}

Le Pen sought to do so by hitting her party\u2019s trademark anti-EU, anti-immigration themes hard.\n\u201cFight for victory, until the very last minute,\u201d she said. \u201cIf every patriot can this week convince just one abstentionist, just one undecided voter, we are sure to win!\u201d\nGetting the crowd to boo the European Union and its border-free Schengen area that she would take France out of if elected, Le Pen said: \u201cMass immigration is not an opportunity for France, it\u2019s a tragedy for France.\u201d\nPromising to immediately impose a moratorium on immigration, she said: \u201cThe French sometimes have fewer rights than foreigners \u2013 even illegal ones.\u201d\nSCUFFLES\nScuffles briefly broke out between 60 to 80 anti-FN protesters and police near the Zenith concert hall in north-east Paris ahead of the rally, a Reuters photographer said.\nPolice fired teargas at the protesters, some of whom threw chunks of wood. The protesters then left, followed by a small group of police.\nDuring Le Pen\u2019s speech, one young woman jumped on the stage and was immediately carried away by security and a topless woman later shouted out from the middle of the concert hall in an apparent protest against the candidate.\nFN lawmaker Gilbert Collard told reporters on arriving at the hall that he was hit in the neck by a beer bottle and that other objects were aimed at him before police intervened. Another FN official, Jean Messiha, said he saw a couple of Molotov cocktails being thrown. Reuters could not verify either comment.\nA few hours earlier on the other side of Paris, Le Pen\u2019s most likely run-off opponent, Macron, addressed a crowd nearly four times larger in another concert hall and struck a starkly different, pro-European tone.\nBut Le Pen\u2019s supporters dismissed her opponent and his ideas.\n\u201cMacron is a pure marketing product,\u201d said 26 year-old Veronique Fornilli, an FN youth activist in the Paris region. \u201cOnly Le Pen can put France back in order,\u201d she said, also praising the FN leader for her anti-EU, anti-euro stance.\n\u201cI want to give France its freedom back, I want to take it out of jail,\u201d Le Pen said of her plans to pull the country out of the euro."}

The London-based businessman and vocal Kremlin critic had been arrested in Madrid on what Browder says was a Russian warrant issued through Interpol.\nFormerly a major investor in Russia, Browder has spent the better part of a decade waging an international crusade against corruption in Russian President Vladimir Putin's government. He pushed for the 2012 Magnitsky Act, which punished several prominent Russians with U.S. sanctions, and lately he has spoken frequently of Russian attempts to influence the domestic affairs of other countries.\nIn fact, Browder said it was this \"mission\" that brought him to Madrid \u2014 until, that is, Spanish police detained him. Authorities released Browder just a few hours later, but not before he fired off several tweets chronicling the arrest as it unfolded.\n\"Urgent: Just was arrested by Spanish police in Madrid on a Russian Interpol arrest warrant,\" he announced to his followers Thursday morning. \"Going to the police station right now.\"\nHe even tweeted a picture of the apparent warrant from the Spanish federal government, seeking his arrest for fraud, which a Russian court has convicted him of in absentia.\nHe was released just a few hours later, after remaining in custody \"for the minimum necessary time,\" the Spanish National Police Corps said.\nIt was not long before Browder hopped on a plane out of Spain and put the arrest in his rear view \u2014 but questions continue to eddy around why, exactly, the activist and commentator was arrested in the first place.\nBrowder asserted that his detainment came because Russia had obtained an active Interpol Red Notice, or a formal request that one Interpol member country arrest a suspect based on a valid warrant issued by another member country. He noted that Thursday's dust-up was, in fact, \"the result of a SIXTH Russian arrest warrant using Interpol channels.\"\nRussia allegedly tried so many times to arrest him, in fact, that Browder wrote a whole book about those attempts, titled Red Notice.\n\"It's all very scary,\" Browder told NPR's Rachel Martin last fall. \"It's not just arrest. They could try to assassinate me on the street. They've made these threats, and so I am genuinely Putin's No. 1 foreign enemy, and they'd like to wipe me out one way or another.\"\nSpanish law enforcement said officers let Browder go after it was \"verified by INTERPOL Spain that the arrest warrant issued by the Russian authorities for tax evasion was invalid.\"\n\"An arrest warrant has a date limit and when that expires, it must be deleted from the computer programme and in this case Interpol hadn't deleted it,\" a police spokesperson clarified to Agence France-Presse.\nYet Interpol denies that there was even an official Red Notice to begin with.\n\"There is not, and never has been, a Red Notice for Mr Bill Browder,\" the international law enforcement agency told NPR in a brief emailed statement, adding that \"Mr Browder is not wanted via INTERPOL channels.\"\nThe agency, which has 192 member countries, did not clarify further.\nWhile Russia has \"repeatedly repeatedly requested Mr. Browder's arrest through Interpol,\" The New York Times reports, \"... its requests have been refused repeatedly. In 2013, in a rare and sharp rebuke, Interpol said Russia's request to arrest Mr. Browder 'was of a predominately political nature.' \"\nIt remains unclear, then, how the warrant surfaced and drew Spanish law enforcement's attention Wednesday.\nAt any rate, Browder landed in London safely later Wednesday, noting that he was \"no worse for the wear.\"\n\"Getting ready for more Magnitsky sanctions advocacy next week,\" he tweeted."}

{"id":"47b373d3-0d80-4e73-954c-ed7c3afd2933","text":"Renewable energy is driving profound changes in cities. It\u2019s happening much more quickly than was expected even five years ago. Responding to climate change, networks of decision-makers, such as the C40 collective of major cities, have begun adopting strategies to promote the uptake of renewable energy. Yet land use planning has seemingly begun to lag behind.\nAs an example, few, if any, planning codes in Australia prevent overshadowing of rooftop solar systems (photovoltaic and hot water). Instead, disputes are being decided in the courts.\nEffective guidance on the retrofitting and redesign of built environment energy systems must occur across scales, from rooftops to wider electricity grids. We need reliable institutional and policy guidelines to improve investment certainty and limit negative outcomes.\nSo what is the role of planning? What challenges and actions must planners consider for the renewable energy transition to be effective?\nTony Matthews, Jason Byrne , Author provided 9.44 MB (download) The Urban Squeeze S01Ep05 - Energy Futures.\nRenewable are proliferating\nHistorically, cities have been built on fossil fuels. These power buildings, lighting, transport, air conditioning, water supply systems, sewage treatment and more.\nTechnological change and concerns about climate change threats, energy security, air pollution reduction and fossil fuel power costs have recently driven huge advancements in renewable energy options for cities. As renewables rapidly gain market traction, the costs are falling dramatically relative to fossil fuel options.\nMany different types of renewable energy have the potential to radically transform built environments. These include solar (both photovoltaic and molten salt), wind, tidal, biogas, biofuel, pumped hydro and potentially even nuclear fusion \u2013 though the latter may still be some time away.\nAt present, this technological growth appears to be outpacing land-use planning systems, and many planners seem to be fighting a rear-guard action.\nWhat role can planners play?\nTraditionally, planners have assessed the acceptability, or otherwise, of different types of development. Land uses that were deemed incompatible were separated into different zones.\nInfrastructural and technological provisions associated with developments are usually strategically planned in advance. Site-specific issues are then assessed through development approval processes.\nThere are, however, still relatively few land use planning policies and guidelines for engaging effectively with renewable energy. This is a global problem, though some jurisdictions are ahead of others.\nA front-runner is the UK, where the Department for Communities and Local Government issued planning practice guidance for renewable and low-carbon energy in 2013. This was a welcome early response. And perhaps surprising, given the comparative lack of sunlight in the UK.\nConversely, Ireland still lacks a strategic plan for solar farm development. This seems remiss given Ireland has an almost identical planning system and roughly the same amount of sunlight as the UK.\nIn sunnier Australia, the signs are that things are beginning to change. For example, the New South Wales government recently issued guidelines on the approval of solar and wind farms. Queensland has a wind farm state code and guidelines. The City of Melbourne now provides planning guidance for solar energy.\nCalifornia is forging ahead with solar leasing and is experimenting with mandatory solar for new buildings. The state is also making strides in wind energy.\nHow should planning systems adapt?\nWe urgently need more renewable-friendly planning systems to capture its potential benefits and avoid overshooting the 2\u00b0C target for global warming. This will mean finding ways to \u201cfast-track\u201d energy generation deemed to be low risk with manageable impacts.\nAs well as developing practical guidance, planners need to ask some key questions. Are these technologies safe? Might they disrupt other land uses? Does large-scale uptake potentially have unintended consequences?\nAn easy win for planners is to devise codes and planning scheme provisions to protect rooftop solar installations from overshadowing. Rooftop solar is becoming an integral part of the energy mix in many areas, with surplus production often feeding back into the grid.\nA failure of planning to manage a simple issue like overshadowing will result in a loss of potential electricity production, with negative implications for householders and grids.\nMedium-scale commercial solar PV farms, providing 1-10MW generating capacity, are likely soon to be a common feature of many suburbs and communities. However, these facilities can present challenges when placed in urban areas. Again, clear planning guidance is needed.\nThe planning implications of these solar PV farms are only beginning to be understood. The issues include, but are not limited to, site selection, (re)zoning, stakeholder engagement, visual impact minimisation and mediating social, economic and\/or ecological constraints.\nEven as planners begin to engage with the issues of current renewable technologies, newer technologies are quickly encroaching. This adds to the urgency of the planning challenges; constant reappraisal is needed.\nWhere to next?\nSoon we will likely have to better consider emerging technologies such as solar windows, integrated solar roofs, backyard biogas generators and even algae biofuel farming.\nFor example, could using backyard waste-to-biogas systems create issues with hygiene and infectious disease? What about maintenance? Will microgrids, which can help transitions to a grid with significant volumes of renewable energy, be able to handle demand?\nWe\u2019ll need effective land use planning to answer these questions and many more. In times of intense transformation, planners will have to provide clear guidance. They must not let themselves fall behind the pace of urban energy transitions."}

But the way the Toronto Maple Leafs forward said it made it sound like a negative character trait.\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a loyal guy in general,\u201d said Martin, who spent the past six seasons as Tavares\u2019 teammate with the New York Islanders. \u201cObviously, I\u2019ve gotten the questions all year long \u2014 what\u2019s going to happen (when Tavares becomes an unrestricted free agent in 2018) \u2014 and I don\u2019t know. I do know he\u2019s a loyal guy and he wants to win on Long Island.\u201d\nThat\u2019s too bad. It\u2019s a shame, really. If Tavares were a bit more selfish, a bit less devoted to a team and a fan base that does not seem as devoted to him, he one day might have a chance to win a Stanley Cup.\nAt the very least, the 26-year-old wouldn\u2019t be wasting away his prime years playing for a team that doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s competing to win now, rebuilding, or even relocating from Brooklyn, N.Y.\n\u201cI have said it in the past \u2014 I want to be on the Island, that is where I hope everything works out,\u201d said Tavares, who can\u2019t re-negotiate a new deal until July 1. \u201cI think we all know there is a lot more, a lot more goes into it than just saying you want to be there. Negotiations happen and there is a process that goes about it, so for me it is just going through all that. I have not really thought too much about it \u2026 I love playing here and hope to be here.\u201d\nWhile his loyalty to the Islanders is unquestioned, the team hasn\u2019t exactly shown as much love for its only superstar. If they did, Tavares wouldn\u2019t be playing on a line with a sixth-round pick or a winger who in his eighth season has never scored more than 41 points.\nOf course, it\u2019s nothing new for Tavares, who is the reason why Anders Lee (21 goals and 34 points prior to Tuesday night\u2019s game) and Joshua Bailey (11 goals and 38 points) are having breakout seasons. Throughout his career, Tavares has been asked to apply the Midas touch to sub-standard talent, whether it was Matt Moulson and P.A. Parenteau or Kyle Okposo and Frans Nielsen.\nAs Martin said of Tavares: \u201cOver the years, he\u2019s definitely made a lot of guys a lot of money.\u201d\nSince he was drafted first overall in 2009, only four players have scored more goals than Tavares (227): Alex Ovechkin (332), Steven Stamkos (298), Corey Perry (250) and Sidney Crosby (236). As of Tuesday morning, that put him ahead of the likes of Phil Kessel and Joe Pavelski (226), Patrick Marleau (225), Patrick Kane and Jeff Carter (224). Two years ago, Tavares finished second in league scoring and was a finalist for the Hart Trophy. And yet, New York has not exactly taken advantage of having a superstar in its lineup.\nOver the last seven years, the Islanders have qualified for the playoffs three times. They have won just one round. In four of those seasons, the Islanders ranked last or second-last in league attendance, never climbing higher than 25th overall.\nLast year\u2019s playoff win against the Florida Panthers seemed like a step in the right direction for the team and its new home in Brooklyn, N.Y. But after letting Okposo and Nielsen walk as free agents, the team started the season 17-17-8 and fired head coach Jack Capuano. With an average attendance of 12,829 fans \u2014 second-lowest in the league behind only Carolina \u2014 Bloomberg News reported last week that Barclays Center ownership is prepared to move the team out of the arena.\nFor most players, this would be an excuse to explore free agency or even demand a trade. But if Tavares wants out, he hasn\u2019t shown it. Quite the opposite.\nHeading into Tuesday night\u2019s game against the Toronto Maple Leafs, Tavares was in the top-30 in scoring with 46 points, having scored nine goals and 19 points in his last 15 games. In the process, he has almost singlehandedly pulled the Islanders, who a month ago were sitting at the bottom of the Eastern Conference standings, into an unlikely playoff spot.\n\u201cI think he puts too much on himself, but that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d said interim head coach Doug Weight, who was Tavares\u2019 teammate for the first two years of his career. \u201cHe wants challenges and he wants to be the leader on and off the ice. And he is. He\u2019s a great captain and a huge piece to our team.\u201d\nWinning a Stanley Cup is ultimately the biggest challenge \u2014 bigger than even winning over fans in Brooklyn \u2014 and it\u2019s ultimately what could keep Tavares in New York. After all, the reason why Stamkos re-signed in Tampa Bay last summer was because the team had the other pieces in place to contend for a championship. Even with top prospect Mathew Barzal in the pipeline, the Islanders are far from that goal.\nIn other words, before the Islanders can think about re-signing Tavares, they should worry about finding him some quality teammates.\n\u201cI have not put that much thought into it,\u201d Tavares said of the team\u2019s future in Brooklyn. \u201cI want to be honest with you. Just focused on this point in the season. We all want to know where we are playing and what the situation is, but a lot that stuff is rumours and reports. The organization has been great, not just with me but with all the players. That stuff does not change my thought process in wanting to be an Islander and hoping things work out.\u201d\nTAVARES HAD HUGE IMPACT ON MARNER\nJohn Tavares played less than a half a season for the London Knights. But the numbers he put up \u2014 32 goals and 50 points in 24 games \u2014 made a huge impact on Mitch Marner.\n\u201cHe was a great player,\u201d said Marner, who was 11 years old when Tavares was traded from Oshawa to London, and who also played for the Knights. \u201cIt was a thrill to watch him in the world juniors. Obviously, I knew about his stats in London and how big he was in London. He\u2019s been a great player since then. I kind of actually watched him a little growing up in the Toronto area. It\u2019s pretty cool now lining up against him.\u201d\nAlthough Tavares was an exceptional junior player, Marner actually put up comparable numbers last year in London, scoring 116 points in 57 games. Still, the Toronto Maple Leafs rookies \u2014 including Auston Matthews \u2014 were in awe of Tavares\u2019 offensive ability.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a special player,\u201d said Matthews. \u201cHe\u2019s one of those guys that comes around every so often. Obviously the things he\u2019s been able to do throughout his career \u2014 he\u2019s an unbelievable player.\u201d\nmtraikos@postmedia.com\ntwitter.com\/Michael_Traikos"}

The official wasn\u2019t authorized to speak publicly on the matter and spoke only on condition of anonymity ahead of a Thursday news conference that includes Washington\u2019s mayor and police chief.\nThe action is likely to exacerbate what has become a major irritant in U.S.-Turkish ties. Relations were severely strained even before the May 16 clash, which happened as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived at the Turkish ambassador\u2019s residence in Washington after a White House meeting with President Donald Trump.\nThe NATO allies are still at odds over a U.S. decision to arm Syrian Kurdish rebels fighting the Islamic State group in Syria. Turkey considers the fighters to be an extension the Kurdish insurgency in Turkey known as the PKK, and claims without evidence that protesters who showed up during Erdogan\u2019s visit to Washington last week were themselves associated with the group. U.S. officials have said law-abiding Americans were affected.\nErdogan\u2019s security detail returned with him to Turkey after his visit, so it is unclear if any will face legal repercussions in the United States. However, they could end up being threatened with arrest if they return to the U.S. If any are still in the country, they could be expelled if Turkey refuses to waive diplomatic immunity.\nVideo of the protest showed security guards and some Erdogan supporters attacking a small group of protesters with their fists and feet. Men in dark suits and others were recorded repeatedly kicking one woman as she lay curled on a sidewalk. Another wrenched a woman\u2019s neck and threw her to the ground. A man with a bullhorn was repeatedly kicked in the face.\nAfter police officers struggled to protect the protesters and ordered the men in suits to retreat, several of the men dodged the officers and ran into the park to continue the attacks. In all, nine people were hurt.\nEarlier Wednesday, police said two men were arrested for their role in the fracas.\nThe Metropolitan Police Department said in a brief statement that Sinan Narin had been arrested in Virginia on an aggravated assault charge. It said Eyup Yildirim had been arrested in New Jersey on charges of assault with significant bodily injury and aggravated assault.\nYildirim made his first appearance before Federal Magistrate James Clarke in Newark, N.J., who ordered him held without bail pending his next court date in Washington.\nPublic defender David Holman sought home confinement, arguing that Yildirim wasn\u2019t a flight risk and had never been convicted of anything before. Clarke said he was less concerned with him being a possible flight risk and more concerned about the nature of the crime.\nHolman told the judge that Yildirim has received death threats because of the case. He said Yildirim is a business owner with three kids and ties to the local community. Prosecutors told the judge Yildirim had been arrested twice in the late 90s on simple assault charges, but the charges were later dismissed.\nNarin and Yildirim were both participants in the protests, according to a U.S. official familiar with the case. On the day of the violence, police detained two members of Erdogan\u2019s security detail but released them shortly afterward. Two other men were arrested at the scene \u2014 one for aggravated assault and the other for assaulting a police officer.\nThe U.S. official, who was not authorized to speak publicly to the matter and demanded anonymity, said DC police had identified 34 of 42 people who were involved in the fight, and are seeking their arrests. Police are expected to release photos of the other eight possible suspects and appeal to the public for information on their identities, the official said.\nAmerican officials strongly criticized Turkey\u2019s government and Erdogan\u2019s security forces for the violence; the State Department summoned Turkey\u2019s U.S. ambassador to complain. The Turkish Foreign Ministry then summoned America\u2019s ambassador to address about the treatment of the detained security guards.\nTurkey\u2019s U.S. embassy alleged the demonstrators were associated with the PKK, which has waged a three-decade-long insurgency against Turkey and is considered a terrorist group by the United States.\nTurkey\u2019s official Anadolu news agency said they chanted anti-Erdogan slogans, and that the Turkish president\u2019s team moved in to disperse them because \u201cpolice did not heed to Turkish demands to intervene.\u201d The Turkish Embassy claimed the demonstrators were \u201caggressively provoking Turkish-American citizens who had peacefully assembled to greet the president.

But the alternatives are few, and each comes with daunting and combustible complications, including for Israel itself.\nThe idea of two states in the Holy Land \u2014 a Jewish Israel and an Arab Palestine \u2014 rests on a particular logic: There are two quite different peoples of roughly equal size living between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River; each wants their own nation-state to control and dominate numerically; each has shown tenacity toward this goal.\nThis would require Israel to let go of most and maybe all of the territory it captured in the 1967 war, when it completed its takeover of all the land that British colonizers abandoned in 1948. That includes the West Bank, where there are now islands of Palestinian autonomy, scattered Jewish settlements and overriding Israeli military control; the eastern part of Jerusalem, which Israel has fully annexed and populated with Jews; and the coastal Gaza Strip, which was actually evacuated in 2005 and is now blockaded and controlled by the Islamic militants of Hamas.\nOver the years many and probably most Israelis have come around to the idea of a partition largely because they want to be considered a democracy and do not want all the Palestinian future citizens that would come along with the territory. For almost two decades, U.S. policy has been to advocate a two-state solution.\nBut over two decades of peace talks have failed to produce agreement on the details, and many on both sides consider it impossible without a major change in circumstances \u2014 massive global pressure on Israel, more upheaval in the Arab neighborhoods, perhaps tectonic shifts in the prevailing world order.\nAhead of Wednesday's White House meeting between President Donald Trump and Netanyahu, a senior U.S. official suggested a two-state solution was optional, bringing condemnation from Palestinian officials. But many of them have for years been quietly preparing for an alternative strategy of a single bi-national state in the Holy Land.\nHere's a look at that option, and other scenarios that might arise:\nONE STATE\nFor years this was the goal of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and for many Palestinians it is indeed the preferred option: a single democratic state, not defined as specifically Jewish or Arab, in the area of British colonial Palestine. Many prefer it anyway to the two-state notion whereby even if Israel gives up all the land it captured in 1967 it retains almost 80% of Palestine.\nThe problem is that almost no one in Israel is arguing for the true extension of full rights to Palestinians in the currently occupied territories because even with Gaza excluded it would leave Arabs constituting close to half the country's population \u2014 and that is clearly the end of the Zionist dream of a Jewish state. This is why Israel has never annexed the West Bank and why the more sophisticated nationalists profess to support a partition, albeit on terms the Palestinians have not accepted and are not likely to.\nIf the Palestinians formally drop the two-state strategy and demand incorporation into Israel it will put Israel in the awkward position of refusing to annex territories where it has been settling Jews for decades. Down this path lie coercion efforts in the form of international sanctions on Israel, or Palestinian violence.\nINTERIM AGREEMENT\nMany Israelis have concluded that a final peace agreement with the Palestinians is simply not possible because the Palestinians are asking for the moon as a result of a feeling that they hold the demographic cards. It is not just about territory: the Palestinians still in theory demand a \"right of return\" to Israel proper for millions of descendants of Palestinian refugees living around the region and the world, which the vast majority of Jewish Israelis reject.\nBut perhaps a partial deal is possible whereby the Palestinians would not have to forego future claims but for now get their state on, say, 80% of the West Bank, with some sort of preferred access of new regime in the Old City of Jerusalem? Even the current nationalist Netanyahu government would probably accept such a thing, but the Palestinians have ruled it out, fearing the temporary would become permanent. To get them to agree would require massive global and Arab world pressure, and risks huge internal conflict among the Palestinians.\nJORDANIAN OPTION\nJordan took over the West Bank and east Jerusalem during the 1948-1949 Arab-Israel war that followed the British pullout, lost the areas to Israel in 1967 and then gave up all claims to them in favor of the Palestinians in the 1980s. But Jordan is a country with a majority Palestinian-descended population, and some Israelis still think that it can play a role in satisfying Palestinian national aspirations and resuming control over only a part of the West Bank.\nBut this would probably require a collapse of Hashemite rule, founded on Jordan's Bedouin population, and as such is anathema to the Jordanian monarchy, which is beloved by many israelis for making peace with them in 1994. Adding to the awkwardness, the Palestinians reject it altogether as well.\nPARTIAL UNILATERAL PULLOUT\nUnder these vexing circumstances many Israelis conclude no peace is possible, but they still want to be rid of the Palestinian population of the West Bank. In the mid-2000s the government of Ehud Olmert planned a unilateral pullout from most of the territory, to follow the 2005 withdrawal from Gaza. But those plans were upended when Gaza was taken over by Hamas militants and became a launching pad for rocket attacks on Israel, leading to several mini-wars.\nFew want to see that scenario repeated with the West Bank, which is much larger and closer to Israel's main cities. Now talk grows of a pullout of settlers from some areas, to create a more convincing reality of partition, while the military stays for now, pending some future arrangement. NATO? A global or Arab peacekeeping force? Perpetual Israeli control? No one can say.\nSTATUS QUO\nWhen the best that can be hoped for is the least bad solution, the status quo looks attractive to some. But Israel is constantly changing the landscape by adding settlers \u2014 already there are some 350,000 Israelis in the West Bank and a quarter million in East Jerusalem. And the Palestinians do not have a history of acquiescing for long: There were multi-year uprisings in the late 1980s and early 2000s and a spate of violence in late 2015 and early 2016. Down this path lies the very strong likelihood of more.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nDan Perry is AP's Middle East editor leading text coverage in the region."}

But now it seems that Zuma has chosen to use his retirement to reignite a plan to marry more regularly\u2026 In his first years in office, he married Thobeka Madiba and Gloria Ngema [below] until the ANC put a stop to it. At his wedding to Ngema, Zuma told his new bride, \u201cDon\u2019t close the door that you found open\u2026\u201d and he is clearly now free to exercise his options.\nA member of the ANC\u2019s former leadership told me that the women in the party had approached Zuma and told him that his polygamous lifestyle was accepted as a traditional right, but if the first family expanded annually it would impact on the party\u2019s identity as a modern organisation that supported gender rights. So, the president stopped the wedded bliss and reportedly left a Swazi princess, Sebentile Dlamini, stranded after he proposed to her family in 2002. But, unshackled from the chains of office, the former president is now free to be the lover he always was. \u2026to hear that Zuma\u2019s lover has won out over his fighter is the best possible news for Ramaphosa.\nFinally unshackled, it appears those oats are set to be sown.\nMaybe his new conquests will slow his political aims down, although it\u2019s obvious that being ousted by his own party has cut him deep.\nLet\u2019s just hope he eventually ends up behind bars, sans conjugal visits from outsiders.\n[source:huffpost]\nDo you have something awesome to share with the world?

(AP)\nWASHINGTON: French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday proposed a \"new deal\" to address President Donald Trump's many concerns about the existing nuclear pact with Iran.\nHere is a look at what may be in the works, and the challenges a new deal could entail.\nMacron's proposal\nIn a press conference at the White House, Macron said the 2015 Iran nuclear deal did not go far enough, while crediting it for allowing the international community \"some control\" over Iran's nuclear activities.\nOther areas still need addressing, he said, namely: Iran's nuclear activities after 2025 when so-called sunset clauses in the current deal kick in; Iran's ballistic missile activities; and a political means to limit Iran's activities in Yemen, Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon.\nIran is a key ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, supports Hezbollah militias in Lebanon and backs Yemen's Huthi rebels, who are locked in a war with a Saudi-led coalition.\n\"It's not about tearing apart an agreement and having nothing, but it's about building something new that will cover all of our concerns,\" Macron said.\nThe French president said France and its allies want \"sustainable stability,\" following months of Trump anger at the original Iran deal and threats to back out of it.\n\"I believe that the discussions we've had together make it possible to ... pave the way for a new agreement, an agreement on which we will work, and beyond our European partners, we would like to involve the regional powers, and of course, Russia and Turkey,\" he said.\nMacron indicated his suggestion was for a separate accord that would run alongside the current deal.\n\"I'm not saying that we move from one agreement to another,\" he said.\nThe proposal appears to repackage a solution previously floated by the Europeans to meet Trump's demands, by taking a tougher line on Iranian missile activity and Tehran's regional influence, but without ripping up the existing nuclear deal.\nWhat's at stake\nWith a hollowed-out State Department, even a transatlantic deal could prove an epic undertaking for the Trump administration, and Iran has already signalled that any talk of curbing its missile program is off limits.\nFurther, Trump has shown little appetite for international deal-making.\nThe existing nuclear deal was struck in 2015 after 21 months of grueling diplomacy.\nIn return for the lifting of punishing international sanctions, Iran froze its nuclear program, ending a 12-year standoff with the West, which worried it was developing a nuclear bomb.\nBritain, China, France, Russia, the United States and Germany signed off on the deal that, among other things, requires Iran to slash the amount of uranium it can enrich.\n- Trump's view -\nTrump has continually lambasted the accord signed by his predecessor Barack Obama, calling it at one point the \"worst deal ever.\"\nOn Tuesday, he described it as \"insane,\" and in October he refused to certify that Iran was respecting its commitments on the pact -- though he stopped short of walking away altogether.\nAt least on first blush, the US leader appeared receptive to trying to reach some sort of grand bargain.\n\"I think we will have a great shot at doing a much bigger, maybe, deal,\" said Trump, stressing that any new accord would have to be built on \"solid foundations.\"\n\"They should have made a deal that covered Yemen, that covered Syria, that covered other parts of the Middle East,\" said Trump.\nThe next decision deadline for Trump on the Iran deal is May 12.\n\"We're going to see what happens,\" he said."}

The smooth notes from his saxophone complimented the rhythmic groove of his mixer perfectly \u2014 even security guards became victim to the groove. SoDown\u2019s first time at Red Rocks has proven that it certainly will not be his last.\nManic Focus wasted no time hyping the crowd as they brought out a guest rapper and singer from Chicago. Calibrating sounds of classic hip-hop with heady jams and heavy bass which flowed with ease as they switched in and out songs fluidly. The sound of the violent solo followed by deep house go-go echoed on the rocks leaving rooted chills of excitement.\nDaily Bread kicked off night two. The Atlanta DJ and producer spent his debut Red Rocks performance accompanied by a full-time drummer and a separate part-time rapper. He mixed rock influenced dubstep and electronica with the occasional funk tracks and heavy bass lines. It was a good time for those who showed up early.\nG Jones was next up, spicing up the lighting and bumping the bass music. Grungy techno sounds were met with heavy drops and dubs. The lighting was simple but ever-evolving \u2014 black and white visions of construction sites, parking garages, psychedelic mannequins and more transitioned throughout the set. The set was good, but it would have been much better had the volume been louder. The show started out a bit quiet, seemingly increasing in volume about halfway through, but still not to the standards of some bassheads in attendance.\nBoth nights Pretty Lights gave humble words of excitement to his fans. He introduced the members of the band \u2014 as any gracious host would \u2014 and they gave mini solos, showing off their talented skills and joked with the young producer.

After a bit more time with these more movable beats and catchy samples, I realized he was working through the genres. He had just worked through funk, was now on hip-hop and verging \u201980s synths even. He stepped up the sampling even featuring Britney Spears\u2019 \u201cToxic\u201d and the synths of Eurythmics \u201cSweet Dreams.\u201d\nPretty Lights gave a special gift to all of his fans who couldn\u2019t be at the show at Red Rocks by live streaming both nights for free on Facebook, on top of releasing 16 new tracks this month.

The NPL is EPA\u2019s list of sites eligible for remedial action financed under the federal Superfund program. The meeting will be held on Tuesday, Feb. 13, at 6:30 p.m. at Hockessin Memorial Hall, 610 Yorklyn Road, Hockessin.\nIn 2002, DNREC took action to ensure that the public drinking water in the area \u2013 which is provided by the Artesian Water Company \u2013 is treated to remove contaminants and meets state and federal drinking water standards. Subsequently, DNREC requested additional assistance from EPA in 2016 to help fully investigate the area. The proposed listing will allow EPA to use Superfund authority and resources to work with DNREC to identify the sources of contamination and help resolve the groundwater concerns in the Hockessin area.\n\u201cSuperfund cleanup in our communities continues to be a priority at EPA as we work to create a safer and healthier environment,\u201d said EPA Mid-Atlantic Regional Administrator Cosmo Servidio. \u201cThis public hearing provides Hockessin-area residents a valuable opportunity to learn about the site and to provide comments on the proposed listing to the NPL.\u201d\n\u201cDelaware values the collaboration with EPA on investigating the Hockessin Groundwater Site,\u201d said DNREC Secretary Shawn M. Garvin. \u201cThe meeting on the proposed NPL listing offers reassurance to the Hockessin community that we will continue working together to identify the source for contaminants in the groundwater at the site.\u201d\nThe primary groundwater contaminant of concern in the Hockessin area is tetrachloroethylene (PCE), most commonly used as a dry-cleaning solvent and industrial degreaser. PCE, a Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) which can cause adverse human health effects, was identified in a commercial irrigation well, three residential wells, and several public supply wells in the Artesian Water Company\u2019s Hockessin well field. DNREC\u2019s previous actions included installing water treatment systems at the three residential properties impacted by the contamination.\nDNREC is working with several potentially responsible parties, and has completed numerous environmental investigations and remedial efforts at sites of potential concern to help determine the extent and potential source(s) of the contamination.\nEPA will discuss the proposed listing of the site to the NPL at the public meeting. Representatives from the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the Delaware Division of Public Health will join EPA and DNREC to answer health-related questions.\nEPA has opened a public comment period through March 19.

{"id":"986b67da-972d-4e99-bccd-79f1591dd6e9","text":"SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 President Donald Trump asserted on Sunday that China was working with the United States on \"the North Korea problem,\" and his vice president told American and South Korea service members that the North's latest \"provocation,\" a failed missile launch shortly before his arrival in Seoul, laid bare the risks they face.\nWhile the North did not conduct a nuclear test, the specter of a potential escalated U.S. response trailed Pence as he began a 10-day trip to Asia amid increasing tensions and heated rhetoric. Trump's national security adviser cited Trump's recent decision to order missile strikes in Syria after a chemical attack blamed on the Assad government as a sign that the president \"is clearly comfortable making tough decisions.\"\nBut at the same time, H.R. McMaster said, \"it's time for us to undertake all actions we can, short of a military option, to try to resolve this peacefully.\"\nIn a broadcast interview that aired on Sunday, McMaster said the U.S. would rely on its allies as well as on Chinese leadership to resolve the issues with North Korea. \"I mean, North Korea is very vulnerable to pressure from the Chinese,\" McMaster said on ABC's \"This Week.\"\nThe bottom line, McMaster said, is to stop the North's weapons development and make the Korean Peninsula nuclear-free: \"It's clear that the president is determined not to allow this kind of capability to threaten the United States. And our president will take action that is in the best interest of the American people.\"\nAfter a two-month policy review, officials settled on a policy dubbed \"maximum pressure and engagement,\" U.S. officials said Friday. The administration's immediate emphasis, the officials said, will be on increasing pressure on Pyongyang with the help of Beijing.\nThe officials weren't authorized to speak publicly on the results of the policy review and requested anonymity.\nPence will be tasked with explaining the policy in meetings with leaders in South Korea and Japan at the start of his trip, which will also include stops in Indonesia and Australia. He will also aim to reassure allies in South Korea and Japan that the U.S. will take appropriate steps to defend them against North Korean aggression.\nPence was aboard Air Force Two flying over the Bering Sea when a North Korean missile exploded during launch on Sunday, U.S. and South Korean officials said. The high-profile failure came as the North tried to showcase its nuclear and missile capabilities around the birth anniversary of the North's late founder and as a U.S. aircraft carrier neared the Korean Peninsula.\nA White House foreign policy adviser traveling with Pence said no U.S. response to the missile launch was expected because there was no need for the U.S. to reinforce the failure. The adviser spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the administration's initial understanding of the launch.\nTrump, spending the Easter weekend at his Florida resort, reinforced his commitment to the armed forces under his control. \"Our military is building and is rapidly becoming stronger than ever before,\" he tweeted.\nMore directly on North Korea, the president returned to a theme of placing much onus on China for reining in the North. Last week, he said he would not declare China a currency manipulator, pulling back from a campaign promise, as he looks for help from Beijing, which is the North's dominant trade partner.\n\"Why would I call China a currency manipulator when they are working with us on the North Korean problem? We will see what happens!\" Trump tweeted on Sunday.\nDeputy national adviser K.T. McFarland briefed the president on the failed missile launch. She advised patience with China on the issue.\n\"North Korea is a liability to everybody and it's a threat not just to the United States, not just to South Korea, not just to Japan, not just to Russia, but it's actually a threat to China as well,\" McFarland said Sunday on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\nInto this tense environment, Pence made his first trip to the region since taking office in January. After arriving in the South Korean capital, he placed a wreath at Seoul National Cemetery and then worshipped with military personnel at an Easter church service at the U.S. Army Garrison Yongsan.\nDuring a fellowship meal after the services, he said the tensions on the Korean peninsula had put into sharp focus the importance of the joint U.S.-South Korean mission.\n\"This morning's provocation from the North is just the latest reminder of the risks each one of you face every day in the defense of the freedom of the people of South Korea and the defense of America in this part of the world,\" said Pence. \"Your willingness to step forward, to serve, to stand firm without fear, inspires the nation and inspires the world.\"\nAlong with the deployment of the U.S. aircraft carrier and other vessels into waters off the Korean Peninsula, thousands of U.S. and South Korean troops, tanks and other weaponry were deployed last month in their biggest joint military exercises. That led North Korea to issue routine threats of attacks on its rivals if they show signs of aggression.\nThe White House foreign policy adviser traveling with Pence told reporters that the type of missile that North Korea tried to fire on Sunday was medium-range, and that it exploded about 4 to 5 seconds after it was launched.\nThe North regularly launches short-range missiles, but is also developing mid-range and long-range missiles meant to target U.S. troops in Asia and, eventually, the U.S. mainland.\nThe failed launch will sting in Pyongyang because it came a day after one of the biggest North Korean propaganda events of the year\u2014 celebrations of the 105th birthday of late North Korea founder Kim Il Sung, the current leader's grandfather.\nAccording to the White House adviser, the test had been expected and the U.S. had good intelligence both before and after the launch. The official said, without elaborating, that had it been a nuclear test, \"other actions would have been taken by the U.S.\"\nNorth Korea has conducted five nuclear tests, including two last year. Recent satellite imagery suggests the country could conduct another underground nuclear test at any time.\nFollow Ken Thomas on Twitter at https:\/\/twitter.com\/KThomasDC"}

President Tayyip Erdogan accused the body of treason.\nMore than 300 people have been detained over social media posts that \u201ccriticised, opposed or misrepresented\u201d the Afrin campaign, which started nearly two weeks ago, the government has said.\nAmong the 13 people targeted by the latest detention warrants was the gay rights activist Ali Erol, who had tweeted \u201cWar is a public health problem. #WeStandWithTTB\u201d, his organisation said. Another person was detained after tweeting \u201cWar is death, destruction, blood and tears. #NoToWar\u201d, other local media reported.\nAuthorities also raided the residence of a lawyer who had publicly read the statement from the medical association, a lawmaker from the main opposition said.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to let anyone breathe,\u201d Baris Yarkadas, of the Republican People\u2019s Party (CHP), said on Twitter.\nThe crackdown on some of Turkey\u2019s top doctors has drawn international criticism from rights group Amnesty International and the World Medical Association, which has called for their protection and an immediate end to the legal proceedings.\nErdogan\u2019s critics see the latest arrests as emblematic of the purge that has followed a failed 2016 coup. More than 50,000 people have been arrested and 150,000 sacked or suspended from their jobs, moves the government says are necessary given the multiple security threats Turkey faces.\nRights groups and some of Turkey\u2019s Western allies fear Erdogan is using the crackdown to stifle dissent and crush his opponents. Freedom House, a Washington-based watchdog, downgraded Turkey to \u201cnot free\u201d from \u201cpartly free\u201d in an annual report last month.\nTurkey launched its Afrin operation, dubbed \u201cOperation Olive Branch\u201d, nearly two weeks ago to target Kurdish YPG fighters near its southern border. Turkey sees the militia as a terrorist group and an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).\nSeparately, authorities on Thursday ordered the detention of another 13 people in three provinces for protesting against the offensive, police said.

This advances scientists' understanding of how climate change affects land and ocean regions differently.\nPredicting changes in temperature and humidity over landmasses is difficult, because there are many different local factors affecting them and large-scale estimates rely on limited local weather stations. Over the ocean, however, surface temperature can be more easily measured with satellites and humidity is more closely controlled by temperature.\nThe new model, published today in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, uses a simple relationship between the humidity and temperature over ocean and land, and how energy and water vapour are transferred between them.\nLead author Dr. Michael Byrne, from the Department of Physics at Imperial, said: \"Heat and humidity are important factors when considering the impacts of climate change. For example, heat stress can damage whole ecosystems.\n\"Together with data from satellites and weather stations, this model can help to explain how land temperature and humidity have changed over the last 38 years for large areas of the globe.\"\nExchanging energy\nThe atmosphere directly above both the land and ocean has the same change in amount of energy as the climate warms. This energy is divided between the temperature and the specific humidity (the amount of water held in the air). Over the ocean, air is moist, meaning more of this energy is represented by the humidity of the atmosphere.\nOver land, less water enters the atmosphere, so the humidity is less. In order for the change in energy of the atmosphere over land to match that over the ocean, the land has to put more energy into temperature increases. Therefore, the land warms faster than the ocean, but in a way that is proportional to the rise in humidity over the ocean.\nIn order to estimate warming over land using this principle, the team also had to take into account the exchange of energy as moisture moves from the ocean to the land. By comparing their model with historical data, they found they could predict continental temperatures well using ocean temperatures.\nFundamental relationship\nDr. Byrne said: \"Modelling land temperature changes has been a challenge for scientists trying to understand climate change, because there are so many variables, like vegetation cover or topography.\n\"But what we have uncovered is a fundamental relationship between ocean and land, which doesn't rely on these smaller-scale factors that may be poorly understood.\"\nExplore further: Study reveals potential stability of ocean processes despite climate change\nMore information: Michael P.

That, however, is just what happened to an American Airlines flight last weekend, when 10 people were injured as the plane plowed through turbulence on its way to landing in Philadelphia.\nA rundown of statistics, recent incidents, and what pilots and airlines do to avoid hitting potholes in the sky:\nTHE NUMBERS\nAbout 40 people a year are seriously injured by turbulence in the U.S., according to Federal Aviation Administration figures from the last 10 years. The FAA counted 44 injuries last year, the most since more than 100 were hurt in 2009.\nBut the official count is almost certainly too low.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board requires airlines to report incidents that result in serious injury or death, and FAA uses those reports to tally the number of people hurt by turbulence. But airlines are not required to report injuries unless they require a 48-hour hospital stay or involve certain specific injuries such as major broken bones, burns or organ damage.\nSaturday's American Airlines flight to Philadelphia likely won't meet those standards \u2014 the injured people were released from the hospital within a few hours and didn't suffer the types of injuries that trigger a report to the federal safety board.\nRECENT FLIGHTS\nThe American Airlines flight from Athens hit severe turbulence over the New York coastline. Seven crew members and three passengers among the 299 people on board were taken to a hospital for treatment. American Airlines spokesman Ross Feinstein said the seat-belt sign was on but none of the injured people were buckled in.\nFeinstein said the plane was inspected and suffered no damage. After the interior was cleaned up \u2014 coffee and other drinks went flying, even splashing the ceiling \u2014 the plane was put back in service Monday, he said.\nIt was the latest in a string of scary turbulence incidents.\n\u2014 In June, 10 people on a United Airlines flight from Panama City to Houston were injured when their plane was shaken over the Gulf of Mexico.\n\u2014 In May, more than two dozen passengers suffered injuries including broken bones when they were tossed around the cabin of an Aeroflot plane headed from Moscow to Bangkok.\n\u2014 More than 20 people were injured in August 2016 when a JetBlue plane ran into turbulence in a line of thunderstorms over South Dakota and had to make an emergency landing.\nRATING TURBULENCE\nTurbulence is classified as light, moderate, severe or extreme. The first two might be frightening to some passengers, but it is only the latter two that are dangerous, especially for passengers and crew who aren't buckled in.\nMost people associate turbulence with heavy storms. The most dangerous type, however, is so-called clear-air turbulence \u2014 a wind-shear phenomenon that can occur in wispy cirrus clouds or even clear air near thunderstorms, as differences in temperature and pressure create powerful currents of fast-moving air."}

Picture: iStock\nWE all know someone who can clear a room with one tiny fart.\nSome might be proud of their efforts - yes, we are looking at boys - others feel awkward and embarrassed while trying to pin it on the dog.\nPopping off is a perfectly natural way for your body to pass excess gas produced during the day - in other words, you can't stop it.\nAnd it happens between five and 15 times a day.\nNot all farts smell, in fact some of them have no odour at all and don't even make a noise when they pass.\nOthers are so pungent people are reaching for something to cover their nose.\nSo what makes them smell so awful?\nIt all comes down to what you eat and the gases it makes your body produce - and what you've heard about baked beans isn't wrong.\nFoods that make your farts stink\nUndigested carbs are the most common reason passing wind smells so bad.\nYour stomach struggles to break down certain foods as they move through the bowel.\nSugars like fructose and sorbitol, found in some fruits and artificial sweeteners are one of the main culprits.\nOther fart-inducing fiends include soluble fibre found in beans, nuts and fruit; insoluble fibre found in root vegetables and wheat bran; and starches found in corn, wheat and potatoes.\nFoods that make one person gassy don't necessarily make another person fart, according to the International Foundation for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders (IFFGD).\nHere's what could be causing you to pop off.\n1. Beans\nBeans and other foods like asparagus, broccoli, Brussels sprouts and cabbage contain raffinose.\nHumans lack the ability to digest raffinose, so when our gut tries to it creates excess gas.\n2. Beer\nBeer is high in sulphur - a chemical that naturally has quite a pungent smell.\nMix that in your stomach and, well, you can guess the rest.\nOther foods that are high in sulphur include broccoli, garlic, onions, cauliflower and wine (sorry ladies).\n3. Processed foods\nNot so much a specific food as more of a food group, but it does make you gassy.\nProcessed foods are often high in sugar alcohol, which create gas because the body can't digest them properly.\nWhen is farting a sign of something serious?\nThere's no point hiding it, we all fart.\nBut there are times when fluffing goes beyond the expected amount and could be a sign of something serious.\n1. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\nIBS can be agonising, causing frequent tummy discomfort, bloating, constipation as well as bouts of diarrhoea.\nAnother symptom of IBS is frequent gas.\nIBS can also lead to other complications such as a lack of energy, feeling sick or nauseous, pain during sex and social anxiety and depression.\nSo if you think you might have the condition speak to a GP.\n2. Bowel cancer\nBowel cancer, also known as colon cancer or colorectal cancer, is the second most common form of the disease in the Australia..\nThe key red flag signs for the disease include blood in your poo, tummy pain, bloating and a change in bowel movements.\nA side effect your bowel movements changing can be gas, so if you are farting a lot and notice other symptoms speak to a GP.\n3. Coeliac disease\nCoeliac disease is an autoimmune digestive condition where the intestines react to gluten and become inflamed.\nThe adverse reaction can come from the dietary protein which is often found in three cereals: wheat, barley and rye.\nThe gluten damages the lining of the intestines making the body unable to absorb important nutrients.\nCoeliac disease is a life-long condition that can lead to bloating, nausea, excess gas and tiredness, and is only treated by a change in diet.\n4. Lactose intolerance\nSome people lack an enzyme that allows them to digest lactose found in dairy products.\nFor these people, drinking milk or eating something like cheese can cause severe tummy upset, diarrhoea, bloating and gas.\nIf you frequently experience these symptoms after eating dairy you should speak to a GP.\nThis story originally appeared on The Sun and has been republished with permission."}

In my view, Kasai already today bears the signature of Rwanda and Bosnia in the early 1990s,\u201d Melzer told Reuters.\nCongo\u2019s army and allied Bana Mura militia opposed the Kamuina Nsapu militia in a partially ethnic conflict that erupted in 2016 and still simmers. It was one of a series of flare-ups to hit Congo around the time President Joseph Kabila refused to leave power when his mandate expired at the end of 2016.\nRwanda\u2019s 1994 genocide saw 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus killed in 100 days by the Hutu-led government and ethnic militias. The United Nations and major powers failed to halt the slaughter, despite cables from the field that it was looming.\nSome 8,000 Muslim men and boys were massacred by Bosnian Serb troops under the command of former General Ratko Mladic at Srebrenica, a U.N.-designated \u201csafe haven\u201d, in July 1995, the worst mass killing on European soil since World War Two.\n\u201cToday Kasai is a hell that is just about to break loose,\u201d said Melzer, a Swiss international lawyer serving in the independent U.N. post.\n\u201cOur experts have delivered the evidence and it is now up to the world leaders to get their act together and prevent the next genocide, the next exodus of millions to all corners of the world and the next unforgivable tragedy in human history.\u201d\nMajor powers on the U.N. Security Council failed to heed warnings to halt ethnic violence in Rwanda or Bosnia but years later set up international tribunals to prosecute perpetrators.\nAt least 5,000 people have been killed in the Kasai region over the past two years and more than 1.4 million displaced, while \u201conly a few low-level criminal suspects have been prosecuted\u201d, Human Rights Watch said on Tuesday.\n\u201cThe risks of further violence, abuse, and repression in the coming months are very real, with potentially devastating consequences throughout the region,\u201d Laila Matar of the New York-based group told the U.N. Human Rights Council."}

This season is a fresh start for us with the change of management so there\u2019s no looking back.\u201d\nStill, McFadden acknowledged that critics were quick to stick the knife in and slam Donegal\u2019s counter attacking style after the whitewash.\n(Image: \u00a9INPHO\/Tommy Dickson)\nHe said: \u201cI suppose the way it ended, people want to hit out at you when you are down and want to point out what you\u2019re doing wrong.\n\u201cBut it is always easy to be negative towards a pragmatist.\n\u201cWe had great attacking performances against Tyrone and in the first-half against Mayo, while we also put up big scores against Monaghan and Roscommon.\n\u201cWe also put up a decent number against Antrim in the Ulster Championship and against Meath.\n\u201cSo we have shown that we are capable of putting up big scores but the reality is that if we are facing a Cavan, a Tyrone or a Monaghan in Ulster, the game is not going to be that open.\nRead Also: Exclusive: Dublin football add Paul Clarke to management team as a selector\n\u201cThat\u2019s just the reality of Ulster football and you have to prepare yourself to be very competitive in those games.\n\u201cUnfortunately last year we just weren\u2019t competitive against Tyrone but I don\u2019t think that had anything to do with the fact that we were too defensive, we just simply weren\u2019t at the races and we won\u2019t hide from that.\u201d\nMcFadden, who had soccer stints with Finn Harps and Sligo Rovers, is optimistic under new boss Bonner who has worked with many of the Donegal players already at minor and U-21 level.\nMcFadden said: \u201cIn terms of our game plan, we\u2019ve had a defensive structure but there were parts of it which were not working so we need to see if we can get our forwards on the ball a bit more and get more players up the field at times.

It didn\u2019t seem that way.\n\u201cRegan wasn\u2019t wholly responsible. Questions should be asked about the board and their ability to carry on. Regan has been in his job for eight years and they kept him in his job.\n\u201cNow he\u2019s gone and they are still surviving. The manager situation was clearly his downfall and it wasn\u2019t helped with these friendlies against Mexico and Peru in the summer.\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t just about Celtic in Europe.

The words that flash across the bottom are both awful and familiar.\nOnce I board the plane, a sense of numbness takes over. I know what is coming.\nThere will be a focus on the shooter and his motivations. There will be a list of those who are never coming back. There will be terrible injuries, wounds that take years to heal. There will be tales of courage, near escapes, lives spared by chance. There will be a visit by the country's President. There will be vigils, with candles lit against the darkness.\nStory continues below advertisement\nI know \"Vegas Strong\" will be the city's slogan. There will be public gratitude for police officers and paramedics, trauma surgeons and nurses. Strangers from other parts of the country, seeking to help, will send pizzas to law enforcement or bottled water to hospitals.\nI know all this before I land. After arriving, I head to the hospital. Sheryl Terrill is going inside to see her daughter Kristina Staples. Ms. Terrill is shaky, her words coming out in a rush. Ms. Staples was at the Route 91 music festival on Sunday night with her husband. The mother of a 16-month-old, she has been shot in the head and is in a coma. It is unclear whether she will wake up.\n\"I know where she is and I know she's alive,\" her mother says. \"I hold on to that.\"\nThis is the first night of covering the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history, which killed 58 people and injured close to 500. It forms part of a grim pattern: In the past decade, there have been 40 shootings in the United States where a gunman killed four or more people in a public place.\nFor me, going to Las Vegas is the worst kind of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In December, 2012, I was in Newtown, Conn., to write about the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School where 26 people were killed, including 20 first graders. In June of last year, I was in Orlando, standing outside another hospital after a shooter killed 49 people at Pulse, a gay nightclub.\nEach time, I hoped that I would never write about another such event again. Each time I was wrong. Now, I have come to Las Vegas with a different kind of question: Has the United States accepted these shootings as a way of life?\nDec. 18, 2012: Girls light candles at a memorial in Newtown, Conn., set up to honour the victims of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. ERIC THAYER\/REUTERS\nDec. 28, 2012: A flag in Newtown bears the names of the dead.

Before this week\u2019s Las Vegas attack, Pulse was the deadliest U.S. shooting in recent history. Joshua Lim\/Orlando Sentinel via AP\n'The sky is crying'\nI remember sitting at my desk in New York overlooking Times Square and getting a call from my editor on Dec. 14, 2012. What we had thought was an \"ordinary\" school shooting in Connecticut earlier that morning had turned into a massacre. I jumped in a car, heading north, feeling a combination of dread and nerves.\nStory continues below advertisement\nEven now, it is the worst event I have ever covered. A local nurse told me she had rushed to the school to assist with the wounded only to find there was no one to help. A mother could not stop weeping as she described the twist of fate that had kept her own first grader home from school that day.\nSix days later, under a cold rain, Veronique Pozner eulogized her six-year-old son Noah with words that are still with me. \"The sky is crying, and the flags are at half-mast,\" she said. \"It is a sad, sad day. But it is also your day, Noah, my little man.\"\nVeronique Pozner waves to the media after a funeral service for her son, Noah, on Dec. 17, 2012. KEVIN VAN PAASSEN\/THE GLOBE AND MAIL\nAfter Newtown, there was a sense that something had to \u2013 and could \u2013 change. Several new groups were founded to push for tighter restrictions on guns and better resources for mental health. President Barack Obama tried to enact a requirement for universal background checks on commercial gun sales, a measure that polls show is supported by a majority of Americans. Lawmakers also tried to limit the sale of high-capacity magazines. Opposed by the National Rifle Association and other gun rights groups, the measures failed in the Senate four months after the Newtown shooting.\nThis too became a grim pattern. In the years since Newtown, members of Congress have rejected gun-control measures put forward after other mass shootings, including efforts to once again expand background checks and to allow the federal Centers for Disease Control to conduct research on gun violence. After the shooting in Orlando last year, carried out by an American professing allegiance to the Islamic State, Republican legislators even blocked an attempt to ban gun sales to individuals on the federal terrorist watch list.\n\"There is a Groundhog Day feel to these mass shootings and the political response,\" says Kristin Goss, a professor of public policy at Duke University who has written two books on the debate over guns in the United States. \"Guns have become a central component of a political identity \u2026 [and] it's harder to negotiate over something that's very central to your identity.\"\n(This week, a small opening has appeared: Several senior Republicans and the NRA have signalled their openness to banning \"bump stocks,\" the accessories that allowed the Las Vegas shooter to fire an automatic, military-style stream of bullets into the crowd of concert-goers.)\nStory continues below advertisement\nIn Las Vegas, again and again, the acts of ordinary people \u2013 who tend to the wounded and dying, open their homes, donate blood and volunteer their time \u2013 show the best aspects of humanity. But amid the outpouring of individual generosity, there is also a sense of futility and resignation. People reach out to help the victims, yet feel helpless to tackle the larger problem: that the United States is the only developed country where this type of violence happens with regularity.\nTerri Porter, 69, who is herself undergoing chemotherapy, has visited to three local hospitals to offer free rides to relatives and friends of the victims. But she is pessimistic that any policies will change in the wake of the attack. \"You feel so powerless,\" she says. \"It will take \u2013 I don't know. You just hope you get leaders with some courage.\"\nOn Tuesday night in Las Vegas, I went to a prayer vigil at Christ Church Episcopal, a whitewashed church with a tile roof and an enclosed courtyard. Bishop Dan Edwards, who heads the Episcopal diocese of Nevada, warns those gathered in the pews under whirring fans that he is not going to offer a comforting sermon.\nFor Bishop Edwards, it is a particularly dispiriting moment. In 1966, he was a teenager visiting his brother at the University of Texas Austin when a shooter began firing from the tallest building on campus, killing 14 people. It is considered the first modern mass shooting in the United States and the Las Vegas attack carried its echoes \u2013 both perpetrators unleashed terror from on high and far away.\n\"There's something surreal about having been there for the first mass shooting and now being here in Las Vegas for the biggest one,\" he says. I ask the bishop what has been achieved in the intervening 51 years. \"Clearly, not enough,\" he says.\nOn Tuesday night, he stood before a sombre crowd at the church and delivered a message. \"What is the purpose of 100-round magazine clips, semi-automatic weapons, and bump stocks that make a rifle shoot like a machine gun?\" he asks. \"We enact into law our veneration of violence.\"\nLas Vegas survivors William King and his wife, Kimberly King, sit in their home after returning from the hospital, where Mr. King was treated for a gunshot wound to the chest. Emily Wilson for the Globe and Mail\nMr. King threw himself on top of his wife to shield her, and was shot by a bullet that passed through his chest, narrowly missing his aorta. COURTESY OF KIMBERLY KING\nA sense of helplessness\nOne morning, I arrive at the cardiology ward on the fifth floor of Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center to talk to William King, who was shot in the chest at Sunday's concert. He is sitting on a hospital bed, the entrance and exit wounds on his left side covered with square bandages. I ask him how he is holding up.\nHe begins to cry. \"I'm all over the place,\" he says. \"I'm sad, I'm mad. I wish I hadn't seen the things I saw.\"\nDoctors say Mr. King's luck was extraordinary: The bullet passed through his left side from back to front, narrowly missing his aorta. He was hit after he threw himself on top of his wife, Kimberly, trying to shield her as they lay on the ground amid a barrage of gunfire.\nWith Mr. King holding his wound with one hand and his wife with the other, the couple began to run. Ms. King remembers trying to scream for help but no sound emerging. Next to her, she saw a woman fall down lifeless, shot in the face.\nThey made it to a loading area of a nearby casino and Mr. King, 38, wondered whether he was going to die. \"Is this light going to show up? Is this going to happen?\" he recalls thinking. With the help of strangers \u2013 an off-duty doctor, a security guard and a Lyft driver \u2013 he made it to the hospital.\nMs. King, 26, says she can't shake a sense of fear. Her voice catches as she describes seeing a police officer at the concert, helpless to protect people from the hail of bullets. For the first time in her life, Ms. King wants to buy a gun. It would not have helped on Sunday night, she knows, but next time, she thinks it might. \"When you are without a gun and there's a shooter, there's this sense of helplessness,\" she says.\nOur conversation takes me back to the people I spoke to in Orlando last year. They described a tumble into vulnerability and a sense of seeing threats everywhere. A woman whose daughter used to go to Pulse nightclub talked to me about having a panic attack in a restaurant, imagining a gunman might come in and start shooting. A bank teller told me that her adrenalin had surged when an odd customer suddenly grew agitated: Was he a potential shooter?\nA special awfulness\nEach time a shooting such as this happens, a different place is traumatized. And each time, there is a spot where families gather to hear whether this day will be the worst one in their lives. In Las Vegas, it is a corner of the city's Convention Center. In Orlando, it was a seniors centre blocks from the main hospital. In Newtown, it was a firehouse just down the road from Sandy Hook Elementary School.\nI remember sitting in crab grass across from the seniors centre in Orlando less than 24 hours after the rampage and seeing the parents of one of the victims emerge with a group of relatives. The mother could not walk for weeping. The father stopped after a few steps and bent over, bracing his hands on his knees, unable to continue.\nAt the time, the number of lives lost in the Orlando shooting was unfathomable. When the city held a vigil for those killed, a bell tolled once for each of the 49 victims. It felt endless. But a little more than a year later, the carnage in Las Vegas has surpassed that tally \u2013 and included four Canadians.\nThe fact that Las Vegas is a place where people come for fun is its own special awfulness. Its famous Strip is subdued for a day, but quickly returns to something resembling normality. The large screens outside the hotels display messages of condolences and support. But the slot machines still flash and whir and travellers from all over the world are here with something to celebrate. Down the street from my hotel, there is a gun range with a billboard advertising the chance to \"shoot a real machine gun.\" Its parking lot is full.\nThe country, too, is moving on.

USA TODAY Sports \/ Jayne Kamin-Oncea\nWorld No. 1 Roger Federer lavished praise on long-time nemesis Juan Martin del Potro after their hard-fought battle during Sunday's Indian Wells final. After capturing the 2018 Australian Open, Federer claimed his career 97th ATP Tour victory at Netherlands last month, to make his best-ever start to a new season.\nBut the Swiss Master's momentum was ended by del Potro, who became the first Argentine to win a top-tier Masters series event.\nDel Potro, who defeated Federer in last year's US Open semi-final, saved three match points in the deciding set before the Swiss legend struggled to serve out.\n\"I'm so happy to win a title like this. I lost many finals in Masters 1000s but today was the day for me. I played unbelievable tennis, almost three hours, and beating Roger for the first time this year, that means a lot to me,\" said Del Potro, before dedicating his first ATP Masters 1000 title to his beloved dog Cesar, who recently passed away.\n\"I cannot believe this moment. I always think about what I did in the past, trying to fix my wrist problems. I did, I'm playing tennis again and winning titles so I have a lot of things to celebrate and this trophy is one of them,\" added del Potro after winning the 2018 BNP Paribas Open.\nWhile expressing frustration at his inability to capitalise on key moments, Federer praised del Potro for holding his nerves and getting to finish line.\n\"I feel frustrated, you know, that I let an opportunity like this go by. (Having said that), Juan Martin well played today. It was a tough match, but well done you deserve it. There was not much between us, but you deserved it. Well done and enjoy the moment,\" Federer said during the post-tournament presentation ceremony.\nAfter the Indian Wells event, Roger Federer will now shift his attention to the 2018 Miami Open at Key Biscayne, Florida, United States. A year ago, Federer pulled off the 'Sunshine Double' in Florida by claiming both the Indian Wells and the Miami Open titles. With Rafael Nadal set to miss the Key Biscayne event, Federer is expected to stay as the World No. 1 for the foreseeable future."}

Vanderbilt (6-17, 2-7) is finishing out the final month of a frustrating season.\nOn the court this season, they are incomparable rivals who will face off at 1 p.m. CT Sunday (ESPNU) at Memorial Gym. But on the recruiting trail, the gap is not as wide.\nMore: Vanderbilt coaches Bryce Drew, Stephanie White have similar mistakes, challenges, slam-dunk recruits\nIn ESPN\u2019s 2018 recruiting class rankings, UT is No. 6 and Vanderbilt is No. 20.\nAnd what\u2019s the most noticeable characteristic of the Commodores\u2019 pair of five-star signees? They are both from Tennessee, a state that hasn\u2019t always sent its best players to Vanderbilt.\n\u201cWe\u2019d love to keep those types of kids in state and at Vanderbilt,\u201d second-year Vanderbilt coach Stephanie White said. \u201cWe want to compete with Tennessee in that way. But from an academic perspective in getting the best players, we want to compete with Duke and Stanford and Notre Dame, as well.\u201d\nVanderbilt got two of state\u2019s best\nStriking the right balance in recruiting has always been a challenge for Vanderbilt women\u2019s basketball.\nTennessee is often rich with talent in girls high school basketball. According to ESPN, eight of the top 100 players in the 2018 class are from Tennessee, second only to Texas (11). But UT, other SEC schools and even UConn compete for the best players in Tennessee.\nWhite signed two of the best from this year\u2019s crop of in-state recruits in Ensworth point guard Jordyn Cambridge, ranked the No. 23 player in the 2018 class by ESPN, and Riverdale guard Brinae Alexander, ranked No. 51.\nMore: Vanderbilt women\u2019s basketball signs players from Ensworth, Riverdale\nUT recruited both Vanderbilt signees earlier in the process. But the Lady Vols instead signed one other in-state player, Hamilton Heights Christian Academy point guard Jazmine Massengill. Georgia Tech also landed two top-100 players from Tennessee. Kentucky, Alabama and Western Kentucky signed one each.\nVanderbilt must cast wide recruiting net\nBut Tennessee is not overflowing with five-star prospects every year. Only one Tennessee high school player is on ESPN\u2019s top-60 list in the 2019 class.\nAnd Vanderbilt isn\u2019t guaranteed to get an in-state player every year, especially with its high academic standards eliminating some potential prospects.\nCoach Jim Foster knows that balancing act quite well. He led the Commodores to a Final Four and five Elite Eights from 1991-2002, usually with players from every region of the country and a few home-grown Tennessee players sprinkled in.\nMore: What\u2019s wrong with Vanderbilt women\u2019s basketball?\n\u201cYou can never depend on just one area for recruiting. A state is very fertile one year, but not the next \u2014 even this state,\u201d said Foster, now the coach at Chattanooga. \u201cOur best teams back then tended to be a mix and match of players from all over the country intertwined with a few Tennessee kids.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no magic potion, and every situation is different. Vanderbilt has a lot to offer. When you recruit a wide range, you\u2019ll find good players that want to play there.\u201d\nWhite adjusting to recruiting\nBefore coming to Vanderbilt last season, White spent a decade coaching in the WNBA. During that period, she said she \u201cgot a little bit detached from high school basketball and where these recruits were coming from.\u201d\nBut White\u2019s recruiting strategy will be a major factor in whether she can rebuild the program. Her staff must take advantage of Vanderbilt\u2019s location in a talent-rich state, but also sell the Commodores\u2019 brand nationally.\nMore: Vanderbilt women\u2019s basketball coach Stephanie White wants \u2018less robotic\u2019 players\n\u201cAnd they have to fit in athletically (in White\u2019s up-tempo style) and be up for the challenge academically, and the two we have coming in definitely fit,\u201d White said. \u201cThey have to see where we are going with the program. They have to understand our vision to come here. These two definitely do.\u201d\nNow the task for White will be finding such players every year \u2014 whether in state or out \u2014 to rebuild the Commodores and compete with the Lady Vols.\nReach Adam Sparks at asparks@tennessean.com and on Twitter @AdamSparks.\nWHERE TENNESSEE\u2019S TOP PROSPECTS SIGNED\n(Includes players in ESPN\u2019s Top 100 of 2018 class)\nRank, Player (High School), College\n21.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email\nWith immaculate timing, shortly before Wasps launch their 2017\/18 season with a friendly in Ulster on Thursday evening, the man who provides a current connection between the two clubs sprung into the headlines.\nKiwi utility back Charles Piutau spent an outstanding season at the Ricoh, prior to moving 12 months ago in a pre-planned transfer to the Kingspan.\nDuring that 24 month period, he became a fans favourite at both clubs through his powerful running, brilliant footballing skills and ability to provide that indefinable X-factor.\nIndeed, such was the impact he made on both the Premiership and Pro 12, that until last week his name was at the top of every ambitious club\u2019s shopping list.\nPiutau\u2019s contract with his Belfast-based employers ends in May, after which the 25-year-old was widely expected to return to the land of the long white cloud and stake his claim for a Japan 2019 All Black shirt.\nHowever, every head of recruitment from Canterbury to Cardiff and Toulon to Twickenham also had Piutau\u2019s agent\u2019s number on speed-dial, until we eventually discovered that the seemingly bottomless pockets of Bristol owner Stephen Lansdown had clinched what might just be the most sought after signature in European rugby.\nWhile Ulster fans\u2019 dismay at the loss of their star player was entirely predictable, the social media reaction of the black-and-gold faithful was only marginally less distraught.\nThis was fuelled from a sense of unfinished business generated by Piutau\u2019s stellar 2015\/16 season with Wasps, and Dai Young\u2019s admission in May that: \u201cIf he did decide he wanted to stay in this neck of the woods, then we would certainly be one team interested in giving him an option.\u201d\nWasps boss went on to confirm just how big an impression the Tongan-descended ace had made.\n\u201cHis ability on the field was plain for anyone to see, but also his professionalism off the field was outstanding,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHe was a leader and he\u2019s still a young man who is so valuable to a squad since he\u2019s an international full-back, an international winger and an international centre.\n\u201cPeople doubted what impact he could make in a year and we and we all saw how important he was to the team.\n\u201cWe would love to have him back here. We made that pretty clear to him when he left and we\u2019ll certainly make that clear to him again.\u201d\nAlthough Wasps determined in April that they would not replace Kurtley Beale with another big name marquee signing unless, as Young put it: \u201ca player we\u2019d be silly not to consider becomes available,\u201d Piutau surely fell squarely in this category.\n(Image: Richard Lane Photography)\nSo it therefore seems reasonable to assume that the black-and-golds were unwilling to match the \u00a31 million per annum which the Kiwi reportedly will receive from Bristol, which positions him as comfortably the Premiership\u2019s highest-ever earner.\nThis development also therefore marks the end of a two-year silly season in which every rugby club - including Toulon\u2019s Galacticos - have at times cast jealous eyes at the black-and-golds,\nAlthough Young has at times seemed perplexed by it, Derek Richardson\u2019s arrival, the move to Coventry and the subsequent bond issue has seen Wasps connected with almost every big name player.\nAgents drop out the Wasps name to inflate their clients\u2019 values, while baseless rumours such as the \u201cDavid Pocock eyes up Ricoh move\u201d story from 18 months or so ago, rapidly develop a life of their own.\nSo in this sense at least, we can now presumably replace \u201cWasps\u201d with \u201cBristol\u201d - even if Pat Lam\u2019s Championship club will this season face Jersey, Ealing and Hartpury rather than Europe\u2019s big guns.\nAnd like it or not, rugby traditionalists must look at Piutau\u2019s career choice and conclude that economic reality will sometimes trump the game\u2019s traditional ethos.\nHad the former Auckland Blue opted to return to New Zealand, it is quite conceivable he could have finished his playing days after the 2023 World Cup with upwards of 100 All Black caps.\nHowever, his bank balance would have been appreciably smaller, which for a man whose Pacific Island origins are humble by western standards, and who has a large extended family to provide for, is an understandably big consideration.\nSo rather than drawing premature conclusions about the player\u2019s motivation, Wasps\u2019 preferred approach and where Bristol\u2019s ambition may lead both the club and the wider English game, it might be better to simply enjoy the situation in front of us.\nEnglish rugby fans will get to see one of the world\u2019s leading players perform week-in, week-out, while Dai will struggle by with some combination of Willie Le Roux, Christian Wade, Marcus Watson, Rob Miller and Josh Bassett in his back three.\nDespite what Twitter suggests, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll all cope."}

{"id":"df1f4f16-6923-43e2-b924-569f1c3be0b8","text":"So far, the buildup to Ontario\u2019s 2018 election has focused largely on personalities. This is a pity, since it\u2019s hard to think of a jurisdiction in North America more desperate for serious discussion about innovative, pro-growth public policy than Ontario.\nWhen it comes to economic growth, government debt, private-sector job creation or median household income growth, Ontario\u2019s performance over the past decade has been the worst or among the worst in Canada. So it\u2019s high time public discourse in Ontario pivot to important policy issues and big ideas for change.\nPerhaps the best place to start is a fundamental re-examination of Ontario\u2019s approach to personal income taxation. Ontario\u2019s uncompetitive personal income tax system, with seven brackets and a top combined federal-provincial marginal rate of 53.53 per cent, discourages high-skilled Ontarians from engaging in productive activity such as work and entrepreneurship, and creating opportunities in Ontario.\nComparing Ontario\u2019s top personal income rate to other jurisdictions underscores our competitiveness problem. Again, the top marginal rate is critically important because it influences the economic decision-making of doctors, lawyers, professionals, entrepreneurs and other high-skilled professionals. At 53.53 per cent, Ontario\u2019s is the second-highest combined federal-provincial (or federal-state) marginal income tax rate in Canada and the United States. Nearby states with whom Ontario competes, including Michigan, Pennsylvania and Indiana, all have top marginal rates more than 10 percentage points lower.\nAnother way to boost the province\u2019s growth prospects and competitiveness would be to reduce Ontario\u2019s general corporate income tax rate.\nRecent federal corporate tax reform in the U.S. has wiped away Ontario\u2019s former business tax advantage over all U.S. states, harming the province\u2019s ability to attract entrepreneurs and investment. As noted in a recent Fraser Institute study, to address this challenge, the Ontario government could tax all taxable income \u2014 personal income and general business income \u2014 at the same single rate of eight per cent. This reform would transform Ontario into one of the most attractive tax jurisdictions in North America for investment and talent.\nOn the personal income tax, this reform would leave Ontario with a top combined rate of 41 per cent. Instead of the second-highest marginal rate in Canada and the U.S., Ontario would have the 12th-lowest.\nOn the corporate income tax, a 3.5-point reduction from 11.5 per cent to 8.0 per cent would leave Ontario with one of the lowest combined federal-provincial statutory general corporate tax rates in the two countries.\nSome may object that such tax reductions, which would cost the province around $11 billion in 2018-19 (including provisions to ensure lower- and middle-income families are not made worse off by the changes), are not fiscally prudent. But they are affordable if the government is willing to exercise spending restraint. Holding nominal spending for this fiscal year at 2017-18 levels (instead of proceeding with a planned six per cent spending increase) would pay for more than half of this proposed reform. One more year of frozen nominal spending would cover the remainder and then some. Clearly, pro-growth tax reform is possible if it\u2019s a priority.\nAfter a long pre-campaign focused largely on personalities, a pivot to policy is overdue. Ontario needs big ideas. Hopefully, this proposed tax reform, to make Ontario one of the most attractive jurisdictions on the continent, will help foster this type of discussion.\nBen Eisen is director of the Fraser Institute\u2019s Ontario Prosperity Initiative. This column was co-authored by Joel Emes, a senior fellow at the Fraser Institute."}

{"id":"ad0bb5e1-1dd7-41a6-a1c5-ba60a06db71d","text":"In May, Netflix announced plans to adapt The Witcher, a series of books by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski. Now, it\u2019s been confirmed that the task of bringing the novels to the streaming service will fall to Lauren Schmidt Hissrich.\nHissrich has a longstanding relationship with Netflix, having served as an executive producer on both Daredevil and The Defenders. She also received writing credits for episodes of those two shows, as well as Power, Private Practice, and The West Wing, the series that helped her start her career in writing for television.\nNot much is known about plans for Netflix\u2019s take on The Witcher, save for the fact that it has been given a multiple-series order. Hissrich is set to serve as both an executive producer and the showrunner, according to Variety.\nThe Witcher is best known to audiences outside of Europe as a series of hit role-playing games developed by CD Projekt Red. However, these titles are set after the series of novels and don\u2019t serve as a direct adaptation of Sapkowski\u2019s work.\nIndeed, the author has expressed some disdain for CD Projekt Red\u2019s output, as critically acclaimed as it has proven to be. Sapkowski made no secret of his opinion of both the titles themselves \u2013 and the medium of video games as a whole \u2013 in an interview with Waypoint published earlier this year.\nStill, the Netflix series is set to serve as something of a collaboration between the talent that made both the books and the games so compelling for fantasy fans. Sapkowski will serve as a creative consultant, while the director of the computer-generated intros for the CD Projekt Red adaptations, Tomasz Baginski, will direct at least one episode in each season.\nIt\u2019s difficult to imagine just how Netflix\u2019s The Witcher will play out \u2014 the success of Game of Thrones has proven that there\u2019s an audience out there for epic fantasy, but The Witcher has a much greater emphasis on monsters from the outset than the early seasons of HBO\u2019s hit series did. It remains to be seen whether the masses will catch on, but fans of the books and the games alike have plenty of reason to be excited."}

{"id":"98b272c7-5db6-4dd6-b6bd-239c26986a4e","text":"After Bryan Colangelo left the Toronto Raptors five years ago, he vanished. Not from life \u2014 he still lived in Yorkville, still watched his son play high school basketball, was occasionally glimpsed having a drink with someone from the basketball world. But in terms of public events, in places NBA people were seen, he wasn\u2019t there. When he appeared at an MLSE party at all-star weekend in 2016, his reappearance was noted. He had, after all, experienced a near-death career exile. He looked good. People were looking at Colangelo differently Wednesday, after a story by Ben Detrick on the website The Ringer that, if you are one of the lucky folks who do not live online, requires some explanation. Essentially, five anonymous, so-called burner accounts on Twitter seem linked to Colangelo, the Philadelphia 76ers president of basketball operations. Burner accounts are just ways to lurk, to listen in or shout, or to sway a Presidential election to destroy the global order if everything goes well.\nSixers executive Bryan Colangelo is denying a report connecting him to Twitter accounts that criticized Sixers players Joel Embiid and Markelle Fultz, among other NBA figures. ( Matt Rourke \/ The Associated Press )\nThese burner accounts appear to fit a pattern. Obsessed with the Sixers, and to a lesser extent, the Raptors. They follow people connected to Colangelo\u2019s life. They criticized Raptors president Masai Ujiri, and Colangelo\u2019s 76ers predecessor, Sam Hinkie. They slammed Sixers players, from superstar Joel Embiid to No. 1 pick Markelle Fultz. And they disclosed potentially sensitive medical information about then-Sixers like Jahlil Okafor. They defended Colangelo. They knew something. A lot, even. Colangelo admitted to operating only the most anodyne of the five accounts; he has denied knowledge of the rest. Some of it is hard to explain away. When The Ringer asked the 76ers about two of the five accounts, and only two, the other three went private on the same day. Colangelo was also said to be obsessed with Ujiri, whom he hired as an assistant GM before Ujiri displaced him in 2013. So Embiid, the first truly online sports superstar, spent Tuesday night roasting his boss on Twitter. The team has announced an internal investigation. As Embiid told ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, \u201cI talked to him and he said that he didn\u2019t say that. He called me just to deny the story. Gotta believe him until proven otherwise. If true though, that would be really bad.\u201d\nArticle Continued Below\nFriends and colleagues of Colangelo expressed disbelief that it could be him. He would not take risks like that; he would not call Ujiri, whom he hired to work for the Raptors, a \u201ctrust fund baby\u201d living off Colangelo\u2019s decisions; especially not when he was the son of one of the true titan executives and owners in the NBA, Jerry Colangelo. Defending his own famously high collars? Occasionally mangled English? As one source who knows Colangelo well said, \u201cIt\u2019s close to what he says, but he wouldn\u2019t say some of that stuff.\u201d Even in off-the-record, late-night conversations with friends during his exile, Colangelo never slammed Ujiri. The counterpoint was that in Toronto and Phoenix, Colangelo was both someone who evinced outward confidence and who held a deep insecurity. At summer league in Las Vegas, a media member once pointed out to Colangelo that he had a spot of mustard on a golf shirt; Colangelo would half-jokingly bring it up for months. Some staffers said he had a Google alert set for his own name, so anything written would pop up in his inbox. They said Bryan didn\u2019t just read the coverage: he obsessed over the comments, too. The No. 1 rule of the internet, of course, is Don\u2019t Read The Comments. But Colangelo\u2019s security, according to people who know him well, stems back to his father. Jerry is said to have been unfailingly supportive and proud, but Bryan has tried to escape that shadow anyway. As a friend said, it\u2019s Bryan \u201cfeeling like he\u2019s chasing a ghost he will never catch.\u201d So if Colangelo was going to do it, that was why. Because Toronto took off after he left, and the cult of Sam Hinkie still lingers in Philadelphia, and because the anonymity of Twitter would have given him the first chance in his life to talk back at critics, to let it all out. Executives in every sport privately trash players and coaches and rivals. Just not in public. Wednesday night, several Sixers fan accounts sleuthed something: the phone number associated with three of the accounts ended in 91, and while that wasn\u2019t Colangelo\u2019s number, it appeared to match the phone number of his wife, Barbara Bottini, as evidenced from a memo from the time she was the head of the Parents\u2019 Organization at Upper Canada College. One league source close to the situation had said they were 99.9 per cent sure it wasn\u2019t him. Well.\nShe has always been a big part of his career, and she would have been there when he was sidelined, cast into limbo, afraid his career \u2014 his reason for being, in a lot of ways \u2014 was over. She would have known how much he needed to succeed, and needed to be seen to succeed. Roger Goodell\u2019s wife secretly defended him on Twitter. Colangelo\u2019s wife appears to have done the same. The fact that the accounts went dark \u2014 well, it seems like he must have known. So in a league where an MVP, Kevin Durant, used a burner account to defend himself, it\u2019s a most NBA scandal, a most 2018 scandal, in a world where the Internet breaks more and more brains. It\u2019s the strangest, funniest, craziest sports league in the world, where a scandal can be otherworldly, and so strangely, sadly human.\nRead more about:"}

He is two now but he had been really poorly ever since his birth.\n\u201cI knew after that that I had to get back on the path to getting healthy and I also have two other children who needed me so I joined Elaine Towsey\u2019s Slimming World group. I have tried going it alone in the past and it doesn't really work for me. That's why I went to Elaine's group.\n\u201cI lost 7 stone 5lb with her support and I'm a stone from my target weight now. Altogether I have lost 11 stone. I was a size 30 now I am down to a ten.\u201d\nSo just how did Danni do it?\n\u201cDon't put too much pressure on yourself. It takes time; it won't just fall off,\u201d she revealed when asked what her secret was and what her advice would be to others in a similar situation.\n\u201cYou will have slip ups along the way but just pick yourself up and carry on. If you want it badly enough: you can do it.\n\u201cI started to notice a difference with my weight almost straight away because before I had Alfie I was following the plan. I just lost my way once I got pregnant.\n\u201cThe only thing I don't really touch is pizza. I can still have it but it's easier and cheaper to make my own and it\u2019s healthier too. I still love my chocolate and I can still enjoy that. I enjoy cooking things from scratch now and making sure there is plenty of vegetables and fruit in my meals.\n\u201cSlimming World helped a lot; there is a fantastic group of people there and exercise wise I walk everywhere and chase after my three children if that counts!\u201d"}

What are you hearing in the states?\u201d he said. Because he is dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Maria\u2019s, his tone worried me.\nMy brother, however, was not referring to the hurricane but to a statement Trump made during his visit to Puerto Rico that day: \"I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you've thrown our budget a little out of whack.\u201d The words suggested abandonment.\nThis is not the typical statement presidents make when visiting disaster victims, but then again there is nothing typical about Trump. Not a week had passed since Hurricane Maria demolished Puerto Rico when he tweeted about the U.S. territory\u2019s debt, saying that Texas and Florida were doing great but Puerto Rico was in \"deep trouble.\" He tweeted about Puerto Rico's old electrical grid which was in \"terrible shape\" and the billions it owes Wall Street.\nAnd on the same evening my brother called, Trump appeared on Hannity stating that Puerto Rico\u2019s debt would have to be waived, not really knowing what this entails.\nPlay Facebook\nTwitter\nEmbed Life After Maria: 'Living This is Something That I Don't Wish on Anybody' 1:31 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\nFirst, the PROMESA law enacted by Congress last year already sets a legal process to restructure and reduce Puerto Rico\u2019s $74 billion debt. Second, Congress is more likely to cut Puerto Rico a break by providing financial assistance than by assuming its debt.\nIt is clear from Trump\u2019s comments during this devastating humanitarian crisis that money is the main thing on his mind. It is also clear that Trump wants to walk away from his Puerto Rico problem in the same way he walked away from his bankrupt casinos. Except he can\u2019t.\nIf the United States walks away from Puerto Rico the Island will be depopulated. If Puerto Rico\u2019s infrastructure is not restored and its commercial and industrial base not reestablished, if its small business owners are not supported and its health care is not accessible, Puerto Ricans will stampede out of the Island and join the almost half a million who left before them because of the fiscal crisis.\nWith its tax base eroded the Puerto Rican government will be permanently crippled and unable to service its remaining population, let alone the debt.\nRELATED: 'A Nightmare': Recovery Stifled for Puerto Ricans in Hard-Hit Towns\nOnce Puerto Ricans arrive they will begin to use federal, state and local government programs that are often more costly to provide in the United States than on the Island. For instance, the federal government spends about $5,790 less in Medicaid and $3,492 less in Medicare per person in Puerto Rico than on the mainland.\nPolitically speaking, not investing in Puerto Rico could hurt the GOP. New Puerto Rican arrivals could turn states like Florida blue, as they will never forget that the head of the Republican Party turned his back on them.\nSo it appears that Trump cannot walk away from this particular deal without making matters worse.\nMayda Melendez, a family medical practitioner from Delaware embraces resident Maria Diaz at the Petroamerica Pagan de Colon assisted living facility in San Juan, Puerto Rico on Oct. 1, 2017. The San Juan Medical Relief Team assist vulnerable elderly at Petroamerica Pagan de Colon assisted living facility. The team includes mostly medical volunteers born in Puerto Rico that now live in the U.S. Frail elderly are particularly vulnerable to sweltering heat from lack of power, lack of medications, water and other shortages after Hurricane Maria ravaged the island. Carol Guzy \/ for NBC News\nThe smartest to thing for Trump to do is to tackle the Puerto Rico problem before it grows out of control.\nThere are some immediate measures he can take.\nFirst, he should ensure that Puerto Rico has the military and civilian personnel and the assets needed to restore transportation, telecommunications and electricity; to ensure relief supplies are delivered; and, to preserve law and order.\nSecond, he should waive funding caps, eliminate local match requirements, and give Puerto Rico greater access to federal assistance programs in FEMA and Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, Transportation and others.\nThird, he should extend the Jones Act waiver for Puerto Rico beyond the 10 days approved initially. The Jones Act requires that only vessels built, owned and operated by Americans be used between U.S. ports. By allowing foreign vessels to deliver goods Puerto Rico will have greater access to fuel, food, medicines, clothing, and building supplies. Since U.S. vessels are more expensive, the waiver will also lower the cost of imported goods needed for recovery and reconstruction.\nHurricane Maria was a hurricane like no one has ever seen. In terms of overall intensity, Hurricane Maria is the 6th hurricane in a ranking of more than 13,000 cyclone events around the world since 1950.\nRELATED: Puerto Rico\u2019s Hospitals Still in Triage Mode, 2 Weeks After Maria\nHurricane Maria could lower Puerto Rican incomes by 21 percent over the next 15 years, which represents a $180 billion loss in economic output.\nUnlike hurricane-ravaged states, Puerto Rico does not have the resources to rebuild after FEMA pulls out. Preliminary estimates place storm damage north of $90 billion.\nWater flows from PVC pipes that capture spring water and provide a makeshift water station for Utuado residents who have been without water since Hurricane Maria hit in Puerto Rico on Oct. 5, 2017. Suzanne Gamboa \/ NBC News\nTherefore, Congress must appropriate funds specifically earmarked for Puerto Rico\u2019s disaster relief and reconstruction. This needs to include access to emergency liquidity programs because the Puerto Rican government expects to run out of cash in three to four weeks.\nWhen the U.S. Department of Treasury officials warned back in 2015 that Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal problems could turn into a humanitarian crisis they were accused of exaggerating the situation. People could not see the crisis because the crisis was developing in slow motion.\nFor us Puerto Ricans it was clear. We all knew people who had left the Island looking for better jobs. Parents, like my brother, sent their children to college in the states no longer expecting them to return. Businesses closed and houses were shuttered. There was less traffic in San Juan.\nAll Hurricane Maria did was to speed up and intensify the humanitarian crisis for the whole world to see. There is still time to reverse its course but only if we take action now."}

Libyans were also aboard.\nLibya has for years been a major transit route for migrants trying to reach southern Europe by sea.\nEU countries have wrangled over both reducing migrant numbers and deciding which countries are responsible for processing migrants on arrival.\nThe EU struck a deal with the Libyan coastguard last year to help intercept migrants and return them to Libya.\nBut aid agencies and the UN accused European governments of taking an \u201cinhuman\u201d approach.\nWhat happened in the latest disaster?\nFrom a boat carrying more than 90, only three survivors are reported \u2013 two of whom managed to swim to shore, while the third was picked up by a fishing boat.\n\u201cTen bodies are reported to have washed up on Libyan shores,\u201d the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said in a statement.\nUnusually, there were also Libyans among the dead and survivors of the shipwreck, reports the BBC\u2019s North Africa correspondent Rana Jawad.\nThe Facebook page of the security directorate in the coastal city of Zuwara, where the bodies washed up, said a Libyan woman had drowned, but that of the three survivors two were Libyan nationals.\nWhat\u2019s unusual about the nationalities of those on board?\nThe majority of incidents of this kind involve migrants from sub-Saharan Africa.\nIn this case, most of those on board were Pakistani. The IOM says this is becoming more common.\nWhile Pakistanis were 13th on a list of the number of migrants trying to reach Europe last year by nationality, so far this year they are third, the IOM says.\nPerhaps aware of the danger, Libyans rarely attempt the boat journey from their country to southern Europe.\nSome cases of illegal Libyan migration were documented last year, but they usually involved sturdier boats that were carrying few people.\nHaven\u2019t the numbers of migrants reaching Europe been declining?\nOverall this year, the IOM reports that there have been 6,624 arrivals by sea to Europe, compared to 5,983 in the same period of 2017.\nSo the numbers are comparable but this year\u2019s figures still represent a considerable bounce-back following a dramatic fall over the second half of 2017, the IOM told the BBC.\nSome of last year\u2019s decline can be attributed to the EU\u2019s controversial deal with the Libyan coastguard, but the IOM also believes there were difficulties within the people-trafficking industry.\n\u201cWe think that there was a lot of pent-up demand in terms of migrants being held in warehouses by the smugglers,\u201d said the IOM\u2019s Joel Millman.\nIf the channels have been opened again, that might explain the sudden surge which has seen numbers increase again."}

For 66 years, this annual report has served as an energy industry statistical bible of sorts, painting the broad picture of global energy development.\nIn an opening letter, BP CEO Bob Dudley stressed the need to \"keep our focus and efforts on reducing carbon emissions.\"\nHe also voiced support for the Paris Climate Agreement, an international pact that commits nearly all countries to fighting global warming. This puts BP in opposition to President Donald Trump, who on June 1 announced he would withdraw the U.S. from the agreement.\nHere are some of the biggest takeaways from BP's annual report:\nRenewable energy is the \"leading light of the energy transition\"\nView photos\nImage: BP statistical review of world energy\nRenewable power generation grew by 14.1 percent last year, according to BP, which doesn't include hydropower in this group. While that's slightly below the 10-year average, it's the still the largest annual addition yet.\nSolar power in particular jumped 29.6 percent, while wind power grew by 15.6 percent.\nRenewables' share of the global energy mix is still fairly small \u2014 about 3.2 percent \u2014 but last year's strong growth meant that solar, wind, and other sources accounted for nearly one-third of the increase in energy supplies.\nView photos\nImage: BP statistical review of world energy\nChina was the biggest force in this sector. The world's most populous country and top greenhouse gas emitter contributed more than 40 percent of global renewable energy growth in 2016, which helped it surpass the United States as the largest renewable power producer.\nThe U.S. isn't likely to reclaim the top spot anytime soon. China is vowing to invest $361 billion in renewables by 2020, yet the Trump administration is doubling down on fossil fuel production, all while criticizing China for not doing enough to control its emissions."}

During the weeks he traveled there, he opted to stay with a local couple, Nancy and Robert Ellis, rather than his parents.\nRobert Ellis is an oncologist and Nancy is a former nurse, so he\u2019s been able to learn more about what a doctor\u2019s life in Vancouver is like through his homestay. He said before his time with the Ellises, he wasn\u2019t sure what kind of medicine he wanted to practice.\n\u201cNow he\u2019s converted me.

But students spend a week at their site three times during the first year and another three during their second to get to know the community and get early hands-on experience with patients.\nSome host families work in the medical field. Others are just community members who want to help out.\nAmanda Hansen is in the latter category.

A breakdown of the reorganization, which was announced Monday, shows 31 people were laid off and 30 vacant jobs were eliminated. Four additional employees resigned, retired or transferred within the district,\nThe district provided job titles but not names of affected employees.\nCommunications, information technology and operations took major hits.\nSee the list of affected jobs here.\nThe senior director of equity and partnerships, the deputy human resources officer position and the senior directors of curriculum and instruction and teaching and learning were also eliminated. Those last two positions are currently held by interims.\nThe widespread job cuts represent Guerrero's most sweeping personnel changes since he came to Portland in October. That said, he hasn't hesitated in the new job. Weeks in, he fired his second in command.\nGuerrero's announcement blamed the reorganization on budget woes. He said it was necessary to slash central office to avoid cuts to schools.\nTwo high-level employees resigned amid the reorganization: Chief Operating Officer Jerry Vincent and Chief Strategic Officer Laura Parker.\nVincent, who joined the district in 2015, has had to shoulder the brunt of some of the district's most complex and controversial problems. Vincent oversaw the district's two bond projects and efforts to fix multiple hazards inside the district's schools, and he also was tasked with puzzling out how to make good on efforts to open new middle schools in the face of numerous expensive and hard to solve building and site problems.\nParker joined the district a year ago. Her job, chief strategic officer, was a new senior leadership role created when the district had an interim superintendent.\nPortland Public Schools saw a considerable number of high-level employees leave, including the district's longtime superintendent, since a 2016 lead-in-drinking water scandal.\nThat crisis shook the culture of Oregon's largest school district and revealed not only trouble with safe water and other hazards, but deep dysfunction to include problems with sound systems and accountability throughout the district's departments.\nA newly-elected school board hired Guerrero over the summer with the hope he'd bring a new vision to Portland Public Schools and repair community trust.

Several big brands, including Marks & Spencer, Next and Amazon also sell \u201ce-gift cards\u201d or \u201ce-vouchers\u201d.\nBut an investigation by Which? found only a handful of retailers let you spend money on a gift voucher or gift card indefinitely.\nThe rest pocket any leftover cash after a certain period of time \u2013 the UK Gift Card & Voucher Association puts the figure at about \u00a3300million a year.\n\u201cShops make millions from unclaimed or expired gift cards, which is why they put expiry dates on them, in the hope people will forget to use them in time,\u201d said Hannah Maundrell, editor-in-chief of money.co.uk\n\u201cThis seems really unfair and it would be great to see shops ditch expiry dates on gift cards all together.\u201d\nThe vouchers with the shortest time limits (and the ones that NEVER expire)\nUntil it changed its rules, Ocado was by far the worst offender with its former eight-week limit - but popular retailers including JD Sports, Love2shop, Pandora, Sunglasses Hut, Ted Baker, Westfield all have a limit of just 12 months on gift vouchers.\nThe standard expiry time is two years. Boots, Debenhams, House of Fraser, H&M, H.Samuel, John Lewis, M&S, New Look, River Island, and Topshop, among others, all offer a 24-month limit on when vouchers can be used. Argos\u2019 gift vouchers expire three years from purchase, Tesco five years, and Amazon 10 years.\nOnly a minority of retailers, including Selfridges, the Apple Store and Disney sell gift cards or vouchers which never expire.\nJames Daley, founder of Fairer Finance, says there's no good reason why shops should put expiry dates on gift cards at all. \u201cThey only do it as it's convenient for them from an accounting perspective. But from a customer perspective, it's just bad practice,\" he said.\n\u201cIt's all too easy to put a gift card in the drawer when you get it. If you did that with a \u00a320 note, it would still be there for you to use when you stumbled upon it. But with gift cards, the value can evaporate under your nose.\u201d\nOther concerns\nIt\u2019s not just voucher expiry dates shoppers have to worry about. If a retailer goes bust, its gift vouchers can become worthless overnight. There is no set rule on the status of gift cards in the event of a company going bust \u2013 it tends to be up to the administrator.\nHowever, generally, gift voucher holders will be low down the pecking order of creditors.\nThere have been several high-profile company failures in recent years, such as BHS, American Apparel, Comet and Austin Reed, which have left people with gift cards they can\u2019t use.\n\u201cYou could get extra protection for gift cards over \u00a3100 if you pay with your credit card. If the retailer was to go bust you could claim your money back from your credit card provider thanks to Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act,\u201d said money.co.uk's Maundrell.\nSome gift vouchers also come with restrictions on what they can be spent on. For example, Harvey Nichols gift cards can\u2019t be redeemed online while House of Fraser vouchers can\u2019t be used to purchase large kitchen appliances online."}

During this interim period, which will be negotiated with Brussels, Britain will look to negotiate bold new trade relationships around the world\u201d, the British statement said.\nIt said this arrangement would be \"time-limited\u201d, but without giving a deadline.\nIt also said it would \u201callow for a smooth and orderly transfer\u201d to the final customs regime.\nThe final regime would either be a \u201ccustoms partnership\u201d or a \u201chighly streamlined customs arrangement\u201d, it said.\nThe \u201cpartnership\u201d would \u201cnegate the need for a customs border\" between the UK and EU states.\nIt would mean the UK imposed the same tariffs and checks on international imports as the EU and collected customs duties on behalf of EU countries on items that entered the bloc via its ports.\nThe \u201cstreamlined\u201d deal would mean a new customs border, including with Ireland.\nBut this would use high-tech solutions to create \u201cthe freest and most frictionless possible trade\u201d, such as CCTV that recognised the number plates of lorries carrying goods of \u201ctrusted traders\u201d to avoid systematic vehicle checks.\nThe ideas were welcomed by British industry lobbyists, despite the fact they go against the EU\u2019s previous red lines.\nThe EU has said it would be illegal for the UK to negotiate new trade deals around the world so long as it is still inside its customs union.\nIt has also said it wants a deal on EU citizens\u2019 rights, on the Irish border, and on the UK\u2019s EU exit bill before negotiating future trade relations.\nPhil Hogan, the EU\u2019s agriculture commissioner, told the Financial Times, a British newspaper, that he welcomed the UK\u2019s \u201cappetite for a pragmatic and reasonable outcome to a free-trade agreement\u201d.\nBut he said \u201cthere\u2019s a high level of delusion in London\u201d on the amount of legal work to be done to implement its ideas in time and on the willingness of the other 27 EU states to agree to its proposals.\nKeir Starmer, the shadow Brexit minister from the opposition Labour party in the UK, was even more critical.\nHe said the proposals were \u201cfantastical and contradictory\u201d because they spoke of a new customs border that was not really a border.\n\u201cThe cabinet remain split on key issues and cannot decide between two very different but equally unachievable options,\u201d he said.\nThe Irish government said in a statement on Monday the \u201cimmediate focus\u201d of EU talks should be \u201ccitizens' rights, the financial settlement and the Irish specific issues\u201d.\nSinn Fein, the Irish nationalist party, called the idea of a \u201cstreamlined\u201d border \u201cnonsense and impossible to deliver\u201d.\n\u201cThey [the British government] are prepared to impose an EU frontier across Ireland and are prepared to play fast and loose with our economy and peace agreements,\u201d David Cullinane, its Brexit spokesman said."}

Our study shows that it is already happening.\"\nAs Common Dreams reported in 2015, NASA climate scientist James Hansen first raised concerns about the feedback loop then. As the Post reports, Hansen explained that the melting of glaciers would create fresh water, blocking cold salt water from sinking to the bottom of the ocean and protecting the ice shelves from melting:\nWhen cold surface water no longer sinks into the depths, a deeper layer of warm ocean water can travel across the continental shelf and reach the bases of glaciers, retaining its heat as the cold waters remain above. This warmer water then rapidly melts the glaciers and the large floating ice shelves connected to them.\nThe continuous melting cycle could soon begin to cause rapidly-rising sea levels and destructive hurricanes and other storms.\n\"That would mean loss of all coastal cities, most of the world's large cities and all their history,\" said Hansen when his paper on the feedback loop theory was released.\nHansen told the Post that the new research \"provides a nice small-scale example\" of the patterns he predicted.\n\"If we stay on business-as-usual [greenhouse gas] emissions rates, so that global warming continues to increase, I expect that the freshwater injection rate will increase (mainly via ice faster ice shelf breakup and underwater melt) and sea ice area will increase. This experiment will be playing out over the next years and decades,\" said Hansen in an email to the Post.\nAnders Levermann, a climate scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, noted that it was \"curious\" that the feedback loop \"is occurring now, after 10,000 years of stability, while we are ramping up the temperature of the planet.\"\n\"Trying to dismiss the idea that it has anything to do with global warming is also very difficult,\" he told the Scientific American."}

The company has designed chips powering its mobile devices for several years.\nIts move into displays has the long-term potential to hurt a range of suppliers, from screen makers like Samsung Electronics; Japan Display; Sharp; and LG Display to companies like Synaptics that produce chip-screen interfaces. It may also hurt Universal Display, a leading developer of OLED technology.\nShares in display makers in Asia fell on the publication of the report. Controlling MicroLED technology would help Apple stand out in a maturing smartphone market and outgun rivals like Samsung that have been able to tout superior screens.\nRay Soneira, who runs screen tester DisplayMate Technologies, says bringing the design in-house is a \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d for Apple.\n\u201cEveryone can buy an OLED or LCD screen,\u201d he says. \u201cBut Apple could own MicroLED.\u201d\nNone of this will be easy. Mass producing the new screens will require new manufacturing equipment. By the time the technology is ready, something else might have supplanted it.\nApple could run into insurmountable hurdles and abandon the project or push it back. It\u2019s also an expensive endeavour.\nUltimately, Apple will likely outsource production of its new screen technology to minimise the risk of hurting its bottom line with manufacturing snafus.\nThe California facility is too small for mass-production, but the company wants to keep the proprietary technology away from its partners as long as possible, a source says.\n\u201cWe put a lot of money into the facility,\u201d this source says.\nIt\u2019s big enough to get through the engineering builds [and] lets us keep everything in-house during the development stages.\nRight now smartphones and other gadgets essentially use off-the-shelf display technology. The Apple Watch screen is made by LG Display. Ditto for Google\u2019s larger Pixel phone. The iPhone X, Apple\u2019s first OLED phone, uses Samsung technology.\nPhone manufacturers tweak screens to their specifications, and Apple has for years calibrated iPhone screens for color accuracy. But this marks the first time Apple is designing screens end-to-end itself.\nThe secret initiative, code-named T159, is overseen by executive Lynn Youngs, an Apple veteran who helped develop touch screens for the original iPhone and iPad and now oversees iPhone and Apple Watch screen technology.\nThe 62,000-square-foot manufacturing facility, the first of its kind for Apple, is located on an otherwise unremarkable street in Santa Clara in California, a 15-minute drive from the Apple Park campus in Cupertino and near a few other unmarked Apple offices.\niPhone X\nThere, about 300 engineers are designing and producing MicroLED screens for use in future products. The facility also has a special area for the intricate process of \u201cgrowing\u201d LEDs.\nAnother facility nearby houses technology that handles so-called LED transfers: The process of placing individual pixels into a MicroLED screen. Apple inherited the intellectual property for that process when it purchased startup LuxVue in 2014.\nAbout a year after that acquisition, Apple opened a display research lab (described internally as a \u201cTechnology Center\u201d) in Taiwan.\nIn a test to see if the company could pull off in-house display manufacturing, engineers in Taiwan first built a small number of LCD screens using Apple technology.\nThey were assembled at the Santa Clara factory and retrofitted into iPhone 7 prototypes. Apple executives tested them, then gave the display team the go-ahead to move forward with the development of Apple-designed MicroLED screens.\nThe complexity of building a screen manufacturing facility meant it took Apple several months to get the California plant operational.\nOnly in recent months have Apple engineers grown confident in their ability to eventually replace screens from Samsung and other suppliers."}

REUTERS\/Stringer\nThe official Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) released on Thursday rose to 51.9 in May, from 51.4 in April, and remained well above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction for the 22nd straight month.\nAnalysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast the reading would dip slightly to 51.3.\nProduction expanded at the fastest rate in six months while growth in new orders rose to an 8-month high. Export orders also accelerated from the previous month.\nThe strong manufacturing sector readings defy concerns about an expected loss of momentum in Asia\u2019s powerhouse economy, as policymakers navigate debt risks and rocky trade relations with the United States.\nWashington said on Tuesday that it was moving forward with its threat to apply tariffs on Chinese imports worth up to $50 billion, reviving fresh worries of a trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. Trade tensions had ebbed only recently after Beijing pledged to buy more from the United States.\nHi-tech manufacturing activity rose to 54.8 in May, up from April\u2019s 53.8, despite pending U.S. tariff list under its intellectual property probe and restrictions on Chinese investments in the U.S.\nChina\u2019s economy grew at a slightly faster-than-expected pace of 6.8 percent in the first quarter. However, signs of stress have started to emerge with investment growth slowing to a near 20-year low in April and growth in retail sales sliding.\nChina has been tightening controls on riskier investments, the shadow banking business and speculation in the property sector, but has been keen to keep the broad economy well funded.\nThe industrial sector, a key source of jobs, remained in healthy shape, with profits growing at their fastest pace in six months, underpinned by continued strength in the steel sector.\nBoosted by government infrastructure spending, a resilient housing market and unexpected strength in exports, China\u2019s manufacturers helped the economy deliver strong growth last year.\nEconomists still expect China\u2019s economic growth to slow to 6.5 percent this year from 6.9 percent in 2017, citing rising borrowing costs, tougher limits on industrial pollution and a crackdown on local governments\u2019 spending to keep their debt levels in check.\nA sister survey showed growth in China\u2019s service sector also picked up pace in May, with the official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) edging up to 54.9 from 54.8 the previous month.\nA sub-reading for construction activity, a major driver of growth in 2017, stood at 60.1 in May, down from 60.6 in April.\nChinese policymakers are counting on growth in services and consumption to rebalance their economic growth model from its heavy reliance on investment and exports. The services sector now accounts for over half of the economy, with rising wages giving Chinese consumers more spending clout.\nA composite PMI covering both the manufacturing and services activity rose to 54.6 in May, from April\u2019s 54.1.\n(For graphic on China economic indicator dashboard, click: tmsnrt.rs\/2lQ48De)"}

Protectionism could damage growth, he added.\nA draft G-20 communique seen by Reuters last week said something similar but it was not clear if it would be retained in the final version of the statement to be published on Tuesday and which has to be agreed by unanimity.\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin pushed back at the meeting, saying the U.S. could not sacrifice its own interests so that the system worked.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the secretary represents the president\u2019s very strong view that we believe in free trade,\u201d one U.S. official told reporters.\n\u201cBut the environment we\u2019re in now, where the expectation is America totally subordinates its national interests in order for the free trade system to work, is just one we don\u2019t accept. So, we\u2019ve been very clear, we believe in free trade with reciprocal terms that leads to more balanced trade relationships,\u201d he said.\nOthers at the G-20 meeting shared Europe\u2019s concerns.\n\u201cThere is a solid understanding among the global community that free trade is important,\u201d Haruhiko Kuroda, Japan\u2019s central bank governor, told reporters.\nThe U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs have raised global alarm that the U.S. would dismantle the trading system based on World Trade Organization rules in favor of unilateral actions.\nCanada and Mexico are exempt from the tariffs, which enter into force on Friday and are mainly aimed at China. But the European Union wants to be exempted, too.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been clear with (U.S. Treasury Secretary) Steve Mnuchin that we are waiting for a full exemption from these new American tariffs for the European Union as a whole,\u201d French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told reporters.\n\u201cI think we should reach that goal. It\u2019s difficult (but) it\u2019s not out of reach,\u201d he added.\nWithout an exemption, the EU will retaliate with a series of measures it is already preparing, Moscovici said.\nAfter meeting with U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in Washington, German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said he and Ross agreed that U.S.-EU talks on the tariffs should intensify.\n\u201cWe are convinced that free trade is the best solution to guarantee the well-being of our peoples. We want that world trade remains fair and void of dumping measures,\u201d Altmaier said.\nThe broad anti-China tariffs and investment restrictions under consideration as part of a U.S. intellectual property probe have raised concerns that retaliation could hit world trade and choke off the strongest global growth since the G-20 head of state summits began during the financial crisis a decade ago.\nAn early draft of the G-20 communique seen by Reuters contained the phrase that G-20 finance ministers stood by an agreement reached by their leaders in July last year in Hamburg.\nThat agreement said: \u201cWe note the importance of bilateral, regional and plurilateral agreements being open, transparent, inclusive and WTO-consistent, and commit to working to ensure they complement the multilateral trade agreements.\u201d\nThe Hamburg agreement, signed by all G-20 leaders including Trump, said G20 countries would fight protectionism, including all unfair trade practices, although it also said they recognize the role of \u201clegitimate trade defense instruments.\u201d\n\u201cThe problem is that everybody understands the Hamburg wording differently,\u201d a senior European official said."}

There was the AIDS quarantine measure put forward by crackpot presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche in 1986, which aimed to place everyone with the disease in remote detention camps. Would Ervin \"Magic\" Johnson be part owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers and president of the Lakers today if that one had passed?\nThere was the 1994 Proposition 187, which sought to deprive undocumented immigrants of health care, schooling and anything else its sponsors could think of. That one passed handily, endorsed by then-Gov. Pete Wilson, but was swiftly struck down by a federal judge. And so on.\nNow comes a danger of a different sort, embodied in a seemingly innocuous measure that's about to begin circulating with hopes of getting a yes-or-no vote just over a year from now.\nIs it really worth risking free speech and freedom of religion or the right to bear arms for the unlikely possibility of winning the right to secede peacefully?\nIt's titled \"The California Call for a Constitutional Convention,\" and it contains some fine ideas, including calls for Constitutional amendments to ensure equal pay for equal work and limit corporate \"personhood\" to invalidate the U.S. Supreme Court's Citizens United decision. The initiative also calls for California to participate in a constitutional convention to push for creating a peaceful way for states to secede from the Union and\/or negotiate treaties with foreign countries, and has a provision demanding that federal funding be distributed to states in proportion to what their taxpayers put into the federal kitty.\nRecommended Stories For You\nMost of those aims are laudable, but there's absolutely nothing to guarantee that any of these ideas would attain reality if this measure passes. Rather, there's the definite possibility for major alteration to the Bill of Rights, which now protects things like free speech, freedom of the press, freedom of association and guarantees there will be no official state religion.\nHow could this happen when the convention call includes very specific subjects to be taken up and none involves the Bill of Rights? Easy. Once you begin a constitutional convention, the delegates can take it where they like.\nThat's one reason why even though many states have officially called for a convention to enshrine a balanced-budget amendment, that call has never gotten support from three-quarters of the states, as required to get a convention started.\nThere's also little chance that even if California calls for a convention to take up its plentiful legitimate grievances, it will get the needed support from other states.\nThe sponsors of the new initiative, which goes by the abbreviated term CalConCon, in effect concede this. They maintain on their website (http:\/\/www.calconcon.com) that any convention call ever issued by a state \u2014 even 100 years ago or more \u2014 can be included in the total needed now.\nThat's because just as the Constitution sets no limit on where delegates can take a convention, it also has no expiration date for convention calls, which now number 27. It's an unfortunate omission by the Founding Fathers, who turn out to be fallible after all.\nMarcus Ruiz Evans of Fresno, whose 2012 book California's Next Century called for semi-sovereign status for the state and essentially began the Calexit secession movement that spawned this convention initiative, maintains there would be no \"runaway convention.\"\nBut the campaign website notes that \"the U.S. Constitution makes no mention of rescinding an application (for a convention) or limiting (it) to a single subject \u2026\"\nStill, says Ruiz, many academics have forecast a runaway convention would not happen. But how does anyone know where activists from Texas or Montana might take the meeting? Or whether there would be neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klansmen among the voting delegates?\nIt's true California several years ago called for a constitutional convention to get rid of the Citizens United decision.

A headline in the centrist Dziennik Gazeta Prawna pointed to a \"Supreme Court with two chief justices\".\nBut PiS Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki defended the disputed judicial reforms to a doubtful European Parliament on Wednesday, insisting the overhaul was his government's right.\n\"Every EU country has the right to develop its judicial system according to its own traditions,\" Morawiecki told MEPs at a session of the European Parliament in the eastern French city of Strasbourg.\nThe PiS government has refused to back down despite the EU legal action, insisting the reforms are needed to tackle corruption and overhaul a judicial system still haunted by the communist era.\nGersdorf said Tuesday that she will \"go on vacation\" after showing up at work on Wednesday. She said she had named a temporary replacement, Jozef Iwulski, to stand in for her during her absence.\nBut presidential aide Pawel Mucha told reporters that Gersdorf was \"going into retirement in accordance with the law\", which took effect at midnight Tuesday, and insisted the Supreme Court was now \"headed by Judge Jozef Iwulski\", who was chosen by the president.\nJudicial independence\nTwenty-seven of the top court's 73 judges are affected by the reform. Under the law, the judges can ask the president to prolong their terms, but he can accept or deny their requests without giving a reason.\nSixteen judges have made requests, according to Polish media reports.\nThe European Commission, the bloc's powerful executive arm, said Monday that the PiS reforms would undermine \"the irremovability of judges\" and judicial independence in Poland, breaching the country's obligations under EU law.\nPoland has a month to respond to the commission's formal announcement and the dispute could end up in the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the bloc's top tribunal.\nBrussels in December triggered so-called Article Seven proceedings against Poland over \"systemic threats\" to the rule of law, which could eventually see Warsaw's EU voting rights suspended.\nAccording to a nationwide survey carried out last month by Ariadna pollsters, 44 percent of Poles believe the ruling PiS party's judicial reforms will increase political influence on the courts, while just 14 percent of respondents thought otherwise.\nTens of thousands of Poles have hit the streets since the PiS government came to power in 2015 to protest its judicial reforms and attempts to tighten Poland's already strict abortion law, among other causes.\n\"We succeeded in getting rid of communism... so we will succeed in defending democracy as enshrined in our constitution,\" Gersdorf supporter Wlodzimierz Debski told AFP at the Supreme Court on Wednesday."}

For one thing, the device is about the size of an old Nokia brick phone, except without a screen or any of the important buttons.\nThe slim, black and grey bar \u2014 with straps that come in different colours \u2014 has an LED indicator, a micro-USB charging port, and a power button. And that\u2019s about it.\nMoreover, you can\u2019t actually use the GoTenna Mesh to send voice messages \u2014 it\u2019s an entirely text-based system.\nThe device works by connecting to an Android or iOS phone via Bluetooth; once paired, users can send messages to other GoTenna devices nearby.\nPerdomo says the range can vary from a single city block to about five kilometres \u2014 depending on environmental circumstances, as well as issues like congestion.\nWhat makes the platform so interesting is that, unlike traditional text messages that rely on cellular networks or Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp, GoTenna allows users to send and receive messages while being completely disconnected from Wi-Fi or data networks.\nHelping connect the disconnected\nPerdomo first came up with the idea for GoTenna Mesh with Jorge, her brother and fellow co-founder, in 2012, after witnessing the chaos caused by Hurricane Sandy\u2019s progression through New York City.\n\u201cIt occurred to me that even though we have phones, they don\u2019t actually enable communication unless you have service,\u201d says Perdomo.\nShe was also quick to identify an issue that many people have simply come to accept about smartphones: they don\u2019t allow users to create their own independent network connections.\n\u201cSo [phones are] in a way intentionally crippled from enabling any peer-to-peer connectivity,\u201d says Perdomo. \u201c[Phones are] designed only to plug into things.\u201d\nIt\u2019s that inability to facilitate genuine peer-to-peer connectivity that ultimately led Perdomo and her brother to develop the GoTenna Mesh system.\nAs Perdomo puts it, the device is basically a radio that has all the smarts of a smartphone.\n\u201cSo this is actually a lot more like a smartphone without an interface than it is a walkie-talkie,\u201d explains Perdomo.\nUnlike a walkie-talkie, multiple GoTenna Mesh devices also automatically form a network mesh, enabling users to more easily send messages to one another over long distances.\nTwo GoTenna Mesh devices allow two users to communicate with relative ease over long distances. Add another GoTenna device into the fray and the messages can be sent and received over even longer distances.\nThe fact that GoTenna devices automatically form a mesh means that users also don\u2019t need to work through an intricate system menu to establish a daisy-chained network.\nAdditionally, GoTenna Mesh devices connected to a phone that\u2019s connected to a cellular network can be used to give cellular-disconnected users access to the cell network itself.\nSimply put, GoTenna Mesh devices can give disconnected users the opportunity to piggyback onto a cellular network, even if their devices aren\u2019t connected to the network itself.\nA familiar interface to anyone who\u2019s sent a text message\nWhile the GoTenna platform is certainly impressive, there are a number of caveats to consider.\nFirst, you need two GoTenna devices to communicate, and each device needs to be connected via Bluetooth to an iOS or Android device.\nSecond, GoTenna devices can only be paired to one phone or tablet at a time.\nThird, you can\u2019t use the GoTenna device to send and receive messages without downloading the GoTenna app, which also helps users with the onboarding and pairing process.\nOnce a device has been paired, however, the GoTenna interface closely resembles typical messaging apps. Users can chat with individual contacts, start group chats, or send out public \u2018Shouts\u2019 to all nearby GoTenna devices.\nThe app even lets users broadcast their GPS location, to alert other users of their presence.\nIt\u2019s important to note that GoTenna messages use a path-of-least-resistance model to deliver messages. Users who are far apart will have to wait longer to send or receive a communication.\n\u201cIt gives you 38 seconds of tries and then eventually it goes\u2026delivery unconfirmed,\u201d says Perdomo.\nShe says the company chose to use the phrase \u201cdelivery unconfirmed\u201d instead of \u201cmessage failed.\u201d\n\u201cAll that means is it could\u2019ve gone through, it probably didn\u2019t, but we don\u2019t wanna [cause unnecessary alarm],\u201d explains Perdomo.\nIf smartphones do happen to disconnect from the device, a GoTenna also stores any received messages, turning it into a kind of digital mailbox.\nIn use, the GoTenna communications platform is startlingly effective.\nSimply put, what makes GoTenna messaging so extraordinary is precisely how ordinary it is. The interface is familiar, sending a message is no different than sending a text message and conversations feel natural or fluid.\nOf course, using GoTenna isn\u2019t faster than sending a text message or using an app like WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger, but that\u2019s not really why someone would use GoTenna in the first place.\nThe device isn\u2019t really for day-to-day messaging, and Perdomo acknowledges that.\nAs she puts it, GoTenna is for individuals in extenuating circumstances when it\u2019s tough to find Wi-Fi or cellular reception, but who need to maintain communication with other people.\n\u201cOutdoors, crowded events, travel, but also yes, emergencies, public safety, any situation where service is unavailable, unreliable or unaffordable,\u201d she says.\nGoTenna Mesh is available at Amazon.ca, London Drugs, Sport Chek and GoTenna.com.\nA two-pack costs $249.99 CAD, and $234.17 CAD on Amazon."}

But a new study suggests that transgender people may have a genetic disposition that influences their identity.\nFirst reported in The Times, the study, which was led by Augusta, Georgia-based doctor John Theisen, discovered a panel of genes that may provide a biological basis for gender dysphoria, which is the term used to describe those who believe their gender is opposite of their biological sex. That panel of genes includes DNA involved with the development of nerve cells and the manufacture of sex hormones, The Times reported. Researchers believe the findings add weight to the idea that transgender people have \u201cfundamental differences in their brains and biochemistry\u201d that leads to gender dysphoria. In other words, the researchers believe that the study lends legitimacy to the idea that transgender is not a choice, as some argue, but \u201ca way of being.\u201d\nStudy data was presented last week at the Society for Reproductive Investigation meeting in San Diego. The study examined DNA sequences for of 14 female-to-male and 16 male-to-female transgender people. Researchers looked for common genetic variants in the groups but turned up in fewer than one in 10,000 people in the wider population, according to the report. During the course of the study the researchers found 30 such variants, \u201cnine of which were in genes known to be implicated in the growth of brain cells or the production of sex hormones such as estrogen and testosterone,\u201d The Times said.\nAccording to a 2017 study by The Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law, there are approximately 1.4 million adults in the United States who identify as transgender. That\u2019s about .6 percent of the population and double what the estimates were about a decade ago, according to the report. As such, there has been an increase in gender reassignment surgeries in the United States. In May 2017 Time Magazine reported that there were 3,200 gender confirmation surgeries in 2016, a 20 percent increase over 2015 numbers.\nTheisen, The Times noted, stressed that the research was still in an early phase and only a small patient population has so far been explored. Because of that, there is no proof that any of the individual variants revealed in the sample is involved in gender dysphoria. Additionally, the small study has yet to be peer-reviewed. Some of the findings in the study may be the result of \u201cpure chance,\u201d The Times reported."}

But the perpetrator of the con is this man,\" Feden said.\nFeden then marched over to the table of defense lawyers where Cosby has sat for the entire trial. Inches away from him, she pointed at his face.\n\"Sitting right here. This is the man. Sitting right here,\" Feden bellowed.\n\"Nothing funny about that\"\nAndrea Constand, who was last seen by the jury when she confronted Cosby from the stand over two days, was present during the prosecution's speeches, sitting in the audience not far from the seven men and five women who will decide Cosby's fate. The panel sat listening raptly in the jury box.\n\"The law makes it very clear. The uncorroborated testimony of the victim alone is enough to convict the defendant, so if you believe Andrea Constand,\" said Feden, gesturing toward Cosby's main accuser who looked straight ahead with a stony gaze, \"you need to convict.\"\nFeden said the defense team embarked on \"character assassination\" of the five additional accusers who took the stand against Cosby, saying the \"shameful\" attacks and questions are \"the exact reason\" sexual assault victims rarely report their assailants to authorities.\nDefense lawyer Kathleen Bliss perpetuated \"rape myths\" to the jury by suggesting that victims of sexual assault bear some responsibility for being victimized, Feden argued.\nFeden, at times, mocked Bliss by putting on a fake high-pitched voice and imitating her line of questions in a derisive tone.\nThen she shot a look at Cosby and accused him of smirking.\n\"There's nothing funny about stripping a woman of her decency. There's nothing funny about that, Mr. Cosby,\" Feden yelled.\nAt that, rows of journalists stood up and tried to catch a glimpse of Cosby, who appeared expressionless.\nProsecutors projected old photographs of first woman to testify against Cosby. The wide-eyed, youthful glam shots of the woman, Heidi Thomas, taken decades ago when she was a promising young actress. The image accompanied a play-by-play description of what Thomas said happened to her: she was drugged and sexually assaulted by Cosby at a secluded ranch house in Nevada that she visited under the guise of private acting lessons.\nWith the innocent photographs of Thomas as a backdrop, Feden said Cosby's attack was no mistake: Cosby groomed and preyed on other young women the same way. He made some of the same promises of career opportunities to them before he molested them, sometimes in similar locations, such as private hotel suites, Feden said. All along, she said, Cosby assumed his victims would be too afraid to ever report him to authorities.\n\"It's the same con, ladies and gentlemen, just a different day,\" she said.\nCosby, facing the jury during this moment, shook his head in disagreement.\nSome of the most convincing evidence in the case, Feden told jurors, is contained in Cosby's own words, excerpted from a civil deposition he gave as a part of Constand's civil lawsuit in federal court. In it, Cosby says he does not remember ever asking Constand for permission before he carried out sex acts on her in his Cheltenham mansion in early 2004.\n\"You knew that it wasn't consensual because of his words,\" Feden said. \"You know it wasn't consensual because of the pattern. The MO,\" she said, referring to Cosby's alleged modus operandi of drugging and molesting women. \"And you know it wasn't consensual because of the testimony of Andrea Constand.\"\nIn finishing up the government's closing, prosecutor M. Stewart Ryan picked up where Feden left off. He was interrupted a handful of times with objections from the defense team.\n\"I wonder what they're so worried about,\" Ryan replied after the fourth objection.\n\"I wonder what we'll have to correct,\" Bliss countered.\nJudge Steven O'Neill told both sides to settle down, reminding the court that he will address objections to closing statements later.\n\"Biggest highway robberies of all time\"\nEarlier, Cosby's lawyers told the jury in the entertainer's retrial that Constand is a \"pathological liar\" whose story of \"so-called assault\" is so replete with inconsistencies that it cannot be trusted.\n\"In a case like this, credibility becomes everything,\" defense attorney Tom Mesereau told the jury in closing arguments Tuesday morning. \"There's so many big lies, they get lost. The number of lies start to drown others out.\"\nFlipping through a PowerPoint presentation, Mesereau walked jurors through what he said are a dozen instances of Constand lying about her relationship with Cosby \u2014 and about what Mesereau described as her motive to milk Cosby for a financial settlement.\nHe pointed out discrepancies over things such as how long Constand had known Cosby; whether Constand had ever flirted with the comedian; and what he said were fibs about wearing a cashmere sweater Cosby gave her as a gift.\nThe nearly $3.4 million Constand received as part of a previously confidential civil settlement she reached with Cosby in 2006 was long the aim of Cosby's chief accuser, he told jurors.\n\"She took the money, ran with the money. Her mom got money, her father got money. They're all part of the settlement agreement,\" Mesereau said. \"It's one of the biggest highway robberies of all time.\"\nThe other women who confronted Cosby in court were driven by the desire for publicity and money, Cosby's defense lawyers said, taking direct aim at the #MeToo movement. Attorney Kathleen Bliss said \"mob rule is not due process,\" adding that the claims of more than 60 women who have accused Cosby of sexual misconduct have been tantamount to a \"lynching,\" or a \"witch hunt.\"\n\"When you join a movement based mostly on emotion and anger, you don't change a damn thing,\" Bliss told jurors. \"Questioning an accuser is not shaming a victim. Gut feelings are not rational decisions.\"\nFor more than two weeks, Cosby's defense has focused on the argument that Constand is a \"con artist\" who sought to extort Cosby for a payout. In closing arguments, however, lawyers harkened back to a point made repeatedly by his defense team during the entertainer's first trial in June 2017: that Constand was always romantically interested in Cosby.\nFor proof, Mesereau pointed to \"at least 100 calls\" Constand placed after the alleged assault in January 2004.\nConstand, who worked for Temple University's basketball team at the time, has said that the calls were about business, since Cosby was a powerful university trustee heavily involved with the school's sports teams.\n\"This is a personal, intimate relationship, not basketball,\" Mesereau said. \"Constand placed twice the number of calls than he did to her, demonstrating her pursuit of him.\"\nCamille Cosby, the entertainer's wife of more than five decades, made her first appearance Tuesday during the retrial. She walked up to her husband, kissed and embraced him. Wearing a bright yellow and orange dress, she took a seat in the first row and remained stoic throughout the proceeding.\nIn an unusual move, the defense team split the two-hour-long closing speech between Bliss and Mesereau.\nBliss reminded the jury about the defense team's star witness, Margo Jackson, a former colleague of Constand's who claims Constand confided that she wanted to fabricate a story of sexual assault in order to try to shake down a celebrity for money.\n\"You would've thought they would've done something to check her out,\" said Bliss, indicting that prosecutors ignored Jackson in their investigation. \"Who are you going to believe? A well-educated ... woman who works at Temple and who counsels students and has a background in psychology?\" Bliss asked the jury. \"Or Andrea Constand, who was running a pyramid scheme at the same time?\"\nBliss then spoke to the jury about Gianna Constand, the mother of the accuser, who testified in the case and played for the court a recording she made of Cosby apologizing, saying he would like to set up an educational fund for Constand as long as she maintained a 3.0 average.\n\"Yes, he feels badly. He's 30 years older than she is. He's got this mother accusing him, yelling at him, whatever she was doing,\" Bliss said. \"He's also worried about extortion.\"\nMesereau, after describing the high bar to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, delivered his final line to the jury of seven men and five women who will soon decide Cosby's fate.\n\"He must walk out of here free,\" Mesereau said. \"He's an 80-year-old man.

Nick Lisi in 2016, alleging that the high-ranking officer had harassed her and colleagues, publicly ridiculing his subordinates\u2019 personal lives and physical attributes.\nThe \u201chorrific and corrupt set of circumstances,\u201d as Sgt. Nicole Whiteway describes the incident in her July 2017 complaint, are part of what she calls a campaign of harassment against her by a Durham police inspector and other officers.\nThe group of officers then told the suicidal man \u2014 the female officer\u2019s ex-husband \u2014 that he \u201cbetter be \u2018solid\u2019 and not tell anyone about what had happened,\u201d the complaint alleges.\nInstead, the officers interrogated him in an attempt to find some dirt on a female sergeant who had lodged complaints about a senior officer\u2019s abusive and misogynistic behaviour, according to allegations filed in an internal police complaint.\nThe Durham police officers said they would take the mentally unstable man to the hospital. He was suicidal and needed to see a doctor.\nAccording to a memo signed by a Durham deputy chief, an external investigator had substantiated some of the allegations contained in Whiteway\u2019s first complaint while dismissing others as embellished, false or malicious. The memo said the investigator\u2019s specific findings are confidential, and they have not been publicly released.\nLisi told the Star the allegations against him are untrue. \u201cThe information you have is erroneous and incorrect,\u201d he said.\nShe alleges that Lisi made derogatory comments about her ex-husband\u2019s mental health and derided her for seeking an accommodated schedule to care for her young son, who has a life-threatening health condition.\nDurham police said it would dock Lisi 160 hours pay, according to the memo. Durham police sources say Lisi has refused to accept the penalty, and the matter is expected to go to a public disciplinary hearing.\nThe alleged incident with the suicidal man happened this past spring, while Whiteway\u2019s original workplace harassment complaint was still being reviewed.\nHer July complaint to Durham police is now being investigated by the force\u2019s professional standards unit. The allegations have not been proven.\nOn April 21, Whiteway called Durham police in a panic. Her ex-husband was taking care of their daughter for the weekend, and he was threatening to commit suicide, her complaint says. (The Star is not naming the ex-husband because of his mental health. His lawyer did not respond to requests for comment.)\nDurham officers eventually found the man and his daughter in his truck on a rural highway. The daughter returned home with Whiteway. Meanwhile, the officers told Whiteway that they had arrested her ex-husband under the Mental Health Act and would take him to a hospital in Oshawa to be evaluated, her complaint alleges.\nWhen she spoke with the officers later, her complaint says, she was told she couldn\u2019t speak with her ex because he was seeing a doctor.\nBut the officers only took the man to the hospital parking lot, she alleges.\n\u201cIt was explained to him that this was just being done because the police cars have GPS and the police officers dealing with him needed a record to show that they were at the hospital if ever questioned about the incident,\u201d her complaint says.\nThe man was grilled about his ex-wife\u2019s personal life, Whiteway\u2019s complaint alleges.\n\u201c(He) was mistreated and threatened in order to manufacture evidence to discredit me as an officer which I believe is related to my complaint against Inspector Nick Lisi,\u201d her complaint says.\nThe complaint does not indicate that Lisi was among the officers that allegedly interrogated her ex-husband.\nShe alleges that after as many as 2\u00bd hours, the officers took the man back to his truck and told him \u201che better be \u2018solid\u2019 and not tell anyone about what had happened.\u201d\nWhiteway\u2019s complaint says that the hospital could not find any admission records for her ex from the night of the incident.\nWhiteway is now on stress leave. She would not speak to the Star out of fear she would be disciplined by the police force, said her lawyer, Peter Brauti.\n\u201cWe want to see accountability of people who weren\u2019t doing their job. We want to see accountability of people who may have behaved in a corrupt manner,\u201d Brauti said.\n\u201cWe want to see transparency. We want to be told what Durham police are doing about this.\u201d\nWhiteway\u2019s ex-husband has also filed a complaint about the incident with the Office of the Independent Police Review Director, a civilian police oversight agency, Brauti said.\nBrauti said he has asked Durham police to let the agency investigate Whiteway\u2019s complaint.\n\u201cThe complete lack of trust demands that an outside agency look at this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a problem with the police policing themselves.\u201d"}

{"id":"c0aedd8a-cc6c-431d-ab6a-c29c92eba51f","text":"JPM might be worth considering as an investment, if it can continue to grow revenues and clear its recent high at $94.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) is a well-known corporation that provides investment and financial services to individuals, governments, and businesses around the world. Its stock has been on a tear lately thanks to the Trump rally. It even made a new all-time high earlier this year. But lately it's been moving sideways, and even sliding down a little within that sideways action. That's largely because JPMorgan Chase's revenues have been largely flat, which puts the stock at risk of a top. JPMorgan Chase must find a way to grow revenues again in order to avoid a topping action and reversal for its stock.\nJPMorgan Chase's Stock Charts Warn of a Potential Top\nThe weekly chart for JPM shows that it started moving up strongly in November of 2016 at the start of the Trump rally. It jumped up quickly last November, and then trended up more slowly as the Trump rally carried it to new highs. It reached a new all-time high on March 1st, 2017. The stock was highly speculated as traders expected incoming President Trump's policies to benefit big banks. But those expectations haven't come to fruition yet. The stock has moved in a sideways pattern since then.\nFigure 1: Weekly Chart of JPM. Chart provided by FreeStockCharts.com.\nThe daily chart for JPM shows that the stock has drifted down over the past few weeks. Red volume bars have dominated, both in size and number. There are also a few red volume spikes showing that high frequency traders moved in to drive the stock down. The black down-day candles are much larger than the white up-days. The trend is also forming lower highs and lower lows. Overall this pattern looks weaker as sellers have taken control. No doubt many investors decided to take profits at the recent all-time high, and not enough buyers are moving in to hold the price up.\nFigure 2: Daily chart of JPM. Chart provided by FreeStockCharts.com.\nLet's check a few indicators to see if they confirm what we see in the candlestick charts. Wilder's Relative Strength Index (RSI) has steadily fallen over the past month, confirming the weakening price action. Stochastics has formed lower highs and lows over the pest few weeks as well, further confirming the weakening of price. It also formed a much lower peak a few days ago as the %K and %D lines crossed back over to the downside.\nFigure 3: Wilder's RSI and Stochastics indicators. Chart provided by FreeStockCharts.com.\nThe charts show that sellers are currently in control of JPM. Right now it's just profit taking, but it could turn into a topping action if buyers don't' move back in. We can expect a stronger move down if JPM breaches the $83 level and hits stop losses.\nJPMorgan Chase's Fundamentals Show Some Possible Improvement\nNow let's check the fundamentals of JPM to see if they match what we see in the charts. A quick look at Nasdaq.com shows that JPM's earnings have been flat over the past four quarters, which could account for why JPM has moved sideways since March. JPM has kept expenses pretty flat, which has helped its financial results. The income statement also shows that JPM's income has risen steadily over the past year, which is a divergence from price. Income and revenues should move together, and the fact that they aren't is another sign of a possible top. It's likely that the CFO has capitalized some expenses in order to make the net income numbers look better. But we'd have to comb through the accounting numbers confirm this.\nFigure 4: Income statement for JPM. Data provided by Nasdaq.com.\nJPM also has a large amount of long-term debt, which can slow its growth. It's debt load is holding steady, though, and is actually dropping a little.\nFigure 5: Balance sheet for JPM. Data provided by Nasdaq.com.\nBut the 4th quarter 2016 earnings did beat estimates, which is a good sign. The CEO's commentary in this earnings report was very positive but a bit vague. The report also didn't give any solid guidance, which is a little odd. CEO Jamie Dimon stated, \"We grew market share in virtually all of our businesses and showed expense discipline while continuing to invest for the future. Building upon our strong new product offerings, we continue to deepen relationships with U.S. households and continue to achieve high customer satisfaction scores.\" So overall the JPM leadership expected the 1st quarter results to improve.\nJPMorgan Chase's Latest Earnings Results\nJPMorgan Chase just released their 1st earnings report, so let's see how they did. Analysts expected earnings of $1.51 per share on revenues of $24.6 billion. But JPM beat estimates, with earnings of $1.65 on revenues of $24.7 billion. Revenues increased year over and year and quarter over quarter. Net Income also improved year over year, but fell compared to last quarter. This is partially due to increasing expenses. Once again JPM neglected to give detailed guidance for next quarter. JPM's leadership did give some clues though. The earnings presentation stated that net interest income will rise $400 million next quarter. That alone should boost revenues and earnings for the 2nd quarter.\nThe CEO stated, \"We are off to a good start for the year with all of our businesses performing well and building on their momentum from last year. The consumer businesses continue to grow core loans at double digits, outperform the industry in deposit growth, and we once again had very strong card sales volume growth this quarter - reflecting our commitment to providing our customers the innovative products and services they want.\" It sounds like JPM's management expects the company to continue to do well for the rest of the year. If they manage to meet their expectations, it could stave off the stock top. The increasing revenues and income would justify the higher stock price for investors.\nOutlook and Risk\nJPM's stock chart is weak and it's fundamentals diverged in 2016. Usually these are clear signs of a top. But its most recent earnings report shows some improvement. If the company can continue to grow its revenues and earnings, its stock can avoid a top and resume its uptrend. The company must also control expenses so that net income can continue to improve quarter over quarter.\nJPM is still a risky investment, however, until it can show that it can continue to grow its earnings and move up beyond its all time high. It isn't safe to enter until it moves up and sustains above $94. Expect more downside action if earnings don't improve enough to draw buyers back, especially if it falls below the $83 level. At the point the top will complete and stock will likely be in free fall. There won't be much to slow the downtrend until it reaches the sideways pattern at $70.\nSo right now JPM shows some promise, but hold off investing in it until it clears it's all-time high. You don't want to get in a topping stock that ends up dropping like a rock.\nDisclosure: I\/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

With that much time between the conclusion of that game and Super Bowl LII, the hope was that most of the injuries would heal up and that the majority of the roster would be in playing shape to face the Philadelphia Eagles.\nLittle did anyone expect for the New England Patriots to have a Super Bowl injury report without a single player listed.\nThat\u2019s right. For the first time all season, the Pats have not a single person listed on their injury report as late on Friday afternoon; they\u2019ve removed every single player. Earlier in the week, there were a handful of names on it and some who were dealing with some rather serious issues, but everything seems to have been cleared up.\nEarlier in the week, the Patriots had four players listed on the injury report and all of them have healed up in the exact same timeframe. They were limited in practice on Wednesday, practiced in full for the first time on Thursday, and were completely removed from the list as of Friday.\nThe biggest name was obviously that of tight end Rob Gronkowski, who suffered a concussion after taking a very hard hit to the helmet against the Jacksonville Jaguars. On Tuesday, Gronk said that he was feeling much better and he expected to be cleared and removed from the NFL\u2019s concussion protocol at any moment, but Wednesday came and went without change.\nThis brought about a bit of concern as the Super Bowl was drawing ever closer and the Patriots knew that playing without Gronk was becoming a bigger possibility. On Thursday, though, the star tight end was cleared and participated fully in Thursday\u2019s practice.\nOne of the other big worries of New England coaches was cornerback Malcolm Butler, who was battling an illness that came with flu-like symptoms. It was actually quite serious and he did not fly out to Minnesota with his teammates on Monday, as he didn\u2019t want to get any of them sick. He stayed behind in Massachusetts and went to the hospital a number of times, but he was never admitted overnight. By Wednesday, Butler was practicing in a limited capacity and ready to go full-speed on Thursday.\nDefensive back Brandon King (knee) and defensive lineman Deatrich Wise (concussion) were the other two players on the injury report at the beginning of the week, but they also improved enough to practice fully on Thursday. On Friday, they were practicing at full-speed once again and removed from the injury report.\nIt is quite unheard of for an NFL team to have an empty injury report at any point in a season, and that includes Week 1. Still, here are the New England Patriots with a clean slate and a totally healthy team as they prepare to face the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII on Sunday.\nOut:\nNone\nDoubtful\nNone\nQuestionable\nNone\nProbable"}

By GULSHAN KHAN (AFP)\nOnderstepoort (South Africa) (AFP) - Peeling back the maize plant's leaves reveals a small brown caterpillar -- an armyworm that writhes as it burrows into the heart of the crop, producing a sticky dark paste.\nEighty percent of the Prinsloo family's maize plants are under attack, as are those of other farmers in Haakdoringboom, a farming community 20 kilometres (12 miles) north of South Africa's capital Pretoria.\n\"These worms are eating everything that they touch,\" said farmer Jacques Prinsloo, who held up a damaged leaf to demonstrate the alarming speed at which the fall armyworms devour the crop.\nLeaves are shredded and residue speckles the inside of the plants -- a tell-tale sign of trouble.\nThe recently-arrived pests, which are proving immune to existing pesticides, are devastating crops and threatening southern Africa's fragile food supply having spread through Zambia and Zimbabwe as well as South Africa.\nMalawi, Mozambique and Namibia are also reported to be affected by the worms.\nThey originate from South America and are thought to have arrived in Africa in shipments of plants or on commercial airliners, with the first fall armyworms in Africa seen in Nigeria and Togo last year.\n\"I tried everything on the market. I spent 45,000 rand ($3,400) on pesticides alone,\" said Jacques, 24, who has been battling the pests for six weeks.\n\"Last year the drought, this year the worms, what next year? Everyone thinks it's easy to farm. It seems easy until you start doing it.\"\nJacques estimates that as many as four in five of his maize plants are affected.\n'We're fighting'\nArmyworm caterpillars eat the kernels of a cob of corn\nIf the crop fails entirely, he estimates it will cost his family up to 700,000 rand ($53,000) this year alone.\nCrops in neighbouring farmers' fields are also being ravaged by the pests, according to Adele who, along with her son Jacques, employs six staff on their roughly 100 hectare farm.\n\"We're fighting. The farm next door to us is fighting,\" said Adele.\nAcross southern Africa, fall armyworms are wreaking havoc with staple crops for the first time.\nKey food sources like maize, wheat, millet and rice have all come under attack, raising fears of imminent mass food shortages.\nNearly 40 million people in southern Africa have been affected a two-year-long drought caused by the El Nino climate phenomenon reducing food availability by 15 percent, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).\nDavid Phiri, the FAO's coordinator for southern Africa, warned experts at a crisis summit in Harare this week that the armyworm poses \"a huge threat to food security\".\n'Hopeless, angry, heartbroken'\nSouth African farmers are desperate for help to fight the armyworm pest\nDespite their proximity to South Africa's seat of power, the Prinsloos feel that their plight, and that of hundreds of other farmers, is being ignored by the government.\n\"I'm feeling hopeless, angry, heartbroken -- it feels like I could go and sit and cry myself to death,\" said 50-year-old Adele who has been involved in farming for nearly half her life.\n\"All the money and effort that's been put in there and I'm getting no help.\n\"We were promised a visit by the farming minister on Sunday but they cancelled. Nobody is doing anything. They said they would import a poison from abroad but we've heard nothing.\"\nThe region around the Prinsloo farm had only just begun to recover from one of the worst dry spells in recent history when the armyworms struck.\n\"A year ago we had the drought but then we had good rains. Now the worms are destroying the crop,\" said Adele.\nIn one badly affected field, nearly every plant is showing signs of damage.\nLooking out over his family's fields, bordered by tracks of rich red earth and criss-crossed with mechanical irrigation systems, Jacques is doubtful there will be a quick solution to the crisis.\n\"(The plants) are not going to make corn because of the damage,\" he said of this year's crop. \"The larvae is making new worms and you must fight them again. Burning it might be the only option.\""}

Because of GDPR, which became enforceable Friday, any business or entity that operates in the EU or provides services to EU citizens \u2014 including some brick-and-mortar retailers \u2014is now required to provide users with a way to access their own data, as well as information about when their data is being collected and how to delete their data if they so choose.\nPeople in the U.S. get to reap many of these benefits, too, like being able to download your data and being notified when there\u2019s a breach, but GDPR\u2019s ripple effect has an additional benefit: motivating U.S. lawmakers and other groups to get serious about similar regulations stateside.\nEnter the California Consumer Privacy Act. If successful, the ballot initiative \u2014 first drafted in November and submitted May 3 with about 625,000 signatures \u2014 would give consumers greater control over their personal information.\nAccording to a summary of the proposal, consumers would have the right to know what kind of personal information businesses are collecting about them; the entities to which their information is sold or disclosed; and the right to prevent businesses from sharing said data. The proposed legislation also calls for civil penalties for businesses who fail to adhere to its regulations and would allow consumers to sue businesses for data breaches.\n\u201cYou have the right to tell a business not to share or sell your personal information,\u201d the website reads. \u201cYou have the right to know where and to whom your data is being sold.\u201d\nThe proposed bill was crafted by Californians for Consumer Privacy.\n\u201cWith GDPR, once a company gets consent from a user it\u2019s business as usual, not much is going to change,\u201d Alastair Mactaggart, the group\u2019s campaign chair, said in a phone interview.\nThough GDPR benefits consumers globally, internet users may not be able to rely on Europe to fight everyone\u2019s privacy battles.\n\u201cThe protections that GDPR offers, when it comes to U.S. consumers, are offered voluntarily by the company,\u201d Neema Singh Guliani, legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, said in an interview. \u201cEven though GDPR provides benefits globally, it doesn\u2019t eliminate the need for privacy law in the U.S. or the need for an apparatus to ensure that if a customer is not given a right, that they can take [a company] to court.\u201d\nThe California proposal is different from GDPR in that it would require more transparency from companies on how consumers\u2019 data is utilized and shared.\nThis isn\u2019t the only bill in the works that emphasizes consumer privacy. Federal lawmakers have introduced legislation like the CONSENT Act and the Social Media Privacy Protection and Consumer Rights Act, both of which are aimed at establishing data and privacy protections.\nMactaggart noted that California often establishes precedent when it comes to progressive lawmaking in the U.S., pointing to car emission standards as one example. \u201cIf this passes in California, it will pass in the rest of the country,\u201d Mactaggart said.\nAccording to Singh Guliani, pressure is mounting for the U.S. to catch up to Europe. \u201cThere\u2019s a greater sense of urgency given what\u2019s come out over the past several months, and given what laws other countries adopt in response,\u201d he said.\nPrior to GDPR, most of the privacy heat has fallen on Facebook with regard to the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the social media giant\u2019s overall business model. But companies like Google and even online quiz providers are also guilty of collecting similar data. The enforcement of GDPR \u2014 and the deluge of privacy update emails it spawned \u2014 have placed an even greater spotlight on online privacy.\nIn this post-GDPR world, it\u2019s worth noting that some lawmakers have previously made attempts to enact data and privacy protections \u2014 with little success. Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Ill.), for example, reintroduced the Data Accountability and Trust Act back in 2011, while former Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) tried to garner support for the Commercial Privacy Bill of Rights Act that same year. The Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights, an initiative introduced by the Obama administration in 2012, did relatively little to keep the privacy of internet users intact.\nA Republican-controlled Congress rolled back those protections in 2017.\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act focuses on similar provisions that would prioritize the protection of consumer privacy. However, the recent surge of public concern over privacy issues help these measures pass.\n\u201cThis is something people are focused on more than they were two years ago, thanks to Cambridge Analytica,\u201d Mactaggart said. \u201cOur initiative skips [the] legislature and goes straight to the voters, so everything that makes voters more aware of the lack of control they have over their own data helps.\u201d\nMactaggart also addressed the fact that tech and innovation often move faster than lawmakers. \u201cHow do you make a law in 2018 that\u2019s still relevant in 2025?\u201d Mactaggart said.\nThe answer to this, he said, is in a particular section of the California Consumer Privacy Act that reads: \u201cThe attorney general may adopt additional regulations as necessary to further the purposes of this act.\u201d This would allow the state\u2019s attorney general to update the act as necessary as new technology emerges.\nFuture-proofing a privacy bill is nearly impossible, but letting the right people make a judgement call offers a good start. The other option: a foundation of baseline rights crafted using common sense.\n\u201cTechnology is moving faster than the laws that can govern it, and it\u2019s tough to predict what laws we may need next,\u201d Singh Guliani said. \u201cThings like user consent, transparency and data portability are very important for users. It won\u2019t solve every issue, but it\u2019s a necessary piece of every legislation.\u201d"}

But the fact the Seahawks brought Kaepernick in for a visit was worthy of acknowledgement considering the silence he's received from the rest of the NFL, Bennett said.\n\"I don't know what the factors were in (why) the Seahawks didn't sign him,\" Bennett said. \"I know the Seahawks were the only team to step up and give him an opportunity to do a (visit). That says a lot about the organization. I think our organization is built a lot around community.\n\"If you look at the way the Seahawks move, if you look at the way our team moves, if you look at the people that work in the building this organization is built around community. I'm not surprised that the Seahawks were one to look at Kaepernick and give him an opportunity even to try out.\"\nBennett was in full support of his franchise on Wednesday during the second day of Seattle's minicamp, from his praise for considering Kaepernick to coach Pete Carroll's reasoning why the Seahawks didn't sign the quarterback.\n\"If he feels that this is not the right situation because we have a starting quarterback, then that's his choice,\" Bennett said. \"I think he's able to have that choice because he's shown that he's of a winning pedigree. He wants to make sure he doesn't have that competition behind his quarterback, I think it's justifiable.\"\nBennett skipped Seattle's OTAs earlier in the off-season , working out on his own and spending time with his family, but didn't want to risk any fines for missing the mandatory minicamp. Bennett also said Wednesday he's been in contact with Kaepernick through the off-season in an attempt to help the former San Francisco quarterback with some of his initiatives.\nNever one to hold back an opinion, Bennett said there is no logical explanation for why Kaepernick doesn't have a job at this point.\n\"There is obviously the elephant in the room why Kaepernick isn't signed,\" Bennett said. \"I've said this several times and I'm not afraid to say it, I think race in politics and sports is something that people don't want to hear about, nor do people want to be a part of.\n\"I think if you bring the issue of oppressed people onto a stage where there's millions of fans watching, bring up dirty little secrets, I think a lot of people don't want to hear that.

Among the items Student Body Armor offers are bulletproof T-shirts.\nThe campaign by Cocks not Glocks, named after dildo-themed protests against campus gun carry protests held last year, hopes to attract the attention of high school students who are mulling over which college to choose.\n\u201cDon\u2019t get caught in the crossfire. Get student body armor,\u201d boasts a video created by advertising agency FCB New York, which notes that nine states allow \u201cvirtually anyone with a license\u201d to bring a gun onto school grounds.\nCocks Not Glocks: Texas students carry dildos on campus to protest gun law Read more\nWith clothes dubbed \u201ca proprietary blend of Type II body armor and school pride\u201d, it is a ridiculous way of making a serious point \u2013 much like the Cocks Not Glocks demonstration last August at the University of Texas at Austin, when activists distributed thousands of dildos as a critique of Texas\u2019s new law allowing licence-holders aged 21 and over to carry concealed handguns in most places at public higher education institutions.\nThe aim was to highlight the perceived absurdity of rules that make brandishing sex toys potentially illegal, while the state\u2019s Republican-dominated legislature has given its blessing to young people attending classes or entering a dorm room with a holstered revolver.\nIt is about \u201cabsurd branding that makes people just slow down for a second and question what they value as acceptable in day-to-day life\u201d, said Jessica Jin, a former University of Texas student who founded Cocks Not Glocks.\nIn addition to the nine states that generally allow concealed weapons on public higher education campuses, there are 23 others that allow individual institutions to make their own decisions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\nAmid Republican success in many statewide elections in recent years, the number of states that allow some form of campus carry is growing: it will come into effect in Arkansas in September, while a bill in Georgia is awaiting a decision from the governor, Nathan Deal, who vetoed similar legislation last year.\n\u201cThey just keep popping up like Whac-A-Mole, state after state, and we have to stay super-vigilant about this,\u201d Jin said.\nThe liberal-leaning Austin campus has been the epicentre of resistance to the Texas law, which expands to include community colleges from 1 August. Private universities can opt out and almost all are opposed.\nGun-Free UT, an anti-campus carry group, has compiled a list of 21 prospective or current faculty members, students, guest speakers and performers who have left or decided not to attend Texas campuses because of the law, which critics say risks harming safety, discouraging recruitment and provoking intimidation that will stifle the free and frank exchange of ideas.\nProponents argue that license-holders should be allowed to exercise their constitutional right to bear arms on a campus just as they can elsewhere, that only a small number of students are likely to be carrying and that security and free-speech concerns are exaggerated.\nA Houston Chronicle examination of the first six months of the law found three firearm discharges on Texas college campuses last fall: a suicide at the University of Houston, three shots fired at Texas Tech University without injury or property damage and the accidental firing of a gun in a dorm room at Tarleton State University by a licensed student which caused limited property damage.\n\u201cI think that campus carry is spreading across other states simply because people realise that you have an individual right to self-defence,\u201d said Brian Bensimon, a student at the University of Texas and regional director for Students For Concealed Carry. \u201cIf you have an area nearby, let\u2019s say it\u2019s a grocery store or a restaurant, that does allow concealed carry\u2026 what is so qualitatively different about the college campus that you can\u2019t allow it there?\u201d\nProfessors sue University of Texas and state attorney over campus carry laws Read more\nGun rights on campus may be significantly enhanced if the Texas legislature passes a so-called \u201cconstitutional carry\u201d bill under consideration that would allow the open carrying of guns without a permit.\nFor Jin, the matter goes beyond any statistical analysis of risks and frequency of incidents. \u201cI think the issue is the normalization of violence. Rather than actually taking any serious steps towards addressing why students are so scared to go to school every day without a gun, we\u2019re just talking about creating more violence, which is not a transformative or restorative solution whatsoever,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re going to continue to do with Cocks Not Glocks is go wherever this legislation goes and say hey, students, do you want to be part of a movement that is here to change the narrative around the culture of this \u2018guns everywhere\u2019 society, a society that expects violence in day to day situations? Like, should you go to class expecting violence? Should you go to class expecting to witness violence? And is that something we\u2019re OK with?

That doesn\u2019t mean he gets to script the end of his football career.\nAnd with each passing week, chances of him re-signing with the Chargers appear increasingly slim. General Manager Tom Telesco said Monday that the team has not been in recent contact with Gates, an unrestricted free agent who is less than two months away from his 38th birthday.\n\u201cI understand it\u2019s a big topic,\u201d Telesco said. \u201cI just don\u2019t have an update on it right now.\u201d\nThe Chargers met with Gates\u2019 representatives at the NFL scouting combine in early March, but even then, Telesco was non-committal about a potential reunion: \u201cThere are so many moving parts in free agency,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got some things to talk over.\u201d\nThose talks apparently haven\u2019t progressed, despite Gates\u2019 professed desire to extend his playing career. The 15-year veteran holds the all-time record for NFL tight ends with 114 regular-season touchdown catches, three of which he added last year. After catching four passes for 46 yards on New Year\u2019s Eve, he told reporters: \u201cI still got the juice.\u201d\nBut at what cost? Gates earned $5 million last season, and hasn\u2019t netted less than $4.5 million in any given year since 2009. Meanwhile, Hunter Henry \u2014 one of the NFL\u2019s best young tight ends \u2014 is set to earn just over $1 million in base salary in his third season with the Chargers. The franchise also signed veteran Virgil Green, a blocking tight end who has caught for 601 yards in the last three years, in March.\nIf the Chargers further supplement the depth chart in this week\u2019s NFL draft, retaining Gates might signal more sentimentality than practicality.\nEven Philip Rivers \u2014 whose 87 touchdown passes to Gates represents the league record for a quarterback-tight end duo \u2014 acknowledged the possibility that they might not connect on the field again.\n\u201cYou\u2019d love for him to get one more shot to be with us and go make a run at it,\u201d Rivers said last week. \u201cLike we\u2019ve said every year, \u2018This is going to be the year.\u2019 But who knows? If it were not to work out, and if he were to decide to hang it up, who knows? He\u2019s had a heck of a run. He has nothing left to prove, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\nMAYFIELD\u2019S FULL PLATE\nBaker Mayfield will probably not be available when the Chargers draft at No. 17 overall \u2014 not as the reigning Heisman winner entering a league hungry for talented quarterbacks. In fact, the former Oklahoma star won\u2019t even bother pretending otherwise.\nIn an interview with Sports Illustrated\u2019s The MMQB published last week, Mayfield admitted that he didn\u2019t do everything possible to prepare for a March meeting with Chargers staffers.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t look at their playbook as much as a I should have,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could have gone a little bit better \u2026 but at the same time, I\u2019m prioritizing which playbooks I\u2019m going to learn. No offense to them, but I\u2019ve got a lot on my plate.\u201d\nAsked on Monday about Mayfield\u2019s comments, Telesco smiled: \u201cI\u2019m probably not prepared to comment on that. My plate\u2019s pretty full. No offense.\u201d\nThe Chargers are committed to Rivers as their starting quarterback, but have not ruled out drafting his eventual successor. Telesco has traded up in three drafts since joining the Chargers in 2013, and contemplated doing so again last year to get Western Kentucky offensive lineman Forrest Lamp \u2014 who eventually fell to the team anyway at No. 38 overall.\nPLAYER RETENTION\nReceiver Tyrell Williams signed his second-round tender on Monday morning, which will pay him $2.914 million this upcoming season. The deadline for another NFL team to sign restricted free agents to offer sheets passed last Friday.\nHowever, the move doesn\u2019t guarantee that Williams will remain in Southern California through the upcoming season. Fellow wideout Dontrelle Inman also signed his second-round tender with the Chargers a year ago, but was traded to Chicago in October.\nTelesco also said that the Chargers plan to pick up Melvin Gordon\u2019s fifth-year option, which would keep the running back on their roster for $5.6 million in 2019. Gordon played a full 16-game slate for the first time last fall, and set a career high with 1,105 rushing yards."}

The exhibition will be showcased at 24e and run from Thursday, May 18 until Sunday, June 25.Showcasing different fine art works such as drawings, paintings, sculptures and mixed media pieces, this art exhibition will be a rare opportunity to view Cone's work as he does not often publicly show his art. Proceeds from the event will benefit the Curtis and Elizabeth Anderson Cancer Institute (ACI) at Memorial University Medical Center. ACI provides cancer screening, diagnosis, surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, support services, and long-term follow-up for cancer patients.Cone has been creating art for over 40 years, but after a recent bout with cancer, he has been energized with creativity and decided he wanted to use his talent to help others.Ruel Joyner, owner of 24e Design Co., has known Cone for a number of years and feels honored to showcase his work at 24e Design Co., calling Cone's work a pure form of passion. \"Jim has painted for pleasure for over four decades. He started his artistic works in his spare time while working a full-time job at Georgia Power, and after his cancer he really focused on his talents. In a way, Dr. Guy Petruzzelli and the professional staff at Memorial gave him a new lease on life, and presented him with a new creative chapter in his life after cancer.\"At the exhibit, somewhere between 100 and 150 pieces will be unveiled including, \"Tybee Nudes\" and \"Street People\". Street People, a series of paintings, was inspired by a found object (a round piece of metal) from the streets of Savannah, which had been bent into a shape that portrayed the image of a face. There are 20-plus \"Street People\" in the series to date.\"I offer the 'Street People' series as an artful way to introduce the viewer to a personality of a person living on the streets,\" said Cone. \"I want you to really see that person as an individual and feel that person's struggle. We should all be inspired in our hearts to reach out and help the homeless street people in our community.\"In his distinctive style, and with vibrant colors, Cone pushes cubism forward. Considered to be the first abstract style of modern art, Cubist artists try to piece together fragments from different vantage points into one painting. With the spirit of inclusion, one can see the incorporation of cubism in almost all of Cone's artwork. The bold expression of color often separates and defines Cone's cubist works from those cubist works by others like Picasso and Braque.Cone said, \"For me, there needs to be a perfect mixture of creative energy, thought and muse, along with colorful paint, and countless brush strokes onto a wanting canvas, all to bring about a wonderful work of art. It's making creative love.\"For more information on the Anderson Cancer Institute, visit aci.memorialhealth.comFor more information and to see samples of the artwork, visit https:\/\/conecollection.com To make a reservation for the May 18th art reception, visit https:\/\/www.conecollection.com\/ contact ABOUT CONE COLLECTIONJim Cone began painting in the mid-'70s and works mostly with oil on canvas, often embellishing each piece with found objects such as paper, wood and metal.

After that, the report details how he supposedly held her tight, groped her and rubbed himself up against her.\n\"All the things he did to me were so wrong,\" the victim said in bond court Friday. \"I never want anyone to have to experience the same things.\"\nSeveral people showed up in support of both the defendant and the alleged victim.\n\"He has never been in trouble before,\" Buchen's attorney Alex Toporek said in court today. \"He has absolutely zero criminal record.\"\nThe new bond comes after he was booked in jail earlier this month and accused of sexually assaulting two of his students. The bond concerning the preliminary charges was set at $300,000 on charges of second-degree sexual conduct with a minor and third-degree sexual conduct with a minor.\nA background check on Buchen revealed that prior to the previous sexual assault accusations from two weeks ago, his record was clean.\nThat's why former teaching partner of eight years Justin Watchendorf was so surprised.\n\"I believe their integrity and I would never believe them to make up anything,\" Watchendorf said. \"Their pain was going through my mind.\nPreviously released court documents show Buchen acknowledged that it was inappropriate to massage one of the victims. According to authorities, one victim said she was intimidated by Buchen and afraid to tell anyone what happened to her.\nDee Norton Child Advocacy Center executive director Carole Swiecicki said there are several signs parents should watch out for in regards to incidents of assault.\n\"Parents can look for changes in their child's behavior as a possible sign that the child has experienced abuse,\" Swiecicki. \"If they were happy and kind of enjoyed going to an activity, and suddenly they're seeming much more withdrawn and sad and now wanting to go, changes in those behaviors can be an indicator to the parent that something has happened.\"\nSwiecicki also said parents should understand that sometimes the only sign parents can pick up on is the child telling them.\nIf your child suffers from a case of abuse, Swiecicki recommended you contact the Dee Norton center. She said the center has programs and resources that can help children and their families during difficult times.\nCopyright 2018 WCSC. All rights reserved."}

Boakai, by appearing to make overtures to Liberty Party's Charles Brumskine and even Coalition for Democratic Change standard bearer George Weah.\nThe surprising thing with the latter is that the most compelling reason voters in 2005 cast their votes in favor of Ellen in the presidential run-off was her overwhelming education and experience contrasted to Weah's who, though a very popular football superstar, was no match to a Harvard graduate and a former government of Liberia, World Bank, Citibank and United Nations senior official.\nWhat is the difference today seems to be the usual, the trump card in her presidency that begins with capital 'R'--meaning Robert.\nTuesday's vote is an important democratic right that all duly registered voters are expected to exercise. We must do so with the utmost seriousness, clarity of vision, determination to move our country forward, and patriotism. As we go to the polls, let us first decide who will be that person who, as President of Liberia, has the integrity, the love of country and the wherewithal to lift our country and usher her into the modern age.\nOnce we decide who that person will be, let us give him\/her our fullest support so that the win will be overwhelmingly convincing that no one will dare cry foul.\nHere we must once again caution ALL party representatives at each polling station not to sleep, but to be vigilant on their assignments and watch EVERYTHING taking place, for there is where the vote casting and the initial counting will take place. These representatives will be ultimately responsible to vet all the votes cast and ensure that there is absolutely NO hocus pocus or foul play, but that accountability, credibility and transparency will prevail and that the reports from EACH voting precinct will be AGREED upon before transmission to the central hub at the NEC in Monrovia.\nThere, too, all the parties will be represented and we are calling on these party and independent candidate representatives to exercise eternal vigilance and be part of every decision that is to be made.\nThe effectiveness of these party and independent candidate representatives is the fulcrum (hinge, axis) on which the free, fair and transparent elections will be based. This is the determining factor on which the peaceful elections rest.\nSo, representatives at each polling station and at the NEC headquarters on Tuesday night and subsequently, the responsibility is on your shoulders to ensure that the National Elections Commission conducts credible elections. Anything you suspect to be amiss must cause you to immediately announce and document the error; and follow the procedures as outlined in the NEC regulations for correction.\nIt is, therefore, in your hands, party and independent candidate representatives, that credibility, transparency, yea, the peacefulness of these elections rest."}

The committee said the organization \"has been a driving force in prevailing upon the world's nations to pledge to cooperate ... in efforts to stigmatize, prohibit and eliminate nuclear weapons.\"\nThe prize \"sends a message to all nuclear-armed states and all states that continue to rely on nuclear weapons for security that it is unacceptable behavior. We will not support it, we will not make excuses for it, we can't threaten to indiscriminately slaughter hundreds of thousands of civilians in the name of security. That's not how you build security,\" ICAN executive director Beatrice Fihn told reporters in Geneva. She said that she \"worried that it was a prank\" after getting a phone call just minutes before the official Peace Prize announcement was made. Fihn said she didn't believe it until she heard the name of the group proclaimed on television. \"We are trying to send very strong signals to all states with nuclear arms, nuclear-armed states \u2013 North Korea, U.S., Russia, China, France, U.K., Israel, all of them, India, Pakistan \u2013 it is unacceptable to threaten to kill civilians,\" she said. The prize comes amid heightened tensions over both North Korea's aggressive development of nuclear weapons and President Donald Trump's persistent criticism of the deal to curb Iran's nuclear program. \"The panel wants to send a signal to North Korea and the US that they need to go into negotiations. The prize is also coded support to the Iran nuclear deal. I think this was wise because recognizing the Iran deal itself could have been seen as giving support to the Iranian state,\" Oeivind Stenersen, a historian of the peace prize, told The Associated Press. Reiss-Andersen noted that similar prohibitions have been reached on chemical and biological weapons, land mines and cluster munitions. \"Nuclear weapons are even more destructive, but have not yet been made the object of a similar international legal prohibition,\" she said.\nICAN is one of those earnest, well meaning do-gooder organizations with lofty goals but a deficient concept of reality. Take as an example the operators' belief that \"chemical and biological weapons, land mines and cluster munitions\" have all been banned. Residents of several towns and cities in Syria would dispute the notion that chemical and bio weapons have been disappeared via treaty. There are plenty of African countries that still use land mines, and cluster bombs are still being manufactured. To believe that a piece of paper will stop a tyrant like Bashar Assad from using chemical weapons is criminally stupid. It gives some people a false sense of security, and it gives organizations like ICAN a Nobel Peace Prize despite their utter failure to achieve anything.\nThat includes ridding the world of nuclear weapons. The fact is, the nuclear genie has been out of the bottle since 1945. Building a bomb is actually fairly easy, although getting your hands on highly enriched uranium and developing a workable bomb design is more problematic. But as North Korea has proven, you don't have to be a first-world country to threaten the world. Obstacles can be overcome with enough money and determination.\nFor the sake of argument, let's say ICAN convinced the states armed with nuclear weapons to give them up. Does that mean that the threat of nuclear war is over? Hardly. ICAN does not mention the probability that international terrorist groups will one day possess nukes, and somehow, I don't think they're going to sign the treaty giving up their weapons. And with absolutely no deterrence against a terrorist group using the bomb, the likelihood that millions would die is even greater than if reasonably well behaved states possessed the weapons.\nThe fact that ICAN didn't achieve anything is apparently not a deterrent to its being awarded the peace prize. Then again, another recent recipient of the prize had been in office less than a year and was awarded the honor simply for proposing that nuclear weapons be eliminated. He had no other accomplishments to speak of. But Barack Obama ended up being the biggest embarrassment to the Nobel Committee in history when he went to war in four countries and killed thousands of civilians in drone strikes.\nOh, well."}

A year later, an LAPD coroner ruled that her death was caused by \"drowning and other undetermined factors.\"\nAccording to detectives, who also spoke to 48 Hours, an autopsy report revealed that there were bruises on Wood's body at the time of her death.\n\"She looked like a victim of an assault,\" Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Detective Ralph Hernandez said, adding that \"it is suspicious enough to make us think that something happened.\"\nInvestigators explained that Wagner, who was married to Wood from 1957 to 1962, and then again from 1972 until her 1981 death, has not been cooperating with the revived investigation.\n\"I haven't seen him [Wagner] tell the details that match all the other witnesses in this case,\" Corina said. \"I think he's constantly changed his story a little bit.

That was the spark Thomas needed to convince her friends to help put together a feminist and social justice oriented choir committed to peace, equality and respect for all people of Earth \u2014 the WomEnchant Chorus and Drummers.\n\u201cI had just starting learning about and hearing the music of a number of women who were social justice activist musicians \u2014 mostly singer\/songwriters \u2014 and I loved the music, the message, the point of view,\u201d recalls Thomas, artistic director of WomEnchant. \u201cSome of the songs were uplifting, some were funny and sarcastic, some were angry. Most of it had a determined, hopeful message and, for me, was quite inspiring.\u201d\nThe choir will be celebrating its 25th anniversary with a gala concert at Hernder Estate Wines in St. Catharines on Sunday, April 29. The performance starts at 2:30 p.m. and will feature music promoting peace, social justice and respect for Earth with guest soloists Beth Bartley, Betsy Tauro, Teresa Holierhoek and guest accompanist Lynne Honsberger.\nWomEnchant is not the first feminist choir to take on social justice issues with a peaceful approach; in fact it was two pre-existing choirs that inspired and supported Thomas in forming her own choir.\n\u201cI got a lot of great advice and support. One of those choirs was MUSE in Cincinnati. They are one of the oldest feminist choirs and their music director at the time, Catherine Roma, was very helpful. I went to Cincinnati and observed her rehearsals, talked to her and others in the choir and learned a lot,\u201d said Thomas.\nSince then the WomEnchant Chorus and Drummers have gone on to perform for numerous events and rallies such as International Women\u2019s Day celebrations, Take Back The Night rallies and V-Day anti-violence events. The group recently finished up its O Canada: An Anthem for all Canadians video project and hope to finish the CD they began working on years ago. But one thing will never change, says Thomas: \u201cWe will always continue to work on our main mission and do what we can to make the world a better place for everyone.\u201d\nTickets for the concert are $40 each or $20 for kids 12 and under and can be purchased at Rysons Music in St Catharines, Crock A Doodle in Grimsby or at the door.

Jake, 28, was a men\u2019s lacrosse team captain at Maryland and a Major League Lacrosse draft pick, and Jesse a two-time All-American with the Terps and a No. 4 overall selection. Now, Catherine Bernhardt\u2019s notion, even Jesse acknowledges, doesn\u2019t seem so far-fetched.\nAfter earning All-America honorable mention as a freshman midfielder at Maryland, Jared and the defending national champion Terps will face his brothers and the U.S. men\u2019s national team Saturday at Tierney Field in Sparks. It\u2019s the first time the trio will be on the same field in a competitive game. It\u2019s the first time Jesse, a defenseman and Maryland\u2019s new defensive coordinator, has to worry a little about getting bested by his baby brother.\n\u201cIn high school, I could still bull him around a little bit, but now that he's physically matured and he's kind of come into his own, I've got to get ready,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to be ready for him when we're playing.\u201d\nThe problem for the longest time, Jared said, was that he was just \u201cso young.\u201d He didn\u2019t see why he couldn\u2019t beat his brothers in whatever they were playing \u2014 and also why they might not want him to be wherever they were. (Mom and Dad had a hand in promoting fraternal cooperation, Jesse said.)\nBut being the son of a longtime coach, Jim Bernhardt, and the brother of two-sport high school stars, Jared naturally had what Terps coach John Tillman called \u201ca very good athletic IQ.\u201d In those friendly neighborhood games of street football, he was good enough to get picked to a team. Their ad hoc fields were as wide as the streets they played on, tight quarters that rewarded Jared\u2019s elusiveness and savvy.\nWhen he couldn\u2019t play, he watched. Years before Jared became one of the nation\u2019s top recruits, he came to Maryland lacrosse camps to learn from Tillman and to team practices to watch his brothers play.\n\u201cIf he wasn't competing with them, he was dragged around watching them, and he picked up a lot from them,\u201d Tillman said. \u201cThe way they competed, he watched what they did and I think he saw how hard they worked and how successful they were, and I think you have two great role models to kind of show him the way.\u201d\nSaid Jared: \u201cDefinitely, definitely wanted to follow in their footsteps.\u201d\nIt will be a real family reunion Saturday. Catherine and Jim Bernhardt are flying in to watch the game, part of this weekend\u2019s Team USA Fall Classic, and Jesse mused that this might be the first and last time the Bernhardts are ever on the same field together for a game that matters.\nWhich only raises the stakes, of course. Jared said he wouldn\u2019t let the possibility of taking on Jake, a midfielder, or Jesse \u201cget in the way\u201d of the Terps\u2019 game plan. Tillman said he expects Jared to be confident and aggressive against another Bernhardt, \u201cjust like anybody else that he's playing against.\u201d\nBut if he does score?\nJake: \u201cI probably won't say too much at the moment. Maybe something after, but I probably won't end up saying anything. Just let it be silent.\u201d\nJared: \u201cI'm sure at some point, I'll hear it. It might not be too vocal or too loud for anybody else to hear it, or he may save it when we're more in a family setting.\u201d\nTillman: \u201cAll they would have to do is just look at each other, and they would know. When you have brothers, you don't really need to say anything. You just give them that look.\u201d\nAnd Tillmn would know. \u201cI have two older brothers myself.\u201d\nTeam USA Fall Classic\nWhat: Maryland vs. Team USA (6 p.m. Saturday), 9\/11 Memorial Game (11:15 a.m. Sunday), Towson vs. Team USA (2 p.m. Sunday), Towson vs. Israel (4 p.m. Sunday)\nSite: Tierney Field, Sparks\nTickets: $10 each day, shop.uslacrosse.org\nVideo: US Lacrosse Facebook page, US Lacrosse YouTube channel, uslacrosse.org\nWhat\u2019s at stake: The weekend\u2019s games are the next step in the 49-player U.S. training team\u2019s preparation for the 2018 Federation of International Lacrosse Men\u2019s World Championship. Ultimately, 23 players and coach John Danowski will represent the country in Israel next summer.\nThe American roster features some of the biggest names in Major League Lacrosse, including Paul Rabil (Johns Hopkins), Joe Fletcher (Loyola Maryland), Rob Panell and Tom Schreiber, as well as college stars like Denver\u2019s Trevor Baptiste and Yale\u2019s Ben Reeves.\nMaryland\u2019s Connor Kelly, also on the U.S. training team, will play for the defending NCAA champion Terps on Saturday and against 2017 semifinalist Towson on Sunday.\njshaffer@baltsun.com\ntwitter.com\/jonas_shaffer"}
{"id":"af009f41-94eb-41bd-b3e6-d44516daa798","text":"Manhattan is packed with thousands of cabs it doesn't need, a new study suggests.\nThe MIT study, which was published Monday, revealed only 3,000 four-person sedans are needed to serve 98% of ride demands in Manhattan. That's in contrast to the 13,600 taxis and 45,000 for-hire drivers, including Uber and Lyft drivers, that serve greater New York City.\nBut there's a catch \u2014 for this to work, everyone would have to share rides and accept longer trips.\nThe MIT researchers created a computer formula for pooling passengers headed to similar destinations. Although ridesharing might add wait times and bring some riders out of their way to drop off passengers, the city would benefit from less congestion and pollution.\nThe study found passengers would have to wait an average of 2.8 minutes and trips would be delayed by an average of 3.5 minutes.\nIf Manhattan wanted to go even farther to limit traffic, it could adopt 10-passenger vans to serve as taxis -- an effort that could be done with just 2,000 vehicles.\nThe researchers analyzed a week of Manhattan taxi data from March 2013, including three million rides, to draw their conclusions.\nThe study is a striking example of the potential around ridesharing. Companies such as Uber and Lyft continue to push the concept, helped along by lowering fares, to customers.\nBut shared rides haven't been popular with many drivers. Uber drivers have complained UberPool means more work but not necessarily more pay. Some refuse to accept pooled rides. Many riders also avoid shared trips, preferring the comfort and efficiency of not riding with a stranger.\nRelated: How Uber punishes drivers who refuse to use UberPool\nSwitching to only shared rides could also impact the livelihood of thousands of drivers. Of the 13,600 New York taxis, roughly 10,000 are in use during peak hours. With only 3,000 shared taxis, most drivers would be left without work. The 45,000 for-hire drivers in the city would also be adversely impacted.\nEven if cities and consumers don't gravitate to shared rides today, driving jobs could eventually be eliminated as companies develop self-driving vehicles."}

{"id":"b122a687-1fe9-4e41-8121-dab871bd9794","text":"For a happy and lasting marriage, you need to first make sure you\u2019re not heading to the altar with red flags. By not having an honest, internal conversation with yourself and not addressing uncomfortable topics you\u2019d want to know about your future spouse, you\u2019re only setting yourself up for failure down the road. To avoid any surprises and major bumps in your marriage, make it a priority to discuss both of your expectations and hopes as a couple and get on the same page. Marriage might not be the best plan for you two if you can\u2019t agree on these nine things.\n1. Whether or not you want kids.\nDisagreeing on this subject isn\u2019t necessarily make or break, but if having children is extremely important to one partner and not the other, it could become a larger issue. Especially with biological clocks ticking, this conversation unfortunately has a shelf life and should be discussed early on. If kids are in no way in your future plans, communicate that very clearly.\n2. Your future goals together.\nDo you want to retire early and travel the world with one another, or is your dream to become the ultimate power couple and focus on your careers for as long as possible? Have a chat about what your expectations are for each other (like being parents). Remember, it\u2019s all negotiable, too. Maybe you can start your bucket list early together and hold off on kids until when you\u2019re both ready.\n3. Family matters.\nIn an ideal world, everybody would have in-laws they can love and tolerate, but that\u2019s just not the case unfortunately. Any hostility between you (or your SO) and an opposite friend or family member should be squashed before taking the next step. Your relationship will inevitably be affected by these dynamics when they feel like they have to choose between you and blood. If you all can\u2019t get along now, it\u2019s not going to become any easier later.\n4. Finances.\nSeparate or joint accounts, accumulated debt, a pre-nup, etc. are all important things you should discuss with your significant other. Money can put a huge strain on relationships, and it\u2019s often the reason why couples have problems down the line.\n5. Division of labor.\nBoth of your opinions on shared household responsibilities will most likely reveal themselves early on in the relationship. But just to be clear, make sure their expectations don\u2019t change when your relationship title does. Some people still have very traditional views on what a husband or wife, for example, should be taking care of. Figure out how you two want to split those chores and errands, and be honest about what you\u2019re willing or not willing to take on.\n6. Making personal decisions.\nWhat\u2019s considered off limits and what should always be a joint discussion? Do you want total control or do you not mind when your partner shares their very strong opinions? Keep in mind that marriage usually comes with having to make important decisions as a unit, so communicate clearly what you do or don\u2019t mind them having a say in.\n7. Religious expectations.\nIf you both come from different religious backgrounds, ask if he or she expects you to convert after marrying. Be vocal about how you feel about holidays and religious obligations, such as not wanting to attend church weekly. And if you two plan to have children, have a conversation about what faith you\u2019d like to raise them in.\n8. Monogamy.\nThis one may be obvious since marriage typically implies monogamy, but some people might be willing to explore the idea of an open relationship. Make it clear that you\u2019d like to discuss the possibility or shut it down completely early on. Or if you or your partner can\u2019t imagine committing to one person for the rest of your lives, it\u2019s an obvious sign that marriage shouldn\u2019t even be in the talks.\n9. The little things.\nA good indication that someone is truly right for you is if they make your relationship seem effortless. You can expect to have a quarrel here and there, but if you bicker about almost everything, it might not work out years later. Not being able to agree on even the most trivial matters is not sustainable for a lasting marriage. You will both eventually tire of arguing and either reach your limits or grow apart silently. The best question to ask yourself: Does our love feel easy?\nIf it seems like you and your partner passed the test, congratulations! You\u2019ve both got yourselves a keeper.\nSource: popsugar.com"}

Because of this, Rheinmetall believes the jobs will be long-term.\nFairfax MP Ted O'Brien, who is spearheading Team Queensland's push, said Rheinmetall's plan was \"far more than jobs, it's about lifelong careers\".\n\"We're not talking about Rheinmetall building low cost economies-of-scale production lines,\nbut a niche high-value centre of excellence.\n\"If you do the maths, you see that average revenue per employee is the range of some big\ntech companies like Amazon and LinkedIn, and so we're clearly talking high-value jobs,\" he said."}

While Fleming finished with three feature wins, a seventh-place finish (Charleson was third) on May 7 allowed Charleson to pull away in points, then a fifth-place finish on Aug. 27 (to Charleson\u2019s runner-up finish) dropped Fleming further behind the eventual champion.\nIn the E-Modified series points race, Kettering\u2019s Jamie Sites may have racked up more feature wins (4) than Beavercreek\u2019s Jack Jones (who had three), but Jones placed among the top-4 finishers in all but one race this season. Sites, on the other hand, finished sixth or worse in the four feature races that he didn\u2019t win.\nAs a result, Jones won the points chase by a solid margin, 375.5 to 279.5.\nThe Street Stock and Compact divisions ended their seasons on Aug. 27.\nStreet Stocks came down to a battle between Columbus drivers Phil Gussler Jr. and Jacob Muncy, with Gussler Jr. earning points with more on-track consistency to claim a 350 to 290 points margin for the win.\nGussler Jr. ran in all seven Street Stock features, placing fourth or better in each race with three wins.\nMuncy claimed three feature wins as well, and never finished lower than second in any race in which he competed. But he lost valuable points when he did not compete in the opening and closing events of the season.\nThe Compact division battle came down to consistency as well.\nColumbus\u2019s Dusty Harding had a sixth-place finish on Aug. 13 as his only Compact feature finish outside the top five. Meanwhile, fellow Columbusite Corey Kyer lost valuable points with an 11th-place finish in the series\u2019 second event on April 23 (while Harding placed fifth). Harding finished with 315 popints to Kyer\u2019s 279.\nThe points system was devised by Greene County News sports editor John Bombatch. A total of 50 points went to each feature race winner, with second receiving 45 points, and each subsequent finisher receiving five points less, down to 5 points for a 10th-place finish.

Messi and Suarez were lively and combined for the penalty \u2013 the Uruguayan winning it, when he tumbled easily under a challenge from Real keeper Keylor Navas, with the Argentine converting.\nBut elsewhere it is a mix of lesser talent and young potential not yet ready to play such a major role for a side with lofty ambition at home and abroad."}
{"id":"fd7c1fb7-05c9-4585-a340-f4d52967ce15","text":"International relations minister Lindiwe Sisulu has hinted that South Africa might yet flip-flop on a decision by the governing party that the country should withdraw from the International Criminal Court.\nSpeaking at a briefing at the Department of International Relations on Wednesday, Sisulu said the decision to leave the ICC was taken \"under the previous administration\", led by former president Jacob Zuma. She said the matter \"is still continuously serving before Cabinet. A final decision has not yet been taken\".\nREAD: Leaving the ICC would have had 'catastrophic international consequences' - Zak Yacoob\nOf late there have been \"other views\" that South Africa could do more to change the skewed bias against Africa in the ICC if it remained a party to the Rome Statute than if it withdrew.\n\"Perhaps we might be married to staying in there if only to make sure that our voices are heard in the ICC,\" she said.\n\"It is at that point that we are right now, so we are reopening the debate, we are still discussing, and when the debate is closed, it will be taken to Parliament. Either then by that, we will see if we are going forward or going back.\"\nWithout referring to the ANC and the administration of former president Jacob Zuma by name, she said \"at the point when the decision [to withdraw from the ICC] was taken, it was a unanimous decision on that matter\".\n'We might change our decision'\nHowever, now there were other voices \"that say now that the anger has gone down, why don't we revisit the situation, and I think we are open to revisiting the situation.\n\"We might come up with the same decision, or we might change our decision. I'm not in a position to determine how it will come out.\n\"The decision to withdraw was also confirmed by an ANC resolution during its national conference in Nasrec in December, and it is unclear how this will be dealt with now.\nSisulu, however, admitted that Justice Minister Michael Masutha \"is determined that this matter (i.e. withdrawal) should go on\".\nThe issue has, for the past few months been subject to a parliamentary process which also involved public consultations.\nMasutha appeared before the Portfolio Committee of Justice and Correctional Services in Parliament last month, where he made a presentation on the International Crimes Bill, tabled in December and making provision for South Africa to repeal the Implementation of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court Act, 2002, which would enable South Africa to withdraw from the ICC.\n'A culture of human rights'\nThe South African government previously attempted to withdraw from the ICC by informing the United Nations of its intention to do so but was forced to abandon the process after a court ruled that such a decision had to go through Parliament.\nSouth Africa's fallout with the ICC started after a visit by Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir to the country in 2015 to attend the African Union summit.\nAl-Bashir is considered an international fugitive of justice and signatories to the Rome Statute, which includes South Africa, are obliged to arrest him in their countries, but this would have been politically embarrassing for South Africa.\nREAD: South Africa should have arrested Al-Bashir - ICC\nAfrican Union member states in January last year resolved to withdraw from the ICC as a bloc, but even Kenya, who led this campaign after its president Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy, William Ruto, were charged by the court, subsequently turned lukewarm on this.\nSisulu said when South Africa joined the ICC (in 2002), it \"was to make sure that we can change the world, that we create a culture of human rights and accountability on an equal basis\".\nShe said the ICC ended up going after the \"small fry\" in Africa and ignoring the \"big fry\", whom she declined to name."}

By age 17, about half of Canadian youth are having sex, the CPS says.\n\"We're not recommending that this be used the minute the kid has their first period, but there are certain benefits in using the hormonal IUS \u2014 one of them being that it can reduce the amount of bleeding or also reduce cramping a lot,\" she said.\n\"We have even used it for that reason instead of for contraception in kids who have not even had sex.\"\nAndrew Townsend of Planned Parenthood Toronto welcomed the CPS recommendation, saying the clinic gets a lot of questions from young people who \"still view the pill as the first kind of birth control that they should start on or that they have to start on.\n\"Something like IUDs being a recommended option is great because different people have different needs,\" he said, adding that a growing number of clients being seen in the clinic are opting for the implanted devices. The program provides information and health-care services to those aged 13 to 29.\nWhile intrauterine contraception may be the most effective means of preventing unplanned pregnancy, the up-front costs of the devices are high compared with the pill and other methods, said Di Meglio.\nOne hormone-releasing IUS that lasts five year costs the Quebec government's prescription plan about $325, while copper-based IUDs run from about $60 to $100, she said. For those not covered under private insurance, the provincial plan covers 65 per cent of the cost of birth control pills and IUDs.\nCoverage by public insurance plans varies across the country. In Ontario, for instance, long-acting reversible contraceptives are fully covered for women under age 25, along with the physician's fee for implanting one of the devices.\nDi Meglio said that over time, IUDs and IUSs are actually more cost-effective than most other birth-control methods because of how long they last before needing to be replaced.\nThe CPS statement also recommends that practitioners adopt a collaborative approach that empowers youth to make informed decisions about their birth control options, weighing the benefits, risks, side-effects and suitability of each method based on individual preference.\n\"At the end of the day, we just want to facilitate whatever contraceptive they choose,\" Di Meglio said.\n\u2014 Follow @SherylUbelacker on Twitter.\nBy Sheryl Ubelacker, The Canadian Press"}
{"id":"8406b341-1b22-48d2-ae8f-df3cca8485a4","text":"The only constant in life is change, and that saying applies to our fashion choices. It is a good thing to try your best to pick good fashion sense, that way you can constantly improve the way you look and impress people with the way you look. Read on to learn how to approach it.\nThe best fashion tip you can get is to be yourself when it comes to what to wear. People have different opinions about what is fashionable, and you may aspire to be something you're not. The truth is, no matter what your style, you are always in fashion when you remain true to yourself.\nIf you tend to be a bit on the heavy side, do not try to hide your shape by dressing in baggy clothing. The added volume only accentuates your size and makes you look frumpy. Look for clothing that is more fitted around your waistline, but then flows away from your lower body to create more shape.\nHow to apply your makeup depends on where you are going. For example, if you are going for an interview, keep your makeup looking natural and highlight your best feature. For instance, if you have beautiful eyes, wear a soft color that enhances the color of your eyes. If your best feature is your cheekbones, add a little color to the apple of your cheeks.\nEven though something is all the rage in fashion at the moment, do not wear it if it does not compliment your body type and\/or personal style. For example, people that are on the heavier side should not wear skinny jeans. They are not very flattering so you will not look trendy if you wear them.\nDon't fall for a fashion trend if it doesn't fit your frame well. Everyone may be wearing the newest fashion fad, and you'll be tempted to follow suit. But if the newest style is not complementary to your physical frame, you will only be doing yourself a fashion disservice.\nIf you find a classic skirt, linen shirt or pair of jeans that fits you perfectly and makes you look and feel fabulous, buy two of them. Designers make their money by making changes every year so that customers will buy new items each season. You may not ever be able to replace that beloved item that gives you so much pleasure and confidence.\nTo add a touch a bit of \"spring\" to your wardrobe, go with mint green this season. This soft green looks great on its own or when paired with other colors like neutrals and other subdued hues. You can find it in various shades and in everything from dresses to shoes.\nReduce the clutter in your closet for extra storage room. You may think that multiple options are better; however, this is seldom the case. If your clothes are cramped inside your closet space, you might never find the outfit you're looking for. Go through your wardrobe and get rid of anything that doesn't fit you well or you haven't worn recently. You want to keep anything that you might consider wearing at some point though.\nWhen you are looking for a new piece of clothing, think carefully about what you already have. Buying something that doesn't match what you have in your closet is how some people end up with a closet full of things they never wear. Make sure any new piece fits in with your overall wardrobe.\nDon't fall for a fashion trend if it doesn't fit your frame well. Everyone may be wearing the newest fashion fad, and you'll be tempted to follow suit. But if the newest style is not complementary to your physical frame, you will only be doing yourself a fashion disservice.\nOne fashion tip that you will not want to ignore is the fact that your outerwear should be something, you love. In contrast to something that you simply need to wear. This is important because you wear it so often, and so many people are going to see you in it - you might as well make it count.\nDress for your body type. People come in all different shapes and sizes. It is important that you determine what style of clothing looks best on you. The average person doesn't have the body of the average fashion model. Don't go by what looks good in magazines, buy what looks flattering the mirror.\nA great fashion tip when it comes to blue jeans is to go for the smaller-sized pair if you are in doubt. As long as they are still comfortable, this is a good pick because jeans tend to stretch, and you do not want to have folds or a baggy appearance in unintended areas.\nStay away from fitted clothes if you are carrying a bit of extra weight around the middle. This type of clothes will make your extra weight more noticeable. Instead, wear loose fitting clothing that gives you a better line on your body.\nFollow these tips to freshen your look. When you do that, you can feel confident meeting anyone and leaving a fantastic first impression. Apply the tips in this article to your life and not only can you make a good first impression, you can make an unforgettable impression every day."}

Lavrov was speaking in the Indian capital after a three-way meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj at which, he said, India's reservations over the Chinese project were discussed. \"I know India has problems, we discussed it today, with the concept of One Belt and One Road, but the specific problem in this regard should not make everything else conditional to resolving political issues,\" he said. Russia, all the countries in central Asia, and European nations had signed up to the Chinese project to boost economic cooperation, he said. \"Those are the facts,\" he said. \"India, I am 100 percent convinced, has enough very smart diplomats and politicians to find a way which would allow you to benefit from this process.\" The comments by Russia, India's former Cold War ally, reflected the differences within the trilateral grouping formed 15 years ago to challenge U.S.-led dominance of global affairs. But substantial differences between India and China, mainly over long-standing border disputes, have snuffed out prospects of any real cooperation among the three. India, in addition, has drawn closer to the United States in recent years, buying weapons worth billions of dollars to replace its largely Soviet-origin military. Swaraj said the three countries had very productive talks on economic issues and the fight against terrorism. (Editing by Clarence Fernandez)"}
{"id":"23712c32-b70d-4630-a641-811bb5962f55","text":"Four words sum up the Silicon Valley hype machine at the end of 2016: \u201csquirrels and sea monkeys.\u201d\nThat was the repeated response from Magic Leap founder Rony Abovitz when Reed Albergotti of The Information asked about the technology behind the startup\u2019s augmented-reality glasses.\nFor months, as Albergotti recently reported, Magic Leap has wooed investors and journalists by strapping them into a bulky helmet that augments their world with Star Wars-like spaceships and other digital creations. But this helmet is too big and too expensive for the mass market, so the company is working to squeeze its technology into a sleek pair of wire-rim glasses. The rub, according to ex-employees speaking with The Information, is that the company is having trouble actually making that happen. Abovitz wouldn\u2019t let Albergotti try the glasses on, and when asked how they work, all he would say was: \u201cSquirrels and sea monkeys.\u201d\nMagic Leap, which WIRED featured in our May cover story about the history of virtual reality, declined requests for an interview with Abovitz and told us that its technology is progressing just fine. \u201cMagic Leap has built many prototypes to test and develop key design and technical requirements for our first shipping product,\u201d the company said in a canned statement. But the tale unloaded by The Information isn\u2019t all that unusual. It\u2019s merely another example of tech hype exceeding tech reality.\nFrank X. Shaw, Microsoft\u2019s head of communications, responded to Albergotti\u2019s expos\u00e9 by crowing that Microsoft\u2019s AR headset, Hololens, is actually real. But when you consider that Microsoft pulled its own AR bait-and-switch after the Hololens appeared on the cover of WIRED, this was nearly as amusing as the squirrels and the sea monkeys. The reality is that after two years of hype, AR doesn\u2019t do what you think it can do.\nMagic Leap is in Florida. And Microsoft is in Washington. But these are Silicon Valley companies. You can tell because they\u2019ve mastered the Valley\u2019s quintessential skill: using hype, misdirection, and obfuscation to promise what they can\u2019t yet deliver.\nThis was the Valley\u2019s dominant theme in 2016, the year when virtual reality, chatbots, delivery drones, autonomous cars, and blockchains were going to change everything. None of them did. Especially the chatbots. Granted, technology needs time to effect real change. And some of these technologies, particularly self-driving vehicles, showed real progress over the last twelve months. But 2016 was the year the hype became too much to bear, and at least one company buckled under the weight of it all.\nThat company, of course, was Theranos, which promised to revolutionize medicine with Edison, a machine that could diagnose hundreds of ailments with a single drop of blood. In 2015, a Wall Street Journal investigation showed that the tech didn\u2019t work as advertised. In 2016, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services banned the company from operating a lab for two years, and Theranos laid off 40 percent of its employees. Almost as entertaining as \u201csquirrels and sea monkeys\u201d: the bit in this fall\u2019s Vanity Fair article where, after Journal reporter John Carreyrou uncovers the company\u2019s deceptions, Theranos employees gather for an all-hands meeting and start chatting \u201cFuck you, Carreyrou\u201d as if they\u2019re singing \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d in Casablanca.\nNow, hype is as much a part of the Silicon Valley ethos as hoodies, stock options, and dog-friendly offices. But in the past, the extreme hype was largely limited to apps or online services or other ephemeral things. When such things fail to materialize or perform as promised, companies lose face and investors lose some money. So be it. What\u2019s different now is that companies are applying the same kind of ridiculous hype to extremely complex, extremely unfinished hardware, including medical hardware. It\u2019s one thing if an app doesn\u2019t work as advertised. It\u2019s quite another if a medical device or autonomous car doesn\u2019t.\nHere at the end of 2016, we\u2019ll cut delivery drones and autonomous cars some slack. These technologies are enormously complicated, and no one honestly expected them to work as promised anytime soon. That said, if Jeff Bezos pulls another Christmastime delivery drone marketing stunt, someone ought to whack him upside the head with a Google Wing. Right now, that\u2019s all a Google Wing is good for.\nThis was the year that at least one company collapsed under the weight of its own hype.\nEven things that worked were overhyped. The blockchain is proven technology\u2014we like proven technology!\u2014but most of the people hyping it had no idea what they wanted to do with it. And those who did left the back door open\u2014literally. The DAO, the self-seriously named Decentralized Autonomous Organization, was supposed change the future of venture capital but ended up getting hacked to the tune of $50 million.\nWhich brings us to chatbots, the biggest trend that didn\u2019t deliver in 2016. These wonders of modern technology were going to seamlessly dovetail with apps like Facebook Messenger and Skype, booking our plane flights, making our plane reservations, even talking to us. It would be like China, everyone said, where chatbots are all the rage on messaging apps like WeChat and Microsoft\u2019s Xiaoice chatbot is now chatting with 20 million people. But here at the end of 2016, it\u2019s clear that legitimate chatbots aren\u2019t what drives interactions on WeChat and that Xiaoice is flawed technology. When Microsoft unleashed a version of this chatbot here in the US, it listened to what the people said and immediately turned into a Nazi-loving racist.\nThough today\u2019s AI technology can\u2019t actually deliver a bot that carries on a conversation, we will say that AI gave the world lots of other stuff in 2016, like better machine translation and AlphaGo, the Google creation that topped a grandmaster at the ancient game of Go. But the real stuff was nearly eclipsed by all the AI that isn\u2019t, all the stuff that\u2019s merely hype. Google\u2019s DeepMind lab saved its parent company tens of millions of dollars using AI to control the fans, windows, and chillers in its data centers. But that figure almost seems small compared to the number of emails I received trumpeting artificial intelligence that runs on squirrels and sea monkeys.\nThis is all good for a laugh, but it\u2019s also serious stuff. Companies and their investors are pouring untold millions into over-hyped technologies that promise to radically remake healthcare, transportation, even money itself. In the short term, investors, and occasionally consumers, get burned when these things fail to materialize. In the long-run, this can undermine markets, even bring them down. It may even destroy our ability to discern the real from the fake. And if 2016 showed us anything, it showed us just how dangerous that can be."}

It's a rare event many people want to take in, but if you don't protect yourself, you could put your eyes at risk for some long-term damage.\nIt's simple. Don't look up with your eyes uncovered. And no, sunglasses won't help you either, in fact they could be worse.\n\"It could be permanent damage on your retina. It could potentially scar and burn your retina just like a sunburn on your skin. If it's bad enough, it could be permanent and cause permanent vision loss, so people need to take it pretty seriously,\" said optometrist Nick Feipel of Busby Eyecare Optometrist.\nSometimes you won't notice the damage until a few hours later. Blurred vision, a spot in your vision, or straight lines that appear wavy. Worst case scenario would be permanent vision loss.\n\"Sometimes oral steroids can be used. There's not, to be quite honest, there's not a lot of treatment for this permanent damage,\" Feipel said.\nSo yes, all of that sounds pretty scary so let's avoid that by getting certified solar eclipse glasses. Not knockoffs like the glasses sold by some vendors on Amazon, which have now been removed. Make sure your glasses meet the worldwide standard known as ISO 12312-2.\n\"When you get the glasses, make sure that when you're looking through them that everything is completely black. You're not going to be able to see anything through the glasses. The only thing you're going to be able to see is when you put them on the sun it's going to look like a little orange or yellowish ball,\" Feipel said.\nSo doctors say don't be brave or careless and not listen to these warnings, you only get one set of eyes that are depending on you to take in the solar eclipse wisely.\n\"$3 to make sure you can view a great celestial event and ensure you don't have any permanent damage, I think is a pretty good investment.\" Feipel said.\nFor a full list of reputable companies selling solar eclipse glasses click here.\nAlso, there\u2019s a do it yourself method you can also use to view the eclipse safely, it\u2019s what people used back in the day called a pinhole viewer you make with products you have at home.

The letter also said that DISA was aware of the company\u2019s use of Russian programmers when the contract was negotiated in 2007.\nIn a statement, Netcracker said the agreement validated that the company had committed no wrongdoing and performed all obligations under its contract and that it was voluntarily investing millions to create a new cyber security framework.\n\u201cWe are proud to work with the U.S. government to enhance Netcracker\u2019s capabilities and technology, and we hope these security protocols will serve as a model for the kind of security expected in the industry,\u201d Chief Executive Andrew Feinberg said.\nNetCracker agreed in 2015 to pay $11.4 million to resolve civil allegations that it allowed Russian nationals without security clearances to work on the defense contract following a whistleblower complaint."}

You\u2019ve got to make the assumption he had to have some help at some point,\u201d he said.\nAs the investigation grinds on, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department officers led the funeral of LVMPD officer Charleston Hartfield Thursday, who was among those gunned down at the Route 91 Harvest Festival country music event.\nHis body was escorted to Palm Downtown Mortuary and Cemetery, and a memorial was held for the slain police officer at Police Memorial Park in the northwest of the city \u2014 one of several vigils in Las Vegas on Thursday evening.\nGun debate continues\nIn the wake of the deadly attack, the Eastside Cannary Casino Gun Show that was expected to be held in Las Vegas this weekend has been canceled, David Strow of Boyd Gaming Corporation tells CNN.\n\u201cThis was a mutual decision with the show\u2019s organizers, given recent events, it was the prudent thing to do,\u201d Strow said.\nFive days after the mass shooting, authorities still are trying to determine the motivation of the retired accountant, who had no criminal record and did not raise any flags while purchasing an arsenal of weapons.\nTwelve of the 23 firearms found in the hotel suite had bump stocks \u2014 legal accessories for semi-automatic rifles that allow a shooter to fire rounds more rapidly.\nIn the aftermath of Sunday\u2019s shooting, pro-gun Republican lawmakers and the National Rifle Association, the powerful pro-gun lobby, have suggested supporting a review of bump stocks.\nPoliticians from both sides of the aisle and lobbyists are now saying the controversial devices, which sell for under $200, should be subject to additional regulation.\nUS President Donald Trump is open to considering legislation that would ban bump stocks but wants to hear more information on the matter before making a final determination, the White House said Wednesday.\n\u2018Numbers\u2019 found on note\nLombardo said a note with numbers written on it was found in Paddock\u2019s room, according to the New York Times. Authorities are trying to analyze its meaning, but Lombardo didn\u2019t elaborate on whether they are significant or not.\n\u201cLombardo said that it contained numbers that were being analyzed for their relevance, and that it was not a manifesto or suicide note,\u201d the Times reported.\nPaddock had rented rooms at other festivals\nBefore checking into the Mandalay Bay days before the massacre, Paddock rented a room at a Las Vegas condo complex that overlooked the September 22-24 Life is Beautiful music festival.\nIn addition, in August, a person named Stephen Paddock reserved a room at Chicago\u2019s Blackstone Hotel during the city\u2019s Lollapalooza music festival, said Wagstaff Worldwide, which represents the hotel.\nBut that person never checked into the hotel, which overlooked the festival, Wagstaff Worldwide spokeswoman Emmy Carragher said.\nIt was not immediately clear whether the Stephen Paddock who booked the room was the same Stephen Paddock behind the Las Vegas massacre.\nThe Chicago Tribune, citing an anonymous law enforcement source, reported that it was the shooter Stephen Paddock who booked the room at the Blackstone Hotel.\nHairdresser: Paddock spoke about girlfriend\u2019s trip\nKallie Beig, who worked at the Great Clips in Mesquite, Paddock\u2019s hometown, told CNN exclusively that she had cut Paddock\u2019s hair at least three times over the past three years, and that every time he had come in, always early in the morning, he had smelled of strong liquor.\nHe would tell her that he\u2019d been up all night gambling, she said.\nThe last time she saw him was two months before Sunday\u2019s tragedy, she said.\nDuring his last visit, he told her he was planning on sending his girlfriend, Marilou Danley, to the Philippines and he was going to be alone. She did not discuss the trip with Danley personally.\n\u201cThe last time I saw him was probably only about two months ago\u2026 he came in and got his hair cut, and again, smelled of alcohol, and his girlfriend was with him\u2026 doing her own thing, and he was telling me about her leaving to go to the Philippines.\u201d\nShe said that the interaction was normal and didn\u2019t raise any red flags with her.\n\u201cHe was going to be home alone hanging out for a while by himself but it wasn\u2019t anything weird, it wasn\u2019t anything that seemed off.\u201d\nIn her statement released through her attorney, Matt Lombard, Danley said the trip was a surprise.\n\u201cA little more than two weeks ago, Stephen told me he found a cheap ticket for me to the Philippines and that he wanted me to take a trip home to see my family,\u201d she said.\n\u201cLike all Filipinos abroad, I was excited to go home and see family and friends.\u201d\nBeig characterized their relationship as quite cold and distant \u2014 she said she didn\u2019t see them interacting in any sort of intimate way."}

Indian IT giants outsource tens of thousands of tech specialists to the United States each year, and limiting the visa program that brings them in could disrupt their multibillion-dollar industry.\nCongress and the White House have targeted what is arguably the most coveted of U.S. visas: the H1-B. It's \"a kind of temporary work visa that allows professionals from other countries to work in the United States for a designated U.S. employer,\" explains Stephen Yale-Loehr, a Cornell University immigration law professor.\nYale-Loehr says that with the economy picking up, the program is in particularly big demand. Last year, U.S. companies that sought to bring highly skilled workers to the U.S. filed 236,000 petitions that went into a lottery for just 85,000 H1-B visas, the legal cap. The bulk of the winners: Indian computer specialists, many of them graduates of U.S. universities.\nYale-Loehr says that places like Europe and Australia have special visas to attract such talent, but that the United States doesn't.\n\"We have to shoehorn high-tech workers into categories like the H1-B, and it's getting more difficult every year,\" he says.\nFor many H1-B holders, the temporary work visa \u2014 issued for a maximum of six years-- has been a stepping stone to obtaining a green card. That grants permanent residence in the U.S., and in turn provides a path to citizenship.\nBut newly introduced legislation in Congress and drafts of executive orders reportedly circulating in the Trump White House would tighten the H1-B program.\nIndian software services firms last year earned 60 percent of their $108 billion in export revenues from the U.S. Their executives will travel to Washington this month to lobby against measures that take aim at one of India's most successful industries.\nOne bill proposes more than doubling the minimum wage of H1-B holders, which by law is set at $60,000. Critics argue the H1-B has been misused to displace American workers, and that there has been an incentive to prefer Indian IT workers because they are cheaper.\nShailesh Chitnis, with the data mining and analysis company Compile, says that while the median salary for all H1-B holders is $71,000, most but not all Indian outsourcers pay below that. If they had to double salaries, Chitnis says, Indian IT companies would have to change their 20-year-old business model.\n\"Because these organizations are not going to be bringing in people at $120,000 to fill those jobs \u2014 it would simply be too expensive,\" he says. \"They'll have to look at some other alternatives.\"\nBut Shevendra Singh with India's National Association of Software Services Companies, or NASSCOM, refutes allegations that Indian companies are dislocating American workers or supplying low-paid labor. Singh says there is demand in the U.S. for Indian technical talent because of a severe shortage of qualified Americans with degrees in science, technology, engineering and math.\n\"The crux of the issue is the STEM skill shortage in the U.S.,\" Singh says.\nIn its 2012 report, the U.S. president's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology found that \"fewer than 40-percent of students who enter college intending to major in a STEM field complete a STEM degree.\" The council concluded that in the next decade, economic forecasts point to a need to produce \"approximately 1 million more college graduates in STEM fields than expected under current assumptions.\"\nR. Chandrashekhar, president of NASSCOM, says that if the skills aren't available in the U.S. \u2014 and companies can't bring workers in \u2014 the jobs either won't get done or they will go out of the country and be done remotely.\n\"Talent has become more important than investment or trade,\" he says. \"And those who consciously cut themselves off from the global supply chains of talent are depriving themselves of a good thing.\"\nChandrashekhar notes that the intermingling of American and Indian ingenuity helped build Silicon Valley, and says protectionist impulses could weaken the United States, and what makes it unique.\n\"America is No. 1,\" Chandrashekhar says. \"What has really helped them to rise, absolutely, to the top, is that they have attracted talent from across the world. ... It would be really a pity if that was reversed without thinking it through.\"\nImmigration expert Yale-Loehr, co-author of a 21-volume treatise on immigration law, agrees that the United States faces a crisis in maintaining its innovative and competitive edge, and says it should be inviting more, not less, IT talent to its shores.\n\"In a globalized economy, the best and the brightest want to work in the best places \u2014 and if they're unable work in the United States, or it takes too long or is too difficult, they'll find a place in Canada or Europe or India where their talents can be appreciated,\" he says.\nIf implemented, Yale-Loehr says the draft executive order would initiate a review of the H1-B program but likely have no direct, immediate impact.\nHowever, he says \"it sends a strong signal that we no longer like foreign workers \u2014 we're all about only U.S. workers.\"\nThat, Yale-Loehr says, is eventually going to hurt the U.S.\nCopyright 2017 NPR.

The Senate could give final approval to the bill as early as Thursday.\nDemocrats and Republicans said the Russian sanctions, the result of extensive bipartisan negotiations, are needed to send a warning to Moscow and anyone else who interferes in U.S. elections will be punished.\n\u201cWe will not tolerate attacks on our democracy,\u201d said Sen. John McCain, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\nBut the sanctions set up a confrontation with President Trump, who has dismissed reports of Russia\u2019s interference in the election and whose administration has been attempting to improve U.S. relations with Moscow.\nNot only does the amendment impose new sanctions on what it identifies as \u201ccorrupt Russian actors,\u201d it makes it impossible for the Trump administration to remove them unilateraly.

Mr. Crosby himself has done many similar things. Search \"P.K. Subban surprises\" and you will see the top defenceman popping in constantly on young hockey players, hospital patients, poor kids and down-on-their-luck families. Connor McDavid, Johnny Gaudreau, Mark Scheifele and Carey Price yield similar results (although nobody hands out quite as many thrills as Mr. Subban.)\nBut the story of Mr. Crosby dropping in on Guillaume Ouimet is actually a tale of more prosaic and subtle beauty. Mr. Ouimet, after all, is no child (he's 19), is not underprivileged (he's going to McGill University to study business next year) and is so level-headed it is hard to imagine him being star struck. (He did have a poster of Mr. Crosby when he was younger, however.)\nStory continues below advertisement\nAnd Mr. Crosby's purpose that day was not to put a smile on anyone's face, although that was the happy result. Instead, this is the story of a master working on his craft while lesser NHL players (and they're all lesser players) were putting up their feet, and about a master sharing a few trade secrets with an eager apprentice.\nIt's also a story about three people with impeccable manners.\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins were on a five-day break on Jan. 9 when Mr. Ouimet rose before dawn and headed to the outdoor rink adjacent to the home arena of the Junior AA team he captains, the Diables de Mont-Tremblant. Mr. Ouimet relishes the morning outdoor solitude.\nMr. Ouimet was skating and shooting at an empty net when a Jeep pulled up, the driver immediately recognizable. Flushed, Mr. Ouimet rushed over to introduce himself to Mr. Crosby and his girlfriend. After a few minutes checking out the clean ice, the 30-year-old Penguins captain asked if more people were coming. Mr. Ouimet explained that he's always alone at that hour. Mr. Crosby went to the Jeep to get his tools: skates, a stick and gloves, along with elbow and shin pads to add game-like workout weight. With the change room closed, Mr. Crosby got ready in the snow and -15 C chill. His partner put on her skates, too.\nMr. Crosby told Mr. Ouimet he had trouble in recent games emerging from corners with the puck on his backhand side. Mr. Crosby set up his girlfriend's boots as pylons and gave Mr. Ouimet passing instructions. Mr. Crosby then led the duo in other drills, including some designed to help Mr. Ouimet as a defenceman.\n\"This is the best player in the world, he's on vacation with his girlfriend and he brings his equipment so he can work,\" Mr. Ouimet says. \"And he helps me, too. His quest for perfection is something to see.\"\nWith the work complete about an hour later, Mr. Ouimet gave Mr. Crosby a tour of his team's arena. Mr. Crosby met workers, switching to the French he picked up 15 years ago playing junior hockey in Rimouski, Que. \"You could tell it was important for him to speak French,\" Mr. Ouimet says. \"He spoke to everyone as equals. He asked me as many questions as I asked him.\"\nStory continues below advertisement\nStory continues below advertisement\nMr. Ouimet asked Mr. Crosby if the couple was there to ski or visit Mario Lemieux, the former star and Penguins owner who has a home in the Laurentians. Just a couples' getaway, Mr. Crosby replied, adding he isn't allowed to ski under his contract.\nAt one point the two-time Olympic gold-medal winner and three-time Stanley Cup winner sat quietly in the dressing room and stared into the distance. He was reminiscing about his own youth hockey days, he told Mr. Ouimet when asked if anything was wrong.\nFinally, Mr. Crosby's girlfriend reminded him they had someplace to be. Mr. Crosby's partner promised Mr. Ouimet some photos she had taken and they left. Two days later she delivered, unprompted.\nMr. Ouimet returned to hockey and studies. He told his family and a few friends about his encounter, some of whom believed him only when he produced photos. He sought no attention, but in the small world of elite youth hockey the story reached Mathias Brunet, a La Presse reporter deeply involved in the sport.\nWhen Mr. Brunet called to do a story, Mr. Ouimet said he would have to ask permission. The couple told him to go ahead, asking only that the name of Mr. Crosby's partner remain private. Mr. Ouimet said he is also keeping other details of their conversations to himself.\n\"He's such a private guy. They're both private,\" Mr. Ouimet says. \"I really want to avoid betraying their trust.\"\nStory continues below advertisement\nThe story finally came out on Jan. 31, three weeks after the encounter. Mr. Ouimet has been busy retelling it since. \"It really was a life lesson,\" Mr. Ouimet says. \"You can be the best at what you do, and still work to be better. And you can still be really humble and have your feet on the ground.\""}

It was the first monthly decline in jobs in seven years.\nThe jobless rate dropped to 4.2%, the lowest since 2001.\nEconomists had been expecting an increase of 90,000 jobs, even after accounting for the hurricanes. But the economists and Labor Department expect the decline to be short-lived as employers closed by the storm in Houston and Florida are able to reopen.\nThere could be an increase in jobs in coming months due to the storms as homes and other buildings are repaired or rebuilt, and Americans buy cars and other items to replace those that were lost.\nEven the drop in jobs reported in September could disappear in future revisions of the estimate as the Labor Department is able to collect information from businesses that it was unable to contact due to the storm.\nThe hurricanes already appear to have led to job creation in some parts of the economy.\nThe insurance industry added 10,900 jobs in September as claims adjusters were hired to assess the damage. And building supply stores was by far the strongest segment of retailing. Those stores added 5,300 jobs, even as retailing overall lost 2,900 in the month.\nRelated: Irma and Harvey together will be as expensive as Hurricane Katrina\nHurricane Harvey came ashore on the Texas Gulf Coast on Aug. 25, too late to show up in the August jobs reading. But many businesses were still closed by the flooding that accompanied the storm when the Labor Department started to survey employers in the middle of September.\nHurricane Irma hit the Florida Keys on Sunday, Sept. 10, then moved up the state in the following days, shutting down many employers, including both businesses, schools and government offices, during the week that employment is measured.\nRelated: 5 innovators: How we deal with stress\nThe biggest hit to jobs came from a drop of 105,000 at restaurants and bars. The Labor Department said that decline is very likely related to the storms. The sector had been adding about 24,000 jobs a month before the storm.\nThe 4.2% unemployment rate was down from 4.4% in August. The drop was a surprise to economists and was not related to the hurricane. Instead it came from a jump in the number of workers telling the Labor Department they had found work, and a drop in those who were without a job. The unemployment rate is now close to what economists consider to be full employment.\nHurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, did not affect this report.

The markets have been shaken up as a result with Jack Hobbs now 9\/4 from 3s with BetVictor for the Prince of Wales\u2019s Stakes and Order of St George 5\/6 from 5\/4 to retain his Gold Cup crown.\nToday\u2019s highlight at Newbury is the listed Ballymacoll Stud Stakes for three-year-old fillies over ten furlongs and it is hard to get away from the chances of Guineas fourth Talaayeb (3.05) whose pedigree suggests she will appreciate today\u2019s step up in distance.\nThe selection has only had the two career starts and is open to significant improvement and if she stays, she will win. Her dam finished runner up in the Park Hill (14f) so she could easily get further in time and does hold an entry in the Irish Oaks next month.\nIn the opener Being There (1.30) makes his debut for Godolphin in the six-and-a-half furlong maiden and it is well documented that trainer Charlie Appleby has a terrific record with his juveniles this term. The selection cost connections 1.4m Euros as a yearling and holds an entry in the Gp 1 Phoenix Stakes later in the year.\nRichard Hannon\u2019s juveniles invariable improve for the run and Rogue shaped up nicely on debut when fourth here on soft ground last month \u2013 the booking of Ryan Moore suggests connections expect a bold show.\nMutakatif (2.00) may have run into a decent sort of Tom Dascombe\u2019s when beaten at Haydock on debut and one of the newcomers will have to be well above average if they are to lower his colours this afternoon. Sir Michael Stoute\u2019s Expert Eye has the pedigree to be smart and it is interesting that Dascombe brings Shootingthe Breeze down from his Cheshire base this afternoon.\nHattons Hill has won his last five at his beloved Hexham and must go close to making it six on the spin at Uttoxeter this evening given the handicapper has only seen fit to raise him a couple of pounds for his latest success. I am going to take a chance however on Lovely Job (6.25) who is returning from a 400-day lay-off for Fergal O\u2019Brien.\nThe selection has been keen and will have to settle if he is to get home but he is a horse I thought had some potential over fences before his break and his yard can certainly get them fit at home. The betting will provide valuable clues as to stable expectations on his comeback and three of his six rivals won last time out \u2013 a cracking race but Lovely Job could still make up into a decent chaser.\nNo Such Number is chasing a four-timer having, like Hattons Hill, made hay at Hexham into recent weeks winning his last three. The nine-year-old is 12lbs higher than when scoring earlier in the month, and has obviously thrived since joining the yard of former Grand National winning jockey Maurice Barnes in Cumbria.\nThis might go to another National winning jockey, however, with Lettheriverrundry (7.30) getting the vote. The JP McManus-owned gelding looked as if he was getting the hand of fences when finishing second to a well-handicapped rival at Worcester last time, and he is taken to build on that sound effort for Brendan Powell.\nAt Haydock, Lugano looked well ahead of the handicapper when scoring on the all-weather last week over 12f. The four-year-old has to prove he can be as equally effective on turf and preference is for Zenafire (6.05) who scored over C&D last week and must go close as long as the ground doesn\u2019t dry out too much.\nFor all the latest odds head to BetVictor.com and follow @BetVictorRacing on Twitter."}

And now the company is now considering more shared ownership development.\nSaid Project Director, John Clephan: \u201cGenerally the number of shared ownership homes being offered in the city has diminished in recent years, following the introduction of the government backed Help to Buy initiative. This effectively provides a 20% loan towards the cost of the property.\n\u201cSo, with our affordable housing partner in this venture - Great Places \u2013 we decided to build 12 homes to offer another option to those looking to buy their own place and see whether there was demand. The results have been amazing.\n\u201cIncreasing the choice of housing in an area is an important factor in building and maintaining a strong residential community. The different types of housing tenure available to people certainly contributes to that. As a result, we will consider building more shared ownership properties.\u201d\nMatthew Harrison, Chief Executive of Great Places Housing Group, added: \u201cWe experienced fantastic levels of demand at Brearley Forge, with all of our shared ownership properties being reserved within 12 weeks of launching. In fact, half were snapped up from plan, demonstrating the need for modern affordable homes in Parson Cross.\n\u201cThe spacious layout of homes appealed to local families, giving them the chance to step onto the property ladder and purchase a brand new home. Customers reported that houses were contemporary, functional, had a good sized garden, plenty of storage and were priced affordably because of the Shared Ownership option.\u201d\nThe homes were marketed and sold through Plumlife, the sales specialists at Great Places Housing Group. They were available for \u00a338,500 for a 35 percent share of a two-bedroomed home, with a monthly rent of \u00a3164; \u00a342,000 for a 35 percent share of a three-bedroomed property with a monthly rent of \u00a3179 and \u00a347,250 for a 35 percent share of a four-bedroomed house, with a monthly rent of \u00a3201.\nGill Furniss MP for Sheffield, Brightside and Hillsborough, said when she visited the opening of the show home: \u201cFor far too many people the dream of owning their own home seems to be forever out of reach. That\u2019s why I congratulate Sheffield Housing Company on its bold plan to extend the project across the city. Every newly built home counts and shared ownership is a great way for first-time buyers to put their own roof over their heads.\u201d\nSHC is a joint venture between Sheffield City Council, Keepmoat and Great Places Housing Group, which has a 15-year plan to build 2,300 new homes \u2013 mainly for outright sale - in seven of the city\u2019s suburbs. A mixture of two to six bedroomed homes are being built with spacious rooms and contemporary designs.\nTo date around 325 homes have been completed \u2013 237 sold and 88 for affordable rent and shared ownership. The project has created 120 new jobs and 40 apprenticeships for local people, invested \u00a36.5 million with city region businesses and almost \u00a380,000 in community initiatives and educational support.\nA \u00a35.4 million loan from the Homes and Communities Agency is supporting the second phase of development which includes an extension to Cutler\u2019s View, on land between Park Grange Road and Beeches Drive. Here 83 homes and nine apartments will be constructed.\nThen, on land adjacent to Fir Vale School playing fields, 59 larger than average, two to six bedroomed homes will be built, while a further 122 family homes at Brearley Forge and 181 homes at Harborough Avenue, Manor and planned.\nIn a venture with Sigma Capital Group a three storey, 24 apartment development of rented homes is being constructed at the former Park Grange residential home \u2013 further broadening the types of tenure being offered by SHC."}

Launch complex 40 at the Florida Air Force station was heavily damaged in the Sept. 1 mishap, and the company plans to use a repurposed space shuttle launch pad at the nearby Kennedy Space Center for its next Falcon 9 flight from Florida.\nSources indicate the first flight from Kennedy will be another commercial mission. The next SpaceX flight to deliver cargo to the International Space Station, the company\u2019s 10th under contract to NASA, is expected to take place some time after the commercial mission.\nSpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 rocket uses super-cooled, or \u201cdensified,\u201d liquid oxygen and RP-1 kerosene fuel to provide additional performance during ascent. To achieve and maintain the desired low temperatures, propellant loading begins just 35 minutes before launch.\nTo push propellants to the rocket\u2019s engines, the Falcon 9 uses highly pressurized helium stored in aluminum bottles, wrapped in a tough, insulating carbon composite material. The bottles, known as composite overwrap pressure vessels, or COPVs, are mounted inside the propellant tanks, submerged in frigid liquid oxygen and chilled kerosene.\nOn Sept. 1, about five minutes before a planned test firing of the Falcon\u2019s nine Merlin 1D first stage engines \u2014 a routine pre-launch test for SpaceX \u2014 the second stage suddenly exploded in a spectacular conflagration that was caught on video and widely seen around the world.\nThe rocket and it\u2019s $195 million payload, a commercial communications satellite, were destroyed, causing heavy damage to launch complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Just 93 milliseconds elapsed from the first signs of trouble to the explosion.\n\u201cInvestigators scoured more than 3,000 channels of video and telemetry data covering a very brief timeline of events,\u201d SpaceX said in a statement posted to its website. \u201cBecause the failure occurred on the ground, investigators were also able to review umbilical data, ground-based video, and physical debris.\n\u201cTo validate investigation analysis and findings, SpaceX conducted a wide range of tests at its facilities in Hawthorne, California and McGregor, Texas.\u201d\nSpaceX is generally tight-lipped when it comes to technical details, and the statement posted Monday provided only a general overview of the team\u2019s findings. It said accident investigators \u201cconcluded that one of the three composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs) inside the second stage liquid oxygen (LOX) tank failed.\u201d\n\u201cSpecifically, the investigation team concluded the failure was likely due to the accumulation of oxygen between the COPV liner and overwrap in a void or a buckle in the liner,\u201d the company said.\nInvestigators believe those extremely low temperatures may have caused some of that trapped oxygen to solidify. In any case, when the tank was pressurized, trapped oxygen pushing against the carbon overwrap fibers likely generated friction \u201cleading to ignition and the subsequent failure of the COPV.\u201d\nLiquid oxygen has a temperature of around minus 298 degrees Fahrenheit, but SpaceX chills the propellant to around minus 340 degrees for use aboard the Falcon 9. The RP-1 kerosene fuel, which normally is stored at a room temperature 70 degrees, also is chilled. The lower temperatures increase the propellants\u2019 density.\nA rocket engine\u2019s thrust is directly proportional to the rate propellants are consumed and expelled. By \u201cdensifying\u201d the Falcon 9 propellants, more fuel can be stored and pumped through the engines, increasing performance.\nWhile earlier rockets, including the Titan 2 booster used to launch NASA\u2019s Gemini spacecraft in the 1960s, used propellant cooling to increase density, and thus engine performance, the upgraded Falcon 9 is believed to be the first utilizing super-cooled cryogenic oxygen.\nSpaceX founder Elon Musk said in 2015, when propellant cooling was first implemented in the Falcon 9, that \u201cwe\u2019re sub-cooling the propellant, particularly the liquid oxygen, close to its freezing point, which increases the density quite significantly.\u201d\nFailure investigators \u201cidentified several credible causes for the COPV failure, all of which involve accumulation of super chilled LOX or SOX (solidified oxygen) in buckles under the overwrap,\u201d the company said in its statement.\n\u201cThe corrective actions address all credible causes and focus on changes which avoid the conditions that led to these credible causes. In the short term, this entails changing the COPV configuration to allow warmer temperature helium to be loaded, as well as returning helium loading operations to a prior flight proven configuration based on operations used in over 700 successful COPV loads.\u201d\nThe company did not provide any details about those earlier helium loading procedures but said it plans to redesign the helium bottles in the long term \u201cto prevent buckles altogether, which will allow for faster loading operations.\u201d\nThe Sept. 1 failure was the second involving the Falcon 9\u2019s second-stage helium pressurization system.\nDuring a June 2015 launch to deliver supplies to the space station, a strut holding a second-stage helium tank in place inside the liquid oxygen tank failed, allowing the helium bottle to shoot up and crash into the top of the oxygen tank, triggering a catastrophic rupture.\nIt was SpaceX\u2019s first outright Falcon 9 failure in 19 launchings dating back to the rocket\u2019s maiden flight in June 2010. After taking steps to ensure all internal struts met design specifications, SpaceX launched nine successful missions in a row before the Sept. 1 launch pad disaster, all of them using densified propellants."}

All these joints have been around for at least half a century, making them certified OGs of Toronto\u2019s dining scene. Watch and learn, young grasshopper, these are the real purveyors of old-school cool.\nHere are the oldest diners in Toronto.\nJust a short walk from the Eaton Centre, this classy diner is a much-needed reprieve from the incessant 21st century screens at Dundas Square. Slide into one of their booths to transport yourself back to 1929 \u2013 when it all began \u2013 and gorge on their comfort food.\nAlso founded in 1929, this Leslieville institution does cheap hearty eats and a classic lean steak and potatoes that some people adore. They've had a few years of practice, so it makes sense.\nFor more than 80 years, this snack bar has seen Leslieville transform from a barren sea of warehouses to an area catering to film buffs and artists. Still, despite this and decades of inflation, the Chan family still insists on a menu price cap of $3 \u2013 bless their hearts.\nOpen 24-hours, this diner has been going strong since 1932. Renovations in 2008 plus incredibly cheap daily drink specials make this diner one of the most comfy and reliable spots to hang on Dundas West.\nThis spot on King East has been serving the city classic Irish breakfasts since 1941. A scene from the rom-com The F Word was filmed here, making use of the diner's plushy red booths and old school appeal.\nLocated steps from Yorkville near the corner lovingly dubbed Av and Dav, this place has been around since 1944. They've got tons of photos featuring celebrities enjoying their standard eggs and burgers dish, which you can still order to this day.\nOpened in 1948, this is one of the oldest restaurants on the Danforth. It looked like it would be lost when it closed in 2016, but it was saved by a long time patron Tim Dutaud and his restaurateur partner Kevin Wallace. The interior has been refreshed but it still retains all its retro charm.\nWith black-and-white checkered tiles, plushy red bar stools and turquoise walls, this place is the definition of retro. It's been in North York since 1950 and has since changed hands, though its menu still consists of diner classics like milkshakes and hot dogs.\nThis narrow little diner in Little Italy was established in 1951. Their all day breakfasts are greasy, just as they should be, and they still hold their own as one of the best morning-after spots in the area, despite relatively newer brunch spots like Aunties and Uncles.\nRun by the Papas family since its inception in 1953, this King East diner is a certified classic with deep booths, meat loaves on Fridays, and an iconic neon sign that dates all the way back to the diner's beginnings.\nThis place started as Ted's Variety and Coffee Shop in 1954 but now it's just regular ol' Ted. This Scarborough diner serves three-egg specials with pancakes and even has a shrine dedicated to bacon. That's what I call timeless.\nNo tables here, just bar stools and an open kitchen that lets you watch as the chef assembles your steak and eggs. Vesta's been in the Annex since 1955 and is a true greasy spoon.\nThe state of affairs at this diner had started to go downhill well after its opening in 1955, but thankfully 2016 saw a major overhaul that changed the game. This reliable diner in East York now has a shiny new retro feel.\nYou can't live in or around Scarborough and never have gone to this restaurant on Lawrence. It's served the area since 1958 and has kitschy figurines, egg breakfasts and home-squeezed orange juice so good it even made a movie cameo.\nThis diner has been around since 1960, located discretely on a corner by Yonge and Wellesley. It's interior has an old-fashioned, family-run feel, and breakfasts run all day here."}
{"id":"6e35d455-cae3-4893-97f9-58db5adf48d8","text":"I have pretty similar views on monetary policy as Ryan Avent, but I'm going to quibble slightly with this:\nAt the same time, a period of inflation above the Fed's 2% target would give the central bank more headroom to raise its benchmark interest rate. The higher the level of long-run nominal rates, the less likely rates are to fall back to zero the next time trouble strikes.\nBack in 2009, 2010, or 2011, it would have made sense to try to overshoot the 2% inflation target. But not today, with unemployment at 4.6%. If we pushed inflation above 2% when the economy is strong, then we'd have to shoot for under 2% inflation when the economy is weak. We'd be more likely to fall back to zero next time.\nIndeed, this is basically what went wrong in 2008. Inflation exceeded 2% during the housing boom. Thus, when the Fed needed to move aggressively to ease policy in 2008, they held back in fear of inflation (which ran above 2% during 2008). It would make more sense to shoot for below 2% inflation during booms, and above 2% inflation during recessions.\nRyan does have some forceful arguments for higher inflation, but I think they'd be more effective if couched in terms of a change in the inflation target. Thus, instead of calling for an overshoot of the 2% target by 1\/2%, it would make more sense to call for undershooting a new and higher 3% inflation target, by 1\/2%. Increasing the inflation target to 3% would indeed give the Fed more room to cut rates in the next recession, in a way that overshooting the 2% target would not. In addition, undershooting the target during a boom is more consistent with the spirit of NGDP targeting, which Ryan has previously endorsed.\nThis all might seem like a meaningless quibble; \"What difference does it make what we do to the target, as long as we get 2.5% inflation.\" In the very short run, it may make no difference. But if you don't make monetary policy decisions in the context of a clearly defined policy regime, then the economy is likely to be less stable, especially when we reach a turning point in the business cycle.\nAs always, this 3% inflation target is not my preferred option (I prefer NGDPLT). I'm just trying to illustrate what I think is the most fruitful approach for people with current views on policy that might be described as \"dovish.\""}

Two outs and two walks later, Kole Meyer would step up to the plate with the bases loaded where he smashed a line drive to the right field fence scoring all three runners and landing on second base.\nLincoln wouldn\u2019t waste any time as they struck back in the second where an error, three walks, and four singles would be good enough for five runs giving them a 6-3 lead. In the bottom half of the inning Merrill would be able to push across one run. A lead off single followed by a wild pitch put Mason Smith on second base, and with a line drive single to the outfield by Dan Duginski, Smith would score the last run of the game for Merrill.

{"id":"f7bc0d97-4fe9-4fa4-9d90-52119bfe3d1f","text":"The significance of Urdu in the freedom struggle is uncontested for most commentators on the literary history of India; yet such is the politics of language and such also is the power of steady misdirection that the role played by Urdu writers in the years leading up to independence and in its immediate aftermath in what came to be called Nehru\u2019s \u201cnation-building project\u201d, is often overlooked if not outright decried in the public domain.\nThere has always been a fringe element (now gaining ascendancy, alas) that has believed that with the taqseem or batwara of 1947, Urdu, the foreign or alien language, the language of the invaders, the language of Muslims went away to Pakistan and what stayed with us was ours: Hindi, the rashtra bhasha, the language of India. And even before the partition, it has been alleged, Urdu was content to wallow in the romantic tropes of shama-parwana and escapist fantasies in the Persian-Arabic dastaan tradition, whereas Hindi had an organic link with desh-bhakti and swaraj.\nSuch a wilfully-created binary is both untrue and criminally dangerous. Not only does it link language with religion but also belittles and discounts an entire literary tradition. A phalange of Urdu writers \u2013 those belonging to the powerful literary grouping known as the Progressive Writers\u2019 Association (PWA) that was most active from the 1930s to 1950s \u2013 as well as the loose cannons who did not believe in movements and associations and had no discernible ideological mooring produced a body of work that aided and abetted a growing sense of nationalism, or wataniyat as it was called in Urdu. What is more, this process started not in the years leading up to 1947, but actually in the build-up to 1857 in what is now seen as the First War of Independence.\nTurmoil in verse\nThe decline and dismantling of the Mughal Empire was accompanied by calamitous events, each more tragic than the other \u2013 such as the rape and pillage of Delhi by Nadir Shah; the repeated attacks by Ahmed Shah Abdali, the Marathas, the Rohillas; the annexation of Awadh in 1856, the killing of Nawab Siraj-ud Daulah by the British in the Battle of Plassey in 1757; the establishment of British control in Delhi in 1803, the annexation of Awadh in 1856; and, then the final nail in the coffin, the Revolt of 1857.\nThe Urdu poets took note of the disarray, mismanagement and decline and wrote about each of these incidents in voluminous verse. If anything, with each fresh catastrophe, they evolved a vocabulary to express their angst, clothing their sorrow and anger in a time-honoured repertoire of images and metaphors.\nSome favourite synonymns for the Beloved traditionally used in classical Urdu poetry \u2013 but (idol), sitamgar (tyrant), kafir (infidel), yaar (friend) \u2013 began to be used mockingly for the British. Poets deployed traditional images such as the gul-o-bulbul (the rose and the nightingale) to decry the wilderness that their lives had become, the desolation in Shahjanabad after the plunder and lootings, the lawlessness on the streets, the shabbiness of the once-handsome houses. Several poets were actively involved in the Uprising \u2013 such as Munir Shikohabadi, Fazl-e Haq Khairabadi and the emperor Bahadurshah Zafar himself.\nAnd so the Urdu poet continued in this vein \u2013 drawing sustenance from the burst of political energy that was released from the events of 1857, donning the mantle of the reformer and activist, speaking in the voice of a political commentator and a social analyst, and evolving a new understanding of wataniyat. But it was only with the dawn of a new century that hubb-e watani (love for the nation) as we understand it today, can be seen as a literary phenomena in Urdu. The poets who had chosen to stay silent immediately after the ghadar began to spread their wings and a range of new emotions can be found in the turn-of-the-century poetry \u2013 from overt expressions of hostility to British rule to sarcastic references to the presence of a tyrannical alien in one\u2019s midst.\nCall for revolution\nWith the coming of Gandhi and the first non-cooperation movement, something changed in the Urdu poet\u2019s psyche. Cries for revolution became more robust and a sense of nationhood stronger. Brij Naain Chakbast in Awaz-e Qaum (The Call of the Nation) is speaking for an entire generation when he is declaring:\nFrom the ground to the skies there are cries of Home Rule\nAnd the youthfulness of nationalism and the urge for Home Rule.\nIn Inquilab (Revolution), Asrar-ul Haq Majaz, the romantic-turned-revolutionary poet is predicting a bloody end to imperial rule long before 1947:\nKhatm ho jaane ko hai sarmayadaron ka nizam\nRang lane ko hai mazdooron ka josh-e inteqam\n... Khoon hi khoon hoga nigahein jis taraf ko jayeingi (The rule of the capitalists is about to end\nThe labourer\u2019s passion for vengeance is finally coming true\n...\nThere will be blood, only blood, everywhere)\nA study of the proscribed poetry of this period will reveal strong, unabashedly revolutionary, almost seditious, content: Hasrat Mohani \u2013 the poet who first used the slogan Inquilab Zindabad at a trade union rally in Calcutta in 1925 \u2013 is scathing about the so-called reforms introduced by the British as mere sops in a poem called Montagu Reforms; Zafar Ali Khan is mocking the excesses of colonial rule and the brutality of men like General Dwyer in Mazalim-e Punjab (The Victims of Punjab); Hashar Kashmiri is writing a sarcastic ode to Europe Shukriya Europe (Thank You Europe); Ehsan Danish is penning a rousing anthem of revolt Tarana-e Jihad (The Anthem of Jihad), and so on.\nTaken chronologically, these poems begin to reveal a certain pattern. Each successive milestone of brutality, suppression, inequality, unfairness \u2013 The Rowlatt Act, Jallianwala massacre, routine proscriptions and banning as well as imprisonments of poets and politicians alike \u2013 is producing voluminous poetry, polemics and posters in Urdu. The poets and publicists of the age are working in tandem: Urdu newspapers, journals and prose writers are echoing the call of the poets, and vice versa. The firebrand Josh Malihabadi (1898-1982), poet and editor of the influential Kaleem, jailed for his revolutionary poetry, is declaring:\nKaam hai mera taghiar naam hai mera shabab\nMera naam inquilab o inquilab o inquilab (My work is change, my name is youth\nMy cry is revolution, revolution, revolution)\nAs we inch towards partition, when the possibility of freedom becomes clearer, poets like Sahir Ludhianvi begin to seize the immense possibilities of social transformation that an event like freedom from the imperial yoke presents:\nIn kali sadiyon ke sar se jab raat ka aanchal dhalkega\nJab dukh ke badal pighlenge, jab sukh ka saaghar chhalkega\nJab ambar jhoom ke naachega, jab dharti naghme gayegi\nWoh subha kabhi to aayegi (When the veil of the night will slip from the brow of these dark centuries\nWhen the clouds of sorrow will melt and the goblet of joy will brim over\nWhen the skies will dance with delight, when the earth will sings songs\nSurely that morning will dawn some day)\nSweet freedom\nAll through the 1940s, several members of the PWA had been writing songs of freedom that linked the anti-colonial struggle with the freedom movement. So there was Majaz, the Keats of Urdu, expressing his longing for a better, more humane world, a world that will arise phoenix-like from the ashes of upheaval and change, in a poem using the metaphor of a train hurtling in the darkness tiled Rail where the train becomes a metaphor for change and rebellion:\nGoing ahead fearlessly with a typhoon-like thunder\nA rebellion in each motion\nSinging songs of mankind\u2019s greatness\nAnd even in a seemingly soft romantic poem such as Nazr-e Dil (To My Heart), Majaz cannot hide the yearning of his subversive heart:\nLet us together bring about a new revolution\nSpread ourselves over the world so that all eyes are on us\nThere was little doubt in the mind of most Urdu poets, especially the progressives, that the dawn that was awaited was going to be a red one. And, so, there was Makhdoom Mohiuddin, the poet from Hyderabad writing in Jang-e Azaadi (War of Independence):\nLo surkh savera aata hai, azaadi ka, azaadi ka\nGulnaar tarana gaata hai, azaadi ka, azaadi ka\nDekho parcham lehrata hai, azaadi ka azaadi ka (Look, the red dawn is coming, the red dawn of independence\nSinging the red anthem of independence, freedom and independence\nLook, the flag is waving of liberty, freedom and independence)\nAnd there is Kaifi Azmi, writing an ode to the new woman who must walk hand in hand with her mate, in Aurat, for independence will bring not merely freedom from foreign rule but freedom from all kinds of oppression including gender injustice:\nArise, my love, for now you must march with me\nFlames of war are ablaze in our world today...\nYou must burn in the fire of freedom with me\nBut as we shall see in the poetry being written after the partition, the red storm that Majaz had predicted became the red tide of blood \u2013 not revolution \u2013 as the country plunged into a horrific bloodbath, and the dawn of freedom became a night-bitten dawn. By far the most famous comment on the partition is contained in Subah-e Azaadi by Faiz:\nYeh daagh daagh ujala yeh shab-gazida sehr\nWoh intezar tha jiska yeh woh sehr to nahi (This patchy light, this night-bitten dawn\nThis is not the dawn we had been waiting for)\nLines of disenchantment\nFor some progressive poets, especially those who were members of the Communist Party, partition and the freedom that came in its wake was a \u201cfalse freedom\u201d. Taking the Party\u2019s line, many poets too spoke of the sense of inadequacy, the squandering of dreams that the dawn of freedom ushered in. Josh Malihabadi in a poem titled Maatam-e Azadi (The Lament for Freedom) written in 1948 strikes a sombre note:\nAi ham nafas! Fasana e Hindustan naa pooch\nApna gala kharosh-e tarranum se phat gaya\nTalwar se bacha, to rag-e gul se kat gaya (O friend, don\u2019t ask me for the tale of Hindustan\nOur throats were torn by the scratching of our songs\nWhen we escaped the sword, we were beheaded by the veins of the rose)\nMajaz too has lost some of his youthful ebullience by 1948 when he writes:\nHindu Muslim Sikh Eesai aman ke moti ro lenge\nKhoon ki holi khel chuke hain rang ke dhabbe dho lenge (Hindu Muslim Sikh and Christian will shed tears of peace\nHaving played Holi with blood, they will now wash off these stains)\nBy the time India celebrates its first Republic Day in 1950, Sahir Ludhianvi\u2019s disenchantment with the new republic is already palpable. In a poem titled Chhabees Janwary (26 January), Sahir invokes the beautiful dreams the nation had seen, dreams of a better tomorrow and asks:\nCome and let us ponder on this question\nWhatever happened to all those beautiful dreams?\nThe helpless cannot even afford a shroud to cover their nakedness\nWhatever happened to those promises of silks and brocades?\nThen there is Pandrah Agust (15 August) by Akhtarul Iman:\nYahi din hai jiske liye maine kati thee in ankhon mein raatein\nYahi seeli aab-e baqa, chasma noor hai, jalwa-e toor hai?\nIssi ke liye woh suhane, madhur, rasbhare geet gaye they maine? (Was it for this day that I had spent so many sleepless nights\nFor this damp water of eternity, this stream of light, this mountain of miracles\nWas it for this I had sung all those sweet, melodious songs...)\nDecrying war\nThe wounds of partition were revived after every war with Pakistan. Each time, the poet cautioned against war. Sahir, the most vocal pacifist says in a nazm titled Ai Sharif Insanon:\nJung to khud hi ek masla hai\nJang kyon masalon ka hal degi?\nAag aur khoon aaj bakhshegi\nBhook aur ehtiyaj kal degi (War itself is the problem\nHow can it then provide the solution?\nToday it will give fire and blood\nTomorrow it will bring hunger and beggary)\nIt is interesting how nationalism increasingly became a leitmotif in the years immediately after partition in Urdu poetry. There was the jingoistic hyper-nationalism that came in the wake of the Indo-Pak wars (some from the pen of progressive poet-lyricists who oscillated between pacifists and ardent militants in songs for films such as Hindustan Hamara Hai) and more nuanced acknowledgements for the need for peace and harmony. From Partition came the wars, and the subsequent need for dialogue and bhaichara, maintaining brotherhood, was the popular refrain in much of Urdu poetry in the years immediately after independence. I will rest my case with Guftagu by Ali Sardar Jafri, the Jnanpith Award winning poet who wrote:"}

The report focuses on small- to medium-size communities, and was provided exclusively to the Toronto Sun.\nThe report says CAOs are seeing a gap between what the public expects of local government and what they are prepared to pay for has grown. One participant told the authors \u201csomething has to give.\u201d\nThe report says councillors in those communities are hesitant to raise taxes or create new revenue streams to pay for the work which isn\u2019t surprising, he added.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of infrastructure put in the ground between 50 and 75 years ago,\u201d Matheson said, adding that years of deferring infrastructure work are catching up with communities.\nThe CAOs also expressed concern about the rise of a divisive brand of populism in city halls across Ontario. A number of councillors are mimicking U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s brash style, often publicly attacking bureaucrats and questioning their work.\n\u201c(Municipal governments) are not designed to have a somebody on council who is structurally opposing everything,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s contributing to only half of them saying they had good relations with their councils.\u201d\nThe interviews used for the report were conducted confidentially. The findings offer a rare, unvarnished view of major issues taking place in these towns and cities, said Ron Shaw, a senior advisor with Strategy Corp who co-authored the report.\nShaw, a former CAO with over 30 years experience in Stratford and Kincardine, said top municipal bureaucrats don\u2019t want to be critical of their communities publicly.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to say much different than what their councillors may be saying,\u201d he added. \u201cThey want to make sure they represent the views of the municipality. Speaking confidentially, they can speak to us ... and give honest, open feedback.\u201d\nReleasing the report at the Association of Municipalities of Ontario\u2019s annual meeting in Ottawa this week will help bring the concerns of the CAOs into focus, he said.\nMatheson added that the concerns raised in the report will need to be addressed through a variety of means, including the provision of more cash to municipalities.\nsjeffords@postmedia.com"}

The cannabinoid is used for a group of drugs that are structurally related to tetrahydrocannabinoids. It is synthetically manufactured by pharma companies to treat different type of indications, such as multiple sclerosis, migraine, arthritis, seizures, etc. Cannabinoid drugs are naturally isolated from cannabis and work on the endocannabinoid system of mammals. Other applications include their use as an anti-inflammatory agent as they modulate the cytokine cascade and psychoactive effect. Its psychoactive effect has been found to be moderately effective in treating traumatic brain injuries, neuropathic pain, arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Clinically, three cannabinoid drugs are approved for treatment. The first cannabinoid drug is nabilone, which is a CB1\/CB2 receptor agonist and is used for relieving nausea & vomiting. It is a synthetic analog of 9-tetrahydrocannabinol. Other drugs, such as dronabinol and Sativex, are used for treating AIDS-related anorexia and neuropathic pain in advanced cancer & multiple sclerosis patients, respectively. Anandamide, 2-Arachidonoylglycerol, Cannabigerol, Cannabichromene, Cannabinol, Cannabidiol, Tetrahydrocannabinol are clinically important cannabinoids used for medical treatment.\nRequest for sample Report: https:\/\/www.futuremarketinsights.com\/reports\/sample\/rep-gb-6913\nCannabinoid Drugs Market: Drivers and Restraints\nRising demand for cannabinoid drugs for treating chronic pain in different indications is expected to fuel the growth of the market. Presently, a limited number of cannabinoid drugs are approved for human use and this will create new opportunities for manufacturers who are involved in the development of cannabinoid drugs. Along with these, commercial use of cannabinoid drugs is increasing constantly due to changing government regulations. For example, cannabinoid drugs usage has been legalized in ten states of the U.S. and the federation of Australian government has formulated a new Narcotic Drug Amendment Bill 2016 to permit cultivation of cannabis for medical usage and research. The rapid advancement of technologies has led to substantial progress in developing cannabinoid drugs. For example, many recent studies have spoken in favor of cannabinoid drugs usage for the treatment of Alzheimers and cancer. All these factors will act as potential drivers, thereby boosting the burgeoning growth of the cannabinoid drugs market.\nHuge investments are being made for the development of cannabinoid drugs. However, these investment have only been able to fuel slow growth into the cannabinoid drugs market.

We are now the most unequal state in the entire country with both incredible wealth and extreme poverty. Half the kids in our upstate cities live below the poverty line. How did we let this happen?\" she said on the video.\n\"I love New York. I've never wanted to live anywhere else but something has to change. We want our government to work again - on health care, ending mass incarceration, fixing our broken subway.\n\"Together we can win this fight,\" finished the New York born and raised Nixon, who said she grew up with her mother in what she called \"a one-bedroom, fifth-floor walk-up\".\nNew York, the fourth most populous state in the United States, goes to the polls to elect a governor on November 6. But Nixon remains a left-field candidate with Mr Cuomo very much the favoured contender ahead of the Democratic Party primary on September 13.\nLEFT-FIELD CANDIDATE\nDespite the stardom brought by her role alongside Sarah Jessica Parker and Kim Cattrall on the wildly successful television comedy \"Sex and the City,\" which aired on HBO from 1998-2004 and spawned two spin-off movies, the actress lags far behind in the polls.\nA recent Siena College Research Institute poll found that Mr Cuomo is overwhelmingly favoured by Democrats over Nixon by 66 to 19 per cent.\nIt remains unclear how much Mr Cuomo may be damaged by the recent conviction of an aide for bribery. According to The New York Times, his name was mentioned 163 times during the eight-week federal trial.\nNixon worked for years as an actress before hitting the big-time with \"Sex and the City\" and won a Tony Award - America's most prestigious stage acting awards - for her role last year in play \"The Little Foxes.\"\nIn addition to the video, Nixon has set up a campaign fundraising page that echoes some of the language used by 2016 Democratic Party presidential contender Bernie Sanders who electrified the left before ultimately losing to Hillary Clinton.\nThe page stipulates that Nixon \"won't be accepting any corporate contributions\" and that \"instead our campaign will be powered by the people.\"\nThe mother of three is far from the first US actor to venture into politics.\nRepublican president Ronald Reagan got his political start after the world of entertainment as a two-term governor of California from 1967 to 1975.\nArnold Schwarzenegger, the Austrian-born body builder is another actor turned two-term California governor, who was in office from 2003-2011.\nFormer television comic Al Franken - for whom Nixon once campaigned - also served as Democratic senator of Minnesota from 2009 to 2018, until he was forced to step down over sexual misconduct allegations.\nAFP"}

Or \u2014 as is usually the case with the LSU baseball program that tends to dominate the television ratings as if it is Alabama football \u2014 he\u2019ll be able to run all night as the Tigers play the first prime time game of the CWS at 7 p.m. Saturday on ESPN against Florida State.\nMORE: Duplantis says veteran LSU \u2018not afraid\u2019 of pressure\nMORE: LSU\u2019s \u2018Fab Four\u2019 all drafted; Lange to start Omaha opener for Tigers\nAmazingly, TD Ameritrade\u2019s dimensions are exactly the same as good ole and now dead Rosenblatt Stadium \u2014 335 feet down the left field line, 375 to left center 408 to center field, 375 to right center and 335 down the right field line. There is more outfield green, though, and it just plays much bigger as it tends to be in a huge mass of dead air. It\u2019s like somebody put that dome from Stephen King\u2019s \u201cUnder The Dome\u201d right on top of it. Baseballs can come in, but they can\u2019t get out.\nRosenblatt was a home run park. It was on a hill. It was also a real ballpark. TD Ameritrade, which opened in 2011, feels like an NFL stadium \u2014 too much uniformity and bigness that just doesn\u2019t fit the college game. Sure, it has all the modern conveniences and technologies, but unfortunately not nearly as much atmosphere or air flow.\nWhen LSU won its first national championship in 1991 without juiced bats or balls or Gorilla Ball, it was a pitching first team that hit eight home runs in Rosenblatt in four games. In five games in TD Ameritrade through two trips in 2013 and \u201915, LSU has hit all of two home runs. Mason Katz hit one in the Tigers\u2019 first game in the stadium in 2013 in a 2-1 loss to UCLA, which hit .250 that year with 19 home runs and won the national championship. LSU hit .305 that year with 47 home runs but went home at 0-for-2.\nThen Jared Foster hit one in 2015 when the Tigers lost to TCU, 10-3, in the opener.\nThat\u2019s it.\nNot only LSU has died at the warning track of TD Ameritrade. In the last three seasons at Rosenblatt \u2014 2008-10 \u2014 an average of 2.4 home runs a game were hit. In 2011 at Ameritrade, 0.64 home runs were hit a game and 0.67 the next year. And it has not changed much since.\nIn other words, Watson is going to catch a lot of fly balls.\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to be something to see,\u201d LSU right fielder Greg Deichmann said. So will left fielder Antoine Duplantis, who would be playing center on probably every other team in the nation.\nDeichmann will be fun to watch as well. For a big guy, he can patrol right field very well, too. But he can also hit home runs. He has as many this season as UCLA hit in 2013 \u2014 19. Deichmann has also hit 13 home runs in TD Ameritrade. He went there last year as part of a Home Run Derby.\n\u201cWe were trying to hit home runs and perform at that,\u201d he said. \u201cI never try to hit home runs in real games. You just try to drive it, and if it goes, it goes.\u201d\nDeichmann also does not adjust his swing or approach based on the ballpark.\n\u201cThe minute you try to change to the stadium is the minute you stop having success,\u201d he said.\nThe great thing about Deichmann is that he is a home run hitter who doesn\u2019t have to be. He does not have to hit home runs to be dangerous to opponents. He has 12 doubles this season and hits for average as he is third on the team at .320. Of the regulars, the Tigers have five .300 hitters, three between .277 and .294 and just two around .260 \u2014 Michael Papierski at .260 and Jake Slaughter at .256. And Papierski has raised his average from .230 just over the last five weeks.\nThis will be the fastest, most athletic, most balanced and deepest pitching team LSU has ever taken to TD Ameritrade. The Tigers\u2019 chances of staying much longer than about a weekend as they did on their only two previous trips are very good.\nLSU is full of line drive hitters who don\u2019t strike out a lot, and that tends to work better in all that vastness in the outfield and dead air.\n\u201cI think top to bottom right now, throughout the whole lineup, we\u2019re just getting the job done,\u201d said Duplantis, who is a line drive machine and hitting .322 with 57 RBIs on just one home run. Those are perfect numbers for trade and commerce at TD Ameritrade.\n\u201cIt definitely helps having a bunch of athletes,\u201d Duplantis said. \u201cThat\u2019s really important in that kind of ballpark in Omaha. We hit singles and make plays on defense.\u201d\nThe biggest obstacle facing LSU in Omaha will be making sure it is not dead on arrival. This is what killed one of LSU\u2019s best teams in 2013. Two of its best and most consistent players did not show. Alex Bregman, a .369 hitter that season, went 0-for-8. Raph Rhymes, who hit .331, went 0-for-9.\nUndoubtedly, some of LSU\u2019s best hitters may experience something like that, but if enough others hit, the Tigers will be in Omaha long enough get to know virtually every inch of TD Ameritrade.\nGlenn Guilbeau covers LSU sports for the USA Today Network of Louisiana.

{"id":"92afeef3-f881-457a-8d6a-287319e4034f","text":"During the first few weeks of the Trump administration, we\u2019ve seen increased pressure on Muslim and immigrant communities in the United States.\nIn the face of these threats, which Marvel superhero might be best equipped to defend the people, ideals and institutions under attack? Some comic fans and critics are pointing to Kamala Khan, the new Ms. Marvel.\nKhan, the brainchild of comic writer G. Willow Wilson and editor Sana Amanat, is a revamp of the classic Ms. Marvel character (originally named Carol Danvers and created in 1968). First introduced in early 2014, Khan is a Muslim, Pakistani-American teenager who fights crime in Jersey City and occasionally teams up with the Avengers.\nSince Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, fans have created images of Khan tearing up a photo of the president, punching him (evoking a famous 1941 cover of Captain America punching Hitler) and grieving in her room. But the new Ms. Marvel\u2019s significance extends beyond symbolism.\nIn Kamala Khan, Wilson and Amanat have created a superhero whose patriotism and contributions to Jersey City emerge because of her Muslim heritage, not despite it. She challenges the assumptions many Americans have about Muslims and is a radical departure from how the media tend to depict Muslim-Americans. She shows how Muslim-Americans and immigrants are not forces that threaten communities \u2013 as some would argue \u2013 but are people who can strengthen and preserve them.\nSuperhero-in-training\nAfter inhaling a mysterious gas, Kamala Khan discovers she can stretch, enlarge, shrink and otherwise manipulate her body. Like many superheroes, she chooses to keep her identity a secret. She selects the Ms. Marvel moniker in homage to the first Ms. Marvel, Carol Danvers, who has since given up the name in favor of becoming Captain Marvel. Khan cites her family\u2019s safety and her desire to lead a normal life, while also fearing that \u201cthe NSA will wiretap our mosque or something.\u201d\nAs she wrestles with her newfound powers, her parents grow concerned about broken curfews and send her to the local imam for counseling. Rather than reinforcing her parents\u2019 curfew or prying the truth from Khan, though, Sheikh Abdullah says, \u201cI am asking you for something more difficult. If you insist on pursuing this thing you will not tell me about, do it with the qualities benefiting an upright young woman: courage, strength, honesty, compassion and self-respect.\u201d\nHer experience at the mosque becomes an important step on her journey to superheroism. Sheikh Abdullah contributes to her education, as does Wolverine. Islam is not a restrictive force in her story. Instead, the religion models for Khan many of the traits she needs in order to become an effective superhero. When her mother learns the truth about why her daughter is sneaking out, she \u201cthank[s] God for having raised a righteous child.\u201d\nThe comics paint an accurate portrait of Jersey City. Her brother Aamir is a committed Salafi (a conservative and sometimes controversial branch of Sunni Islam) and member of his university\u2019s Muslim Student Association. Her best friend and occasional love interest, Bruno, works at a corner store and comes from Italian roots. The city\u2019s diversity helps Kamala as she learns to be a more effective superhero. But it also rescues her from being a stand-in for all Muslim-American or Jersey City experiences.\nFighting a \u2018war on terror culture\u2019\nKamala\u2019s brown skin and costume \u2013 self-fashioned from an old burkini \u2013 point to Marvel Comics\u2019 desire to diversify its roster of superheroes (as well as writers and artists). As creator Sana Amanat explained on \u201cLate Night With Seth Meyers\u201d last month, representation is a powerful thing, especially in comics. It matters when readers who feel marginalized can see people like themselves performing heroic acts.\nAs one of 3.3 million Muslim-Americans, Khan flips the script on what Moustafa Bayoumi, author of \u201cThis Muslim American Life,\u201d calls a \u201cwar on terror culture\u201d that sees Muslim-Americans \u201cnot as complex human being[s] but only as purveyor[s] of possible future violence.\u201d\nBayoumi\u2019s book echoes other studies that detail the heightened suspicion and racial profiling Muslim-Americans have faced since 9\/11, whether it\u2019s in the workplace or interactions with the police. Each time there\u2019s been a high-profile terrorist attack, these experiences, coupled with hate crimes and speech, intensify. Political rhetoric \u2013 like Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to have a Muslim registry or his lie that thousands of Muslims cheered from Jersey City rooftops after the Twin Towers fell \u2013 only fans the flames.\nScholars of media psychology see this suspicion fostered, in part, by negative representations of Muslims in both news media outlets and popular culture, where they are depicted as bloodthirsty terrorists or slavish informants to a non-Muslim hero.\nThese stereotypes are so entrenched that a single positive Muslim character cannot counteract their effects. In fact, some point to the dangers of \u201cbalanced\u201d representations, arguing that confronting stereotypes with wholly positive images only enforces a simplistic division between \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d Muslims.\nUnbreakable\nKamala Khan, however, signals an important development in cultural representations of Muslim-Americans. It\u2019s not just because she is a powerful superhero instead of a terrorist. It\u2019s because she is, at the same time, a clumsy teenager who makes a mountain of mistakes while trying to balance her abilities, school, friends and family. And it\u2019s because Wilson surrounds Kamala with a diverse assortment of characters who demonstrate the array of heroic (and not-so-heroic) actions people can take.\nFor example, in one of Ms. Marvel\u2019s most powerful narrative arcs, a planet attacks New York, leading to destruction eerily reminiscent of 9\/11. Kamala works to protect Jersey City while realizing that her world has changed \u2013 and will change \u2013 irrevocably.\nCarol Danvers appears to fill Kamala in on the gravity of the situation, telling her, \u201cThe fate of the world is out of your hands. It always was. But your fate \u2013 what you decide to do right now \u2013 is still up to you \u2026 Today is the day you stand up.\u201d Kamala connects the talk with Sheikh Abdullah\u2019s lectures about the value of one\u2019s deeds, once again linking her superhero and religious training to rise to the occasion. In both cases, the lectures teach Kamala to take a stand to protect her community.\nArriving at the high school gym now serving as a safe haven for Jersey City residents, Kamala realizes her friends and classmates have been inspired by her heroism. They safely transport their neighbors to the gym while outfitting the space with water, food, dance parties and even a \u201cnon-denominational, non-judgmental prayer area.\u201d The community response prompts Kamala to realize that \u201ceven if things are profoundly not okay, at least we\u2019re not okay together. And even if we don\u2019t always get along, we\u2019re still connected by something you can\u2019t break. Something there isn\u2019t even a word for. Something \u2026 beautiful.\u201d\nKamala Khan is precisely the hero America needs today, but not because of a bat sign in the sky or any single definitive image. She is, above all, committed to the idea that every member of her faith, her generation, and her city has value and that their lives should be respected and protected. She demonstrates that the most heroic action is to face even the most despair-inducing challenges of the world head on while standing up for \u2013 and empowering \u2013 every vulnerable neighbor, classmate or stranger. She shows us how diverse representation can transform into action and organization that connect whole communities \u201cby something you can\u2019t break.\u201d"}

In the run up to that historic anniversary, we take a look back at some significant incidents and snippets from that time - from newspapers coverage to little-known facts, individual acts of heroism to how the actions of those who lost their lives changed history.\nMichael Collins and \u00c9amon De Valera are two of the most iconic figures in Irish history, both strongly commended in the country\u2019s struggle for independence.\nMany historically-minded people also stand firmly in either of the two camps\u2014Collins or De Valera\u2014that mark the opposition to the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921 (De Valera) or the pro-Treaty side of the Civil War (Collins).\nEoghan Plunkett, however, would describe one as a \u201cpup\u201d and \"a nasty piece of work\" the other a \u201cpain in the arse\u201d and a \u201cme-F\u00e9iner\u201d (a play on \u201cSinn F\u00e9in\u201d meaning \u201courselves,\u201d \u201cm\u00e9-F\u00e9in\u201d is the Irish for \u201cmyself,\u201d implying that de Valera only looked after himself).\nPlunkett, now aged 86 and a resident of TLC Citywest nursing home in Dublin is the living legacy of one of Ireland\u2019s most revolutionary families: the Plunketts.\nEoghan\u2019s uncle was Joseph Mary Plunkett, one of the leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising and a signatory of the Proclamation of Independence. He was famously executed for his role in the 1916 Rising in Kilmainham Gaol just hours after marrying his sweetheart Grace Gifford in the prison\u2019s chapel.\nEoghan\u2019s own father George Plunkett was also sentenced to death for his participation in the Rising, as was his other uncle Jack. In the end, they were not executed and his father and uncle Jack were to later become important IRA men, taking the anti-Treaty side during the Civil War.\n2\nEoghan told the Irish Times that there was a photo of the pair in one of the newspapers not long after they had both been sentenced to death for taking part in the Rising. In the photograph, the two men are standing with \u201cbig broad grins on their faces.\u201d \u201cHow the hell can you smile like that?\u201d Eoghan questioned.\nEoghan\u2019s grandfather, Count George Noble Plunkett, was also a significant Irish figure, winning a by-election for Sinn F\u00e9in in Roscommon in 1917, and other family members included Archbishop Oliver Plunkett and Horace Plunkett, a Protestant and Unionist who worked at reconciling Unionists and Nationalists.\nWith the 1916 centenary approaching, Nursing Home Ireland (NHI) sought residents who had lived through the Rising and its aftermath and could give first-hand evidence and insight into the political and social scene in Ireland a hundred years ago. Few had as great an insight as Eoghan Plunkett.\nAs a member of one of Ireland\u2019s notable revolutionary families, Eoghan had personal experiences of family members dealing with some of Ireland\u2019s greatest historical figures.\nDespite his father\u2019s alliance with the anti-Treaty side during the Civil War, the anti-Treaty leader De Valera was not held in very high regard in the Plunkett household.\n\u201cHe was a pain in the arse,\u201d Eoghan says. \u201c[My father] was put on the run by de Valera. As far as he was concerned, de Valera just fixed things for himself. He was a m\u00e9 f\u00e9iner. \u201d\nThere was little talk of the events that preceded the Civil War from his father and Joseph Plunkett and the events of the Rising were not discussed at great length among the family. \u201cHe knew all he needed to know,\u201d Eoghan said of his father. \u201cHe was more interested in what it meant than what happened.\u201d\n\u201cThe one thing about Joseph Mary is that he was thoroughly admired by his family. People like my Da and Jack adored him and put him on a pedestal, and that was long before he died.\u201d\nEoghan\u2019s mother was also in contact with the other side of the Treaty conflict and his stories of the \u201cThe Big Fellow,\u201d while slightly tarnishing the hero image of Collins, give his life a beautifully human context.\nEoghan, the former advertising executive, and Labour Party backroom worker says, \u201cI have to explain to you that my mother knew Mick [Michael] Collins very well. He had an office in her flat and she despised him. He was a pup, a nasty piece of work.\u201d\n\u201cWhenever he came into their livingroom, the carpet on the livingroom floor was surrounded by a timber floor, but he walked on the timber part. Why? Because it made more noise. That\u2019s the sort of fellow that he was. She and he were both from west Cork; she recognized him for what he was.\u201d\nSurely this can\u2019t be the same heroic Collins? When asked by the Times if he thought Collins was one of Ireland\u2019s greatest men, \u201cNot in our eyes\u201d was his response.\nDespite his family\u2019s involvement in the Rising and in its aftermath, and his father\u2019s involvement in the bombing campaign in England up until the Second World War began in 1939, Eoghan did not follow in his footsteps and opposed the IRA throughout the Troubles.\nHe still feels that those lost in the Rising should be remembered, however. \u201cMost of them were totally honest and decent,\u201d he concludes.\nH\/T: The Irish Times.\n* Originally published in 2016."}

Claiming his party always strikes a balance in its approach towards electoral victory and defeat, he highlights the BJP\u2019s organisational strength in MP and the popularity of its Chief Minister in an interview with The Sunday Standard.\nAs the newly appointed ICCR president, he says that cultural diplomacy is important for development diplomacy but that terror and cultural ties cannot go together in the case of Pakistan.\nStating that the BJP will take cognisance of any weakness in efforts to reach the Modi regime\u2019s achievements to the people, party vice-president Vinay Sahasrabuddhe told The Sunday Standard in an exclusive interview that the BJP strikes a balance in its approach towards victory and defeat without getting carried away by the poll outcome. The newly appointed ICCR president also said the Council will chart out a course to capitalise on cultural diplomacy for development diplomacy but that terror and cultural ties cannot go together in the case of Pakistan.\nHow do you take the Gujarat election verdict considering the BJP could stay in power only with much reduced strength? Will the verdict affect the BJP?\nThe impact of the Gujarat elections will be more on opposition parties than on the BJP. The Congress had mobilised many forces and sought to cause disaffection in various sections of society. Despite all such measures, they didn\u2019t succeed in Gujarat. But within the BJP, we analyse the reasons for success and failure alike. Indeed, success is success. It\u2019s a fact that we have won Gujarat. It\u2019s also true that the BJP\u2019s vote percentage has gone up. But we know that the strength of the party in terms of Assembly seats has gone down. If there had been any shortcomings in communicating the government\u2019s achievements to the people, we will take due cognisance.\nMaharashtra witnessed a Dalit agitation recently. How is the BJP gearing up to address social tensions?\nPolitical pundits and intellectuals should know that there has been a tradition of resorting to populism and divisive agenda in electoral politics under the first-past-the-post system as per the Westminster model of democracy. It has been seen that the Congress has a tendency to take recourse to divisive politics and unleash casteism when people decisively and passionately go for politics of development. And people know that the copyright for the term \u2018politics of development\u2019 is with the BJP only. Indeed, it\u2019s a challenge for the BJP to overcome politics of division through a substantive development narrative.\nBeing in charge of Madhya Pradesh, do you think there could be Gujarat-like challenges for the party?\nWe take each and every election seriously. We aren\u2019t people who spend two months abroad on vacations and then plunge into electioneering. We don\u2019t have such a trivialising approach towards politics. Indeed, Gujarat is Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh is Madhya Pradesh. We have strong organisational strength in the state since the times of Kushabhao Thakre and Rajmata Scindia. Besides, there also is a very popular Chief Minister in the state in Shivraj Singh Chouhan.\nFormer Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Digvijaya Singh is undertaking a Narmada Yatra. Do you see any political meaning?\nDigvijaya Singh hasn\u2019t yet renounced politics. Though Narmada parikrama is his spiritual project as stated, there will indeed be political overtones as long as he is in politics.\nIt is said that the BJP wins elections in Madhya Pradesh because of factionalism in the Congress in the state...\nThe Congress has a culture of one family at its core and 25 other families who dominate states. Unlike them, we seek and get the mandate of the people on the basis of the strength of the party organisation.\nWhat has been the impact of demonetisation and GST rollout on state elections?\nThe Prime Minister, Finance Minister and the BJP president have all expressed their views on demonetisation and GST. The Prime Minister doesn\u2019t practise politics of populism. He seeks to cultivate people\u2019s acceptance for initiatives which will be in their interest and in national interest. Both demonetisation and GST were in the interest of the people. The decisions were taken with the long-term interest of the nation at the top of the decision-makers\u2019 minds. Politics is all about cultivating people\u2019s mind towards issues of public interest.\nHow do you look upon your role as ICCR president and what agenda are you setting out with?\nThe ICCR has a long history and rich tradition, besides distinguished personalities gracing the institution in the past. I am aware of the legacy on which I would like to build upon further.\nThe diplomatic, or rather political diplomacy, has to be taken through cultural diplomacy for development diplomacy. We have to create an enlightened opinion about India among opinion-makers of the world. The agenda of the ICCR need not be confined to a very skewed concept of culture. The culture has an element of art and entertainment. But along with classical music, dance and Yoga, there are many traditional art forms, including tribal Warli art of Maharashtra, Pattachitra of Odisha and Bihu dance of Assam, which could and should also be showcased on international platforms. It should ensure that all sections in the nook and corner of the country are represented to give more comprehensive understanding of the country. India is no more known as a country of snake-charmers. But we have to create a more informed opinion and enlightened environment hereon by utilising the services of theatre, actors, poets, musicians, and authors as well as thinkers. The ICCR would be taking up relevant productive and result oriented projects.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has also sought to engage the global community during his foreign tours. How is the ICCR seeking to complement India\u2019s search for global footprints?\nOne can be reasonably confident that people-to-people contact is on the top of the agenda of the Prime Minister. The NRIs, with their culinary and spiritual traditions, have created fertile grounds abroad. From global for a, the Prime Minister has asked about the need to go beyond G-20 and G-8 to G-all. This is the unique thing about the Prime Minister. So, with this kind of Prime Minister who has a vision for uniting the world community, the ICCR definitely will be looking to play a meaningful role.\nThe NRI community has of late become the target audience for political discourse. Congress president Rahul Gandhi was first in the US and then in Bahrain...\nI think the government position is clear that nobody can object to leaders of opposition parties going abroad. But playing partisan politics even from foreign soil is not acceptable.\nOn the day of his swearing-in, the Prime Minister had demonstrated his priority for the immediate neighbourhood. Will there be strong cultural ties with Pakistan?\nThe role of the ICCR is global, which also takes care of neighbourhood. But you can\u2019t have cultural ties disregarding concerns of terror. Therefore, terror and cultural ties cannot go together.\nIndia has historical ties with China. Yet, bilateral relations are overshadowed by border tensions...\nIndia-China relations have a chequered history. There have been incidents of incursions on the border. They have also been raising issues about the visit of our political and spiritual leaders to Arunachal Pradesh. Notwithstanding all these incidents, our multi-dimensional ties continue to get a push from both countries."}

As CNET spotted, Apple posted about the security updates on its support site. To get protected, check for new updates in the App Store.\nBack at the start of January, Apple said it had already protected users against Meltdown in macOS High Sierra.\nIf you're running a version of Apple's desktop operating system prior to El Capitan, of course, you're out of luck here.\nThere are still no known exploits levelled against Meltdown (or the other big bug, Spectre, which affects other processors, not just Intel), but the likelihood is that the bad guys out there may be close to weaponizing an exploit.\nStability Woes\nOf course, at the beginning of the week, Intel warned against installing 'current versions' of Meltdown and Spectre patches in general -- following instability problems that have hit some PCs -- but presumably that caveat doesn't pertain to these patches from Apple.\nIntel's aforementioned warning applied to manufacturers and software developers as well as end-users, and if these fixes were problematic, you'd hope Apple wouldn't have released them yet -- plus these mitigations have already been applied to High Sierra at the start of the month, as mentioned, with no apparent issues.\nStill, given Intel's warning, some of the more cautious folks out there may still be a little reticent to go ahead and patch, and may feel that it's prudent to wait a little longer, at least while there isn't a known exploit being leveraged against Meltdown -- which just underlines how much of a PR nightmare this thing is turning into for Intel.\nEnter stage left Linus Torvalds to chuck just a little more fuel onto the fire from a Linux perspective. As Extremetech reports, he called Intel's fixes for these bugs \"complete and utter garbage,\" never being one to mince his words.\nAccording to emails he has sent, Torvalds is particularly unhappy about the Spectre fix for Linux machines, accusing it of being bloated and containing 'redundant junk,' and also criticizing it for being optional, among other things. Not a happy bunny doesn't quite cover it.\n\u00a9 2018 T-break Tech under contract with NewsEdge\/Acquire Media.

The doors of the upstairs main hall will open at 12 noon and dinner will be served until 2 p.m.\nThe traditional Christmas Day gathering began life 11 years ago as a venue for military families with loved ones deployed overseas who had no place to go for a holiday meal. It has branched into an event inviting the entire community especially folks who won't have family around for the holidays. Kim Clouthier, a member of the organizing committee, said the Christmas Angels are grateful that they are able to bring the dinner back.\n\u201cFrom the kindness of many supporters in the town and many volunteers, we are able to put together a Christmas dinner again,\u201d said Clouthier. \u201cIt's for anyone who is alone or for anyone who wants to come out for some Christmas cheer.\u201d\nAt its height during the Afghanistan combat mission, Petawawa was deploying more than 2,000 troops to Kandahar, with most of those tours coinciding with the holiday season. The luncheon would have served as many as 300 people during that time. With the garrison gearing up for NATO deployments to Latvia and the Ukraine, and with local troops still in Iraq and Kuwait, the Angels hope to help out military families.\n\u201cWe started this with the first deployment to Afghanistan and started it for the military and the town,\u201d said Gloria Deane-Freeman, who has been a driving force behind the dinner since its inception, along with Clouthier and Theresa Sabourin. \u201cSo we want to encourage that for sure.\u201d\nThe Christmas Angels dinner promises the same festive atmosphere that has made it popular in the past. The meal will be prepared by Schmidt's Catering, while Hyska's Independent Grocer is a major sponsor and donor. Organizers said they have received financial support from many donors who wish to remain anonymous but wanted to see the dinner came back. This year they expect between 250 and 300 guests.\nMusic will be provided by the Madill Family, who have been a staple at dinners-past. The committee promises a special appearance from Santa Claus, who has agreed to stop by on his way back to the North Pole after his Christmas Eve journey around the world.\n\u201cIt's a fun and glorious day where people who normally don't get dressed up to go somewhere have a place to go,\u201d added Clouthier. \u201cThey can enjoy the good food, the music and the nice people who are going to be here.\u201d\nThere is no requirement to RSVP. The Angels just want folks to stop in. Dinners will be delivered to those within Petawawa who have limited mobility, who are suffering from illness or are shut-ins. To order a delivered dinner, called Theresa at 613-687-2429.\nSChase@postmedia.com"}

This began during the end of the Industrial Revolution, and both industries were thriving, but one didn\u2019t last as long as the other. The silk industry rapidly found itself unraveling.\nAt its peak, Allentown was the number one silk city in America, but the industry began to slowly die with the Great Depression, in addition to the competition from the south where labor was cheaper. Plus, there was the appeal and popularity of synthetic fibers like nylon and rayon, which are less expensive and labor-intensive to manufacture. By 1953, the number of silk looms in the Lehigh Valley decreased 80 percent, leaving just six remaining.\nBut one of those mills\u2014Easton\u2019s R&H Simon Silk Mill\u2014has a long story.\nBrought to life by Robert and Herman Simon in 1883, the R&H Simon Silk Mill went from about 250 employees to some 2,000. Business was thriving, even after the death of the Simon brothers in 1901. The mill was managed by other people and corporations before the silk market dwindled. The factory completely stopped running around the late 1960s.\nFast-forward to decades later\u20142006\u2014when a new hope came to the mill. The building was acquired by the Easton Redevelopment Authority with the intentions of turning it into a creative working space. In 2010, developers Mark Mulligan and William Vogt of VM Development took on the challenge to transform the mill. Construction finally began by mid-2015.\nRight now, the mill is a thriving living and working space that includes high-end apartments in addition to several small businesses, making it a unique and dynamic community.\nThe shops are a diverse collection for sure, including a caf\u00e9 and soon-to-be wine bar, a gallery and design studio, hair and makeup artistry, breweries, and more. Here\u2019s a quick look at just a few current businesses living in the mill."}

The Skripals eventually recovered from the poisoning.\nThe British government at the time accused the Russian government of facilitating the attack on the British soil, sparking a major diplomatic standoff and expulsion of dozens of diplomats from both countries. Russia denied any involvement in the poisoning.\nPolice on Wednesday were cordoning off places the exposed pair visited before becoming ill and they will remain closed overnight as a precaution.\nThe authorities initially suspected the two people got ill after using \u201cpossibly heroin or crack cocaine from a contaminated batch of drugs,\u201d AFP reported.\n\u201cHowever, further testing is now ongoing to establish the substance which led to these patients becoming ill and we are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances surrounding this incident,\u201d it added.\nPublic health officials said it\u2019s unlikely the wider public is in danger.\n\u201cThe current advice from PHE England, based upon the number of casualties affected, is that it is not believed that there is a significant health risk to the wider public.

Some but not all of its standards are compulsory. Its latest guidance on the carriage of computers is just a recommendation.\nPOWER OFF\n* Computer devices packed in checked baggage \"have to be completely switched off and effectively protected from accidental activation,\" EASA says.\n* To ensure that the devices do not turn on by mistake, passengers must not only switch them off, but ensure that any applications, alarms or settings that might accidentally awaken the machines during flight are disabled or deactivated.\nPACKAGING\n* Computers should be protected from damage with \"suitable packaging or casing\" or placed in a rigid bag protected by adequate cushioning, which could include clothing, EASA says.\nWORKAROUND WARNING\n* Gulf airlines have announced workarounds allowing premium passengers to keep their devices right up to the boarding gate, and then to hand them over so that they can be stowed in the hold alongside checked luggage.\n* But EASA is concerned that this should not allow too many laptops to be stored together - a concentration of lithium-powered devices that raises the prospect of similar fire hazards to cargo shipments, which are subject to special controls.\n* EASA therefore lays down guidelines that could increase the amount of time it takes to store and retrieve the devices. Cabin crew must not simply collect them and put them all in one place. They must be \"dispersed\" in the hold and should not be in one container. They should also be kept away from other dangerous goods.\nSPARE BATTERIES\n* EASA also issues a reminder to airlines that the carriage of spare batteries, power banks and e-cigarettes are forbidden inside checked baggage under global aviation rules.\n(Compiled by Tim Hepher, editing by G Crosse)"}
