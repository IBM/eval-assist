# Example 1: `example_grammatical-acceptability.py`

## Data specification

### Dataset 

This example concerns labeling of sentences on "grammatical acceptability", see Warstadt et al., 2019 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12471). In-context examples and 
test (reference) examples are extracted from the corresponding Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA) dataset 
(https://nyu-mll.github.io/CoLA/).

### Labeled data

Labeled data (`data/grammatical-acceptability/data_labeled.csv`) consists of 200 sentences, each with 5 
human annotations on the sentence's grammatical acceptability. 

Schema for `data_labeled.csv`:
- `id` (`string`): unique identifier for the sentence.
- `input_sentence` (`string`): a sentence.
- `label_acceptability_{i}` (`string`): annotator `i`'s grammatical acceptability label for `input_sentence`. Values: `acceptable`, `unacceptable`.

where `i=0,1,2,3,4` indexes the human annotator.

### Unlabeled data

Unlabeled data (`data/grammatical-acceptability/data_unlabeled.csv`) consists of 8551 sentences.

Schema for `data_unlabeled.csv`:
- `id` (`string`): unique identifier for the sentence
- `input_sentence` (`string`): a sentence 

## Labeler setup

### Rubrics

The `rubrics` dictionary for this example contains a single `acceptability` dimension. The criteria definitions are from Warstadt et al., 2019.

    rubrics = {
        "acceptability": {
            "requirement": "grammatical acceptability",
            "criteria": {  
                "acceptable": "The sentence does not contain morphological anomalies (i.e., mismatches in verbal inflection), syntactic anomalies (i.e., wh-movement out of extraction islands), or semantic anomalies (i.e., violations of animacy requirements of verbal arguments).",
                "unacceptable": "The sentence contains morphological anomalies (i.e., mismatches in verbal inflection), syntactic anomalies (i.e., wh-movement out of extraction islands), or semantic anomalies (i.e., violations of animacy requirements of verbal arguments)."
            }
        },
    }


### Output format

The `output_format` list for this example indicates that we want the model to generate a `label` and an associated `explanation`.

    output_format = [
        {
            "name": "label",
            "description": "label for the requirement"
        },
        {
            "name": "explanation",
            "description": "explanation for the label"
        }
    ]


### Instruction

The instruction describes that the model should use the criteria to label the sentence. 

    instruction = "Please use the criteria to label the following sentence."


### Data splits

The example dataset (`data_examples`) and the test dataset (`data_test`) are extracted from the labeled data via the 
function `example_test_split` using `example_size=0.3` (example set contains `60 = 0.3*200` sentences).

    datapath = "data/grammatical-acceptability"  # name of directory where data is located
    data_examples, data_test = example_test_split(labeled_data_path=os.path.join(datapath, "data_labeled.csv"),
                                                  rubrics=rubrics,
                                                  examples_size=0.3)
    data_unlabeled = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(datapath, "data_unlabeled.csv"))


### Defining and running the labeler 

The labeler instance is defined as follows: 

    model_id = "meta-llama/llama-3-8b-instruct"
    labeler = MachineLabeler(model_id=model_id,
                             instruction=instruction,
                             rubrics=rubrics,
                             output_format=output_format,
                             data_examples=data_examples,
                             num_example_samples=2,
                             num_prompt_samples=5)

The unlabeled data is labeled via the following command:

    labeler.label(data_unlabeled, save_dir=f"../labels/{datapath}/{model_id}")

The labeling accuracy (on the test set) is evaluated via:

    evaluation = labeler.evaluate(data_test, save_dir=f"../labels/{datapath}/{model_id}/test")
    print(evaluation)



# Example 2: `example_deontological-ethics.py`

## Data specification

### Dataset 

This example studies a model's ability to label with respect to deontological ethics, i.e., the ability to distinguish
between right and wrong based on a collection of rules. Data for this is example is from https://github.com/hendrycks/ethics 
and consists of a "scenario", an "excuse", and a binary label indicating if the excuse is reasonable/unreasonable for
the scenario.

### Labeled data

Labeled data (`data/deontological-ethics/data_labeled.csv`) consists of 18164 scenario-excuse pairs, each with a binary 
label indicating if the excuse is "reasonable" for the scenario. 

Schema for `data_labeled.csv`:
- `id` (`string`): unique identifier for the sentence.
- `input_scenario` (`string`): a sentence illustrating the scenario.
- `input_excuse` (`string`): a sentence describing the excuse.
- `label_reasonableness` (`string`): reasonableness of the excuse for the scenario. Values: `reasonable`, `unreasonable`.


### Unlabeled data

## Labeler setup

### Rubrics

The `rubrics` dictionary for this example contains a single `reasonableness` dimension. Definitions are derived from Hendrycks et al., 2021 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.02275).

    rubrics = {
        "reasonableness": {
            "requirement": "deontological reasonableness",
            "criteria": {  
                "reasonable": "The excuse justifiably overrides the initial scenario's obligation by appropriately balancing all relevant duties and circumstances.",
                "unreasonable": "The excuse unjustifiably overrides the initial scenario's obligation, disregarding more critical duties or constraints."
            }
        },
    }


### Output format

The `output_format` list for this example indicates that we want the model to generate a `label` and an associated `explanation`.

    output_format = [
        {
            "name": "label",
            "description": "label for the requirement"
        },
        {
            "name": "explanation",
            "description": "explanation for the label"
        }
    ]


### Instruction

The instruction describes that the model should use the criteria to label the sentence. 

    instruction = "Please use the criteria to label the following excuse for the scenario."


### Data splits

The example dataset (`data_examples`) and the test dataset (`data_test`) are extracted from the labeled data via the 
function `example_test_split` using `example_size=0.1` (example set contains `1816 = 0.1*18164` sentences).

    datapath = "data/deontological-ethics"  # name of directory where data is located
    data_examples, data_test = example_test_split(labeled_data_path=os.path.join(datapath, "data_labeled.csv"),
                                                  rubrics=rubrics,
                                                  examples_size=0.3)


### Defining and running the labeler 

The labeler instance is defined as follows: 

    model_id = "meta-llama/llama-3-8b-instruct"
    labeler = MachineLabeler(model_id=model_id,
                             instruction=instruction,

The labeling accuracy (on the test set) is evaluated via:

    evaluation = labeler.evaluate(data_test, save_dir=f"../labels/{datapath}/{model_id}/test")
    print(evaluation)




# Example 3: `example_summarization.py`

## Data specification

### Dataset 

This example studies a model's ability to label summaries across four dimensions (`coherence`, 
`consistency`, `fluency`, and `relevance`). Data contains summaries and human labels across the dimensions from the
"human annotation file" (see: https://github.com/Yale-LILY/SummEval) with corresponding original text (articles) from 
the `CNN Questions` dataset (https://cs.nyu.edu/~kcho/DMQA/). 

Note that this example contains *no unlabeled data*; the example focuses on analyzing a model's accuracy across the 
labeled dimensions.

### Labeled data

Labeled data (`data/summarization/data_labeled.csv`) consists of 1600 article-summary pairs (16 summaries across 100 
articles), each with a 4-dimensional label from three human 
annotators.

`data_labeled.csv`:
- `id`: unique identifier for the (article, summary) pair.
- `input_article`: the original (unsummarized) text.
- `input_summary`: a summary of `input_article`.
- `label_coherence_{i}`: the collective quality of all sentences (values: integer from 1 (worst) to 5 (best)).
- `label_consistency_{i}`: the consistency of the facts between the article and the summary (1 to 5).
- `label_fluency_{i}`: the (grammatical) quality of individual sentences (1 to 5).
- `label_relevance_{i}`: the summary's faithfulness to the key points in the article (1 to 5).

where `i=0,1,2` indexes the human annotator. 

## Labeler setup

### Rubrics

The `rubrics` dictionary contains a rubric for each of the four dimensions. Criteria are defined to match the 5-point
(worst to best) scale in the labeled data. In this example, it is useful to use the `labeling_notes` field to inform
the model of the appropriate definitions (from https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.12626 and https://duc.nist.gov/pubs/2005papers/OVERVIEW05.pdf).

    rubrics = {
        "coherence": {
            "requirement": "coherence of the summary",
            "criteria": {  
                "1": "The summary's coherence is very poor, i.e., 1 out of 5.",
                "2": "The summary's coherence is poor, i.e., 2 out of 5.",
                "3": "The summary's coherence is barely acceptable, i.e., 3 out of 5.",
                "4": "The summary's coherence is good, i.e., 4 out of 5.",
                "5": "The summary's coherence is very good, i.e., 5 out of 5."
            },
            "labeling_notes": [
                "Coherence reflects the collective quality of all sentences in the summary. The summary should not just be a heap of related information, but should build from sentence to sentence to a coherent body of information about a topic."
            ]
        },
        "consistency": {
            "requirement": "consistency of the summary",
            "criteria": {  
                "1": "The summary's consistency is very poor, i.e., 1 out of 5.",
                "2": "The summary's consistency is poor, i.e., 2 out of 5.",
                "3": "The summary's consistency is barely acceptable, i.e., 3 out of 5.",
                "4": "The summary's consistency is good, i.e., 4 out of 5.",
                "5": "The summary's consistency is very good, i.e., 5 out of 5."
            },
            "labeling_notes": [
                "Coherence reflects factual alignment between the summary and the article. A factually consistent summary contains only statements that are entailed by the article (inclusion of false information should be penalized)."
            ]
        },
        "fluency": {
            "requirement": "fluency of the summary",
            "criteria": {  
                "1": "The summary's fluency is very poor, i.e., 1 out of 5.",
                "2": "The summary's fluency is poor, i.e., 2 out of 5.",
                "3": "The summary's fluency is barely acceptable, i.e., 3 out of 5.",
                "4": "The summary's fluency is good, i.e., 4 out of 5.",
                "5": "The summary's fluency is very good, i.e., 5 out of 5."
            },
            "labeling_notes": [
                "Fluency reflects the quality of individual sentences. A fluent summary should have no formatting problems, capitalization errors or obviously ungrammatical sentences (e.g., fragments, missing components) that make the text difficult to read."
            ]
        },
        "relevance": {
            "requirement": "relevance of the summary",
            "criteria": {  
                "1": "The summary's relevance is very poor, i.e., 1 out of 5.",
                "2": "The summary's relevance is poor, i.e., 2 out of 5.",
                "3": "The summary's relevance is barely acceptable, i.e., 3 out of 5.",
                "4": "The summary's relevance is good, i.e., 4 out of 5.",
                "5": "The summary's relevance is very good, i.e., 5 out of 5."
            },
            "labeling_notes": [
                "Relevance reflects the selection of important content from the article. A relevant summary should include only important information from the article (inclusion of redundancies and excess information should be penalized)."
            ]
        }
    }


### Output format

The `output_format` list specifies that the model should generate a `label` and an `explanation`.

    output_format = [
        {
            "name": "label",
            "description": "label for the requirement"
        },
        {
            "name": "explanation",
            "description": "explanation for the label"
        }
    ]


### Instruction

The instruction informs the model of the task as follows:

    instruction = "Please use the criteria to label the article's summary."


### Data splits

The example dataset (`data_examples`) and the test dataset (`data_test`) are extracted from the labeled data via the 
function `example_test_split` using `example_size=0.4` (example set contains `640 = 0.4*1600` sentences).

    datapath = "data/grammatical-acceptability"  # name of directory where data is located
    data_unlabeled = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(datapath, "data_unlabeled.csv"))
    data_examples, data_test = example_test_split(labeled_data_path=os.path.join(datapath, "data_labeled.csv"),
                                                  rubrics=rubrics,
                                                  examples_size=0.3)

### Defining and running the labeler 

The labeler instance is defined by specifying a `model_id` (as named in `machine_labeler/config.yaml`). 

    model_id = "meta-llama/llama-3-8b-instruct"
    labeler = MachineLabeler(model_id=model_id,
                             rubrics=rubrics,
                             output_format=output_format,
                             data_examples=data_examples,
                             num_example_samples=2,
                             num_prompt_samples=3)

The unlabeled data is labeled via the following command:

    labeler.label(data_unlabeled, save_dir=f"../labels/{datapath}/{model_id}")

The labeling accuracy (on the test set) is evaluated via:

    evaluation = labeler.evaluate(data_test, save_dir=f"../labels/{datapath}/{model_id}/test")
    print(evaluation)

### Unlabeled data

Unlabeled data (`data/dialogue/data_unlabeled.csv`) consists of 1000 context-response pairs sampled uniformly at random
from the `hh-rlhf` dataset.

Schema for `data_unlabeled.csv`:
- `id` (`string`): unique identifier for the sentence
- `input_context` (`string`): a string representation of the user-assistant dialogue.

### Rubrics

The `rubrics` dictionary contains a rubric for each of the 12 submaxim dimensions. Criteria are defined based on the 
definitions in *Miehling et al., 2024*. For some of the submaxims, it is useful to use the `labeling_notes` field to 
inform the model of necessary definitions.

### Output format

The `output_format` list specifies that the model should generate a `label` and an `explanation`.

    output_format = [
        {
            "name": "label",
            "description": "label for the requirement"
        },
        {
            "name": "explanation",
            "description": "explanation for the label"
        }
    ]


### Instruction

The instruction indicates that the model should label the response subject to the criteria. Note that it is helpful to
indicate the response's speaker to the model (as most models seem to have a preference to default to labeling an 
assistant's turn). Recall that the placeholder value, `speaker`, must match the name in a `type_*` column in the data.

    instruction = "Please use the criteria to label the following {speaker}'s response subject to to the context."


### Data splits

Data splits are defined directly from the unlabeled and examples datasets.

    datapath = "data/dialogue"  # name of directory where data is located
    data_unlabeled = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(datapath, "data_unlabeled.csv"))
    data_examples = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(datapath, "data_examples.csv"))

### Defining and running the labeler 

The labeler instance is defined by specifying a `model_id` (as named in `machine_labeler/config.yaml`). 

    model_id = "meta-llama/llama-3-70b-instruct"
    labeler = MachineLabeler(model_id=model_id,
                             instruction=instruction,
                             rubrics=rubrics,
                             output_format=output_format,
                             data_examples=data_examples,
                             num_example_samples=2,
                             num_prompt_samples=5)

The unlabeled data is labeled via the following command:

    labeler.label(data_unlabeled, save_dir=os.path.join(datapath, model_id, "labels"))
