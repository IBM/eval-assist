An individual who is brilliant in the tech space and started in Silicon Valley. A quick search reveals that the provided description aligns with several prominent people known for their roles in tech companies.

In particular, Steve Jobs is a well-known venture capitalist and controversial figure who was once a prominent name in Silicon Valley due to his association with Apple and NeXT software. However, he isn't known for being solely a venture capitalist but rather a successful entrepreneur and co-founder of Apple Inc.

Comparatively, Tim Draper, a prominent venture capitalist, is known to associate with controversial stances and figure prominently in Silicon Valley. However, he doesn't entirely fit the description provided in the instruction.

Steve Jurvetson, on the other hand, is both a venture capitalist and has been controversial. He started his career at NeXT and is a recognized figure in Silicon Valley.

0,"For ""Truthfulness"", we check the accuracy of the provided response. Response 1, with ""Schindler's List"" as the answer, is incorrect since Schindler's List was released before 1980. Response 2, with ""Citizen Kane"", is also incorrect as Citizen Kane is not on the top of AFI's list of 100 greatest American movies that came out after 1980, it was released in 1941. The correct answer is The Shawshank Redemption which was released in 1994 and holds the 1st position in the AFI's list of 100 greatest American movies released after 1980. However, for the purpose of this task, we don't need to mention the correct answer as it's not relevant for our evaluation.

In contrast, Gerald Ford, mentioned in Response 2, was never selected as Time's Person of the Year during his presidency.

1,"Both answers are truthful but in a different way. Response 1 correctly observes that Mother Teresa was declared a saint before her death, but the declaration of sainthood typically happens posthumously. On the other hand, Response 2 rightly indicates that the actual canonisation ceremony occurred after her death.
